# AMI
AMI provides a generic infrastructure where plugins can search, index or transform structured documents on a high-through basis. The typical input is structured, normalized, tagged XHTML, possibly containing (or linked to) SVG and PNG files. The plugins are designed to analyse text or graphics or a combination according to the discipline. 

## Running
There are binaries provided with releases which enable running of ami's plugins; shell and batch scripts are provided to make running these easier. Detailed tutorials of these can be found in the ContentMine software tutorials.

Run on a CTree which contains scholarly.html files of the papers you are analysing. This can be made using Norma.

Schema
```
ami2-<pluginname> --project <foldername> <plugin option> <options relating to plugin>
ami2-gene --project zika --g.gene --g.type human
``` 

## Building

```
mvn package
```

After the build, shell scripts and batch files to run plugins are in `target/appassembler/bin/`.  Further documentation is in `docs/`.

## Plugins

AMI has a plugin architecture where each problem or community has its own plugin. Examples are "species", "sequence", "regex" and soon some chemistry.

It is often straightforward to develop text-based searches, and this is accessible to most committed scientists. Graphics is always harder and requires bespoke programming. Plugins have been developed for at least:

### text targets

 * indexing text by regular expressions (``regex``).
 * Genbank IDs
 * PDB ids
 * farm-related / agronomy terms
 * chemical species (OSCAR)
 * computational phylogenetics
 * terms identifying Ebola and other haemorrhagic diseases
 
### graphical targets

 * phylogenetic trees 
 * chemical structures
 
The plugin architecture is moderately stable and it requires very little alteration to the codebase to add a new one (hopefully soon this can be done automatically by configuration files).

### file structure

The input must be a QuickscrapeNorma directory (QSNorma). This must contain `scholarly.html` which is used for 
analysis. When a plugin is run, the output is to the `results` directory, wiwth a subdirectory for each plugin
and a sub-subdirectory for each plugin option: Example:


    http_www.foo_1_2/
        fulltext.xml
        fulltext.pdf
        scholarly.html
        results/
            words/
                frequency/
                    results.xml
                lengths/
                    results.xml
            regex/
                consort0/
                    results.xml
                publication/
                    results.xml
