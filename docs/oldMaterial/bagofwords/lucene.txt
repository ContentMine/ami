Writing a custom Analyzer that has a stemmer in the analyzer chain should suffice.

Here is the sample code that uses PorterStemFilter in Lucene 4.1

 class MyAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
  @Override
  protected TokenStreamComponents createComponents(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
    Tokenizer source = new LowerCaseTokenizer(version, reader);
    return new TokenStreamComponents(source, new PorterStemFilter(source));
  }
}
Please note that you MUST use the same custom Analyzer while querying which is used for indexing as well.

You may find the sample code for your version of Lucene in the corresponding PorterStemFilter documentation.
