         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Religiosity has been related to psychological wellbeing outcomes. Although this relationship
            is primarily based on studies of church attendance or prayer and wellbeing, more recent
            work has focused on the potential mechanisms that may mediate the religion-wellbeing
            findings. One of the major function of religion is finding of meaning of life and
            improving hope. Recent studies have indicated that hope and meaning of life are the
            potential variables mediate between religion and wellbeing. It was hypothesized that
            one pathway through which religiosity may exert its positive influence on psychological
            wellbeing is through finding meaning of life and improving hope. One study was conducted
            examining the relationships among spiritual experiences, hope, meaning of life and
            psychological wellbeing operationalized as satisfaction with life, positive affect
            and negative affect. The following research tools were used: Daily Spiritual Experiences
            Scale, Purpose in Life Test, Hearth Hope Index, Cantril Ladder, Positive and Negative
            Affect Schedule. Meaning of life and hope were noticed to mediate between spiritual
            experiences and satisfaction with life as well as between spiritual experiences and
            positive affect. Spiritual experiences were not related to negative affect. Both meaning
            of life and hope predicted negative affect. This study found meaning of life and hope
            to be an important factors in the religion-wellbeing relationship and related to positive
            psychological outcomes, including improved satisfaction with life and positive affect
            as well as reduced negative affect.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Thus far, the strongest empirical foundation has been formed by the conviction that
            religious-spiritual aspects of functionality are the source of the meaning of life,

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Among the Al-Anon group members, spiritual experiences were the source of meaning
            of life leading indirectly to an increase in satisfaction with life as well as to
            the distress level decrease (Wnuk et al.

            </span>). A parallel study was conducted among the Alcoholics Anonymous with the application
            of different wellbeing indicators. The increase in the frequency of spiritual experiences
            was revealed to be conducive to finding the meaning of life in alcohol addicts being
            members of the Alcoholics Anonymous community and finally reduced the hopelessness
            level (Wnuk

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Other studies proved that the relationship between the attitude toward Christianity
            and the sense of happiness was mediated through the meaning of life (French and Joseph
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). The results of studies conducted on a large sample of women were ambiguous. Apart
            from one measure of the meaning of life, this variable mediated between religiousness
            and the cognitive aspect of wellbeing in the form of the satisfaction with life. The
            meaning of life turned out not to mediate between religiousness and emotional indicators
            of psychological wellbeing in the form of negative and positive affect, irrespective
            of which research tool had been employed (Zika and Chamberlain 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR54">1988</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Similarly, among the Alcoholics Anonymous, the meaning of life was a variable that
            mediated between the religiousness indicators such as intrinsic religiousness, strength
            of religious faith, positive religious coping and the satisfaction with life (Wnuk

               </sup>
            </span>). That regularity has not been confirmed in relation to affective measures of psychological
            wellbeing, which seem to indicate that religiousness through the function of finding
            the meaning of life can influence only the cognitive components of wellbeing.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Among the entire range of approaches dealing with the meaning of life in psychology,
            the best known and widespread is logotheory, posed by the Viennese psychiatrist and
            philosopher, Victor Frankl (Auhagen 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR3">2000</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Frankl’s inspiration to articulate this therapy originates from the time spent
            in a concentration camp during the World War II. He noticed that in spite of severe
            physical deprivation, the prisoners who were able to find the meaning in the events
            happening to them were able to stay alive, while those who were not able to find purpose,
            experienced feelings of hopelessness, emptiness or senselessness, which, coupled with
            loss of physical vitality and stamina, led to disease and death (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR19">1962</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). According to Frankl, people have a natural disposition toward developing the meaning
            of life, which motivates them to analyze and search for a purpose in the events in
            which they participate. The later research confirmed that the ability to identify
            a purpose is an element 
            <i>sine qua non</i> of the sense of happiness (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">

               </sup>
            </span>). Individuals having problems with finding a purpose in their lives experience a
            state of “existential emptiness” characterized by feeling of boredom, anhedonia, hopelessness
            and the lack of motivation for engaging themselves in activity (Frankl

            hope induced by religious-spiritual factors is manifested by better quality of life

            Regardless of the approach, the studies on hope highlighted its multidimensional character.
            Hope reflects spheres of thought, feelings, behaviors, and relationships with other
            people. It consists of an element of predictability; it is future oriented but rooted
            in the present (Stephenson 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">
               <sup>

            </span>), and connected with the past sense of hope.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In medicine, the most frequent tool used to study hope is the Herth Hope Index. Hope
            is operationalized as a multidimensional, dynamic force of life, described as a certainty
            of achieving good, which for a hopeful individual is possible and personally important
            (Dufault and Martocchio 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR15">1985</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). According to this theory, hope is based on three main factors: the inner sense
            of time and future, the inner positive readiness and expectation, and the sense of
            connection with oneself and others. The first of them is manifested through the presence
            of goals, positive attitude toward the world, a conviction that every day brings a
            new chance, and carefree thoughts about the future. The inner positive readiness and
            expectation is realized through the ability to notice positive aspects, the feeling
            of being guided, conviction that life has meaning, and the ability to recall happy
            and joyful moments.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The feeling of connection with oneself and others refers both to oneself as well as
            to God and other people. It is realized due to the conviction of not being alone,
            comfort-giving faith, deep inner strength, and the ability of giving and receiving
            love (Herth 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">

               </sup>
            </span>). The main hope-supporting strategies are meaningful relations with other people,
            the ability of carefree feeling, determination, possessing courage and serenity, clear
            goals, spiritual convictions (faith), the ability of recalling positive memories and
            respecting and accepting the individuality of others (Herth

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This paper purposely integrates the religious and spiritual spheres. The terms ‘spirituality’
            and ‘religiousness’ are usually used interchangeably, as equivalents. According to
            the previous studies, some aspects of spirituality and religiousness are closely connected,
            whereas other spiritual spheres are loosely connected or independent of religious
            behaviors and motives (Heintz and Baruss 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). Nevertheless, spirituality seems to be an idea having a broader meaning than religiousness.
            Unlike religiousness, spirituality assumes the realization of non-religious goals,
            such as identity, affiliation, health, or wellbeing (Sawatzky et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">

               </sup>
            </span>). It means that one can develop spiritually without being religious. On the other
            hand, spiritual experience is the crucial element of religious development (Wnuk

                     on the continuum between 1 and 7, with 7 indicating maximum intensity related to the
                     meaning of life, and 1 indicating minimum intensity. The overall result is obtained
                     by adding the score from all the answers. The higher score indicates the stronger
                     meaning of life, the lower—the greater existential frustration. The score ranges between
                     20 and 140 points (Cekiera

            populations and different measures applied to investigate the religious-spiritual
            sphere. This means that the students’ spiritual experiences have the influence, through
            the mediating role of the meaning of life, not only on the cognitive indicators of
            psychological wellbeing, but also on its emotional aspects, however, only on those

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The results of this study have revealed that one of the crucial functions of religiousness/spirituality
            was the discovery of the meaning of life, which could be explained on the basis of
            the mechanisms of coping with stress by means of religious-spiritual values. The religious-spiritual
            activity through the meaning can play an important role in the process of coping with
            stress, in the stage of both primary and secondary assessment of the stress-generating
            situation. In the stage of the primary assessment, the influence of a stressor can
            be restricted due to finding the meaning of the events through belief that no evil
            can happen without God’s allowance, or through the perception of the situation by
            an individual as a test of his or her faith. In the secondary stage of the assessment,
            an individual can reduce the negative influence of a stressful situation by discovering
            its meaning through acceptance, religious reattribution, due to comprehension why
            a specific event happened, or due to a positive reinterpretation through identification
            and focusing on positive implications of the event (Park

            meaning of life, it was hope, which mediated between spiritual experiences and satisfaction
            with life, as well as between spiritual experiences and positive affect. The obtained
            results are concurrent with the results of studies among addicted individuals, where
            identical measures of wellbeing and religiousness/spirituality were used (Wnuk

            of hope. It is highly probable that hope is positively influenced by the spiritual
            experiences manifested by the feeling of the presence of God, being the main source
            of joy, strength, peace and balance, feeling of God’s help and guidance, experiencing
            God’s love directly or via other persons, acceptance of other people regardless of
            their activities, feeling of integrity with own life, of identity with the beauty
            of the surrounding world, and selfless care for others. Hope, in turn, is reflected
            in positive goals, positive perception of the world, conviction that every day is
            a new chance, confidence in good future, positive thinking, feeling of guidance, appreciating
            the value of life, ability of recalling happy memories, belief in not being alone,
            faith which gives comfort, inner strength, and ability to give and receive love. The
            enumerated above factors decide on the students’ wellbeing, which is indicated by
            satisfaction with life and positive affect revealed by such emotions as excitement,
            inspiration, pride, positive attitude, determination, etc.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The meaning of life and hope were related to both cognitive and emotional measures

            spiritual experiences and quality of life. This is not the first study which examines
            the meaning of life and hope as potential pathways through which religiosity/spirituality
            influences quality of life and wellbeing. In the present study, this mechanism was
            confirmed once again with the use of specific measures of religiosity/spirituality,
            wellbeing and students’ population.
