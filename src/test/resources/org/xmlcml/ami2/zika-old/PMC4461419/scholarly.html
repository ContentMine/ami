            and lineage diversification as well as for management, conservation, and utilization
            of plant genetic resources. In higher plants studies providing insights into the mechanisms
            creating and maintaining sympatric cryptic lineages are rare. Here, using microsatellites
            and chloroplast sequence data, morphometric analyses, and phenological observations,
            we ask whether sympatrically coexisting lineages in the common wetland plant 
            <i>Juncus effusus</i> are ecologically differentiated and reproductively isolated. Our results show two
            genetically highly differentiated, homoploid lineages within 
            <i>J</i>. 
            <i>effusus</i> that are morphologically cryptic and have similar preference for soil moisture content.
            However, flowering time differed significantly between the lineages contributing to
            reproductive isolation and the maintenance of these lineages. Furthermore, the later
            flowering lineage suffered less from predispersal seed predation by a 
            <i>Coleophora</i> moth species. Still, we detected viable and reproducing hybrids between both lineages
            and the earlier flowering lineage and 
            <i>J</i>. 
            <i>conglomeratus</i>, a coexisting close relative. Flowering time differentiation between the lineages
            can be explained by neutral divergence alone and together with a lack of postzygotic
            isolation mechanisms; the sympatric coexistence of these lineages is most likely the
            result of an allopatric origin with secondary contact.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The discovery and description of so far unrecognized biological diversity are fundamental
            to evolutionary biology (Hendry et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b44">2010</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Molecular analyses identifying lineages that are morphologically and taxonomically
            indistinguishable and hence are called “cryptic,” have become frequent in some taxonomic
            groups such as animals or fungi, but have been stated to be surprisingly rare in higher
            plants (Bickford et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b6">2007</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Obviously, the presence of cryptic lineages has major impact on management, conservation,
            and utilization of plant genetic resources that need to take into account the specific
            evolutionary history and current genetic structure (Tellier et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b86">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b86">2011</a>
               </sup>
            </span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The investigation of cryptic diversity, in particular cases of sympatrically occurring
            cryptic lineages, is challenging because of two fundamental questions that are tightly
            interlinked. First, how did these lineages evolve and second, how are they ecologically
            and functionally maintained? Although recently cryptic diversity has been revealed
            by DNA bar coding in several plant species (e.g., Ragupathy et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b74">2009</a>
               </sup>
            </span>; Ni et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>), studies providing detailed insights into the evolutionary mechanisms and ecological
            causes or consequences, respectively, still remain scarce. Here, we report on sympatric
            cryptic lineages in a common wetland plant and ask how reproductive isolation between
            lineages is maintained by phenological and ecological mechanisms in the face of hybridization
            and putative introgression. Furthermore, we seek for indications for an allopatric
            or sympatric evolutionary origin of these lineages.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The diversification of evolutionary lineages and the accumulation of functional and
            ecological divergence among groups of individuals are facilitated by barriers reducing
            effective gene flow (Rieseberg and Willis 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b79">2007</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). However, spatial separation is not always necessary to explain the formation of
            reproductive isolation between groups because even in sympatry both neutral processes
            and divergent selection can result in population divergence (Devaux and Lande 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b16">2008</a>
               </sup>
            </span>; Flaxman et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b32">2014</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Eventually, a combination of different isolation mechanisms often leads to an almost
            complete separation even between closely related groups (e.g., Ramsey et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b75">2003</a>
               </sup>
            </span>), which consequently may be accompanied by a divergence in neutral genetic variation.
            However, reproductive isolation between lineages is not necessarily accompanied by
            morphological trait divergence and thus reflected by taxonomy. The incongruence between
            morphology and taxonomic species boundaries in cryptic lineages has been explained
            by two general motives (Bickford et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b6">2007</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). First, uniform selection may promote morphological stasis or phenotypic convergence
            between genetically and reproductively well-isolated lineages. Second, more recently
            diverged and therefore morphologically similar lineages can be genetically differentiated
            due to reproductive isolation. Mechanisms of reproductive isolation can be generally
            categorized depending upon whether they act before or after zygote formation: For
            example, prezygotic isolation can result from extrinsic barriers such as spatial or
            temporal separation (e.g., Ellis et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b20">2006</a>

               </sup>
            </span>) or from intrinsic barriers via conspecific gamete precedence (Howard 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b46">1999</a>

               </sup>
            </span>). Postzygotic isolation can be mediated via ovule abortion or lower hybrid fitness,
            which can be expressed, for example, in reduced hybrid seed weight or fertility (see
            examples in Levin 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). In cryptic lineages, such isolation mechanisms can affect reproductive interaction
            directly via acoustical and chemical communication in animals (Henry 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). In higher plants, however, reproductive isolation may be driven more indirectly
            by pollinator preferences (Bower and Brown 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>) or by temporal separation of flowering time (Silvertown et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b83">2005</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Often, cryptic lineages in higher plants are the result of ploidy heterogeneity
            (e.g., Schönswetter et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>) which can instantly lead to reproductive isolation via pre- and postzygotic barriers
            and which has been stated to be a major driver for speciation processes in flowering
            plants (Otto and Whitton 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">
               <sup>

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b8">2011</a>

               </sup>
            </span>), and with time after divergence, additional pre- and postzygotic barriers are expected
            to accumulate. In sympatric lineages, the nature of reproductive isolation is often
            more difficult to elucidate as both pre- and postzygotic mechanisms have to be considered
            jointly (Whittall et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b91">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b91">2004</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Moreover, the selective potential of biotic interactions in a shared environment
            might alter the strength of potential isolating mechanisms, as, for example, shared
            predispersal seed predators are putatively a strong selective agent on inflorescence
            and flower morphology as well as the timing of reproduction (Elzinga et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">

               </sup>
            </span>). Thus, the understanding of sympatric coexistence of cryptic and possibly functionally
            similar lineages needs to take into account multiple nonexclusive factors such as
            reproductive and other biotic interactions, but also resource partitioning, microenvironmental
            heterogeneity, or even neutral processes (Chesson

               <i>eff2</i> to hybrid formation. As flowers are wind pollinated and homogamous and other unidirectional

               in local abundance of parental lineages (Lepais et al.
