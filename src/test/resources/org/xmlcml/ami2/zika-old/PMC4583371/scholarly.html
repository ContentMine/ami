               or antibodies directed against the virus in blood samples. Blood, however, may be
               difficult to draw in some patients, especially in children, and sampling during outbreak
               investigations or epidemiological studies may face logistical challenges or limited
               compliance to invasive procedures from subjects. The aim of this study was to assess
               the possibility of using saliva and urine samples instead of blood for dengue diagnosis.

               the day of admission to hospital until three months after the onset of fever in children
               with confirmed dengue disease. Quantitative RT-PCR, NS1 antigen capture and ELISA
               serology for anti-DENV antibody (IgG, IgM and IgA) detection were performed in parallel
               on the three body fluids. RT-PCR and NS1 tests demonstrated an overall sensitivity
               of 85.4%/63.4%, 41.6%/14.5% and 39%/28.3%, in plasma, urine and saliva specimens,
               respectively. When urine and saliva samples were collected at the same time-points
               and tested concurrently, the diagnostic sensitivity of RNA and NS1 detection assays
               was 69.1% and 34.4%, respectively. IgG/IgA detection assays had an overall sensitivity
               of 54.4%/37.4%, 38.5%/26.8% and 52.9%/28.6% in plasma, urine and saliva specimens,
               respectively. IgM were detected in 38.1% and 36% of the plasma and saliva samples
               but never in urine.

            a huge public health burden in affected countries. Symptoms are often non-specific
            hence the need for an early, sensitive and specific diagnosis of dengue for appropriate
            management as well as for early epidemic detection. Currently, almost all laboratory
            diagnostic methods require a blood specimen that may be sometimes be difficult or
            inconvenient to obtain. In this study, we assessed the possibility to use saliva and
            urine samples as alternatives to blood specimens in dengue diagnosis. We demonstrated
            that the performances of the different diagnostic methods (RT-PCR, NS1 antigen detection
            and anti-DENV IgM/IgG/IgA ELISAs) were in general not as good in saliva and urine
            as in plasma, but that the use of these body fluids obtained by non-invasive methods
            could be of value in certain circumstances such as outbreak investigations or in young
            children (once they are old enough to comply to instructions), in addition to the
            situations when blood cannot be easily collected (e.g., lack of phlebotomist, refusal
            of the procedure, etc.).

            humans. Several factors such as rapid urbanization, failure to control mosquitoes
            and rapid progress in air transportation have contributed to the emergence of endemic
            dengue in 128 countries in the world [

            in diagnosis, the true incidence and burden of dengue are very likely under estimated.
            Using new modeling approaches, Bhatt et al. estimated that approximately 3.97 billion
            people were living in areas where DENV is circulating and that almost 400 million

            is capable of producing life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome,
            and non-specific complication of systemic diseases (e.g. encephalitis, hepatitis)

            </span>]. The course of dengue illness can be divided in three main phases: the febrile phase,
            the critical phase and the recovery phase. Severe clinical disease manifestations
            such as fluid leakage, bleeding and shock occurs during the critical phase which begins
            around day 4–7 after the onset of fever, when the temperature drops under 38°C, and
            lasts usually between 48 to 72 hours. During the critical phase, the condition of
            patients experiencing a severe form of the disease worsens as a result of plasma leakage
            whereas the condition of patients with a non-severe disease improves.

            genome by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or detection of
            NS1 antigen. Indirect diagnosis using serological methods to detect anti-DENV IgM
            and IgG is commonly employed, while IgA tests remain less commonly used. The selection
            of diagnostic methods depends greatly on the time-point of the sample collection during
            the course of the disease. RT-PCR and virus isolation require a blood sample collected
            during the early febrile phase of the disease (0–5 days after the onset of fever)
            [

               </sup>
            </span>]. A sample obtained during the early phase is also preferred for NS1 detection, but
            in patients experiencing a primary infection the NS1 antigen remains detectable for
            nine days or more after the onset of fever [

            IgA, however, can persist in blood during several weeks or even months after the infection
            while IgG may persist for decades. Differentiating between an acute and a recent DENV
            infection by these methods may therefore be challenging. Currently almost all laboratory
            diagnostic methods require a blood sample that may be difficult to obtain in children,
            the population which is most commonly affected by dengue in endemic regions, especially
            in field conditions or outbreak settings. Saliva and urine samples could be used as
            surrogates for blood as the collection of these body fluids is non-invasive and better
            accepted by patients, does not require medically-trained staff and the samples are
            easier to process as they require only limited laboratory facilities.

               genome, the NS1 antigen or the anti-DENV antibodies in the three different fluids,
               multivariate analysis using a boosted regression tree (BRT) approach was used. BRT
               is a method combining regression trees with weak individual predictive performances
               into a single model with higher performance. We used BRT because it is capable of
               dealing with complex responses, including non-linear relationships and interactions
               between explanatory variables [

                  </sup>
               </span>], and we were expecting such complex relationships between our explanatory and response
               variables. As part of the final model, the BRT assesses the relative importance (RI)
               of each explanatory variable based on the number of times a variable is used in all
               trees and its contribution to the final model improvement. A higher RI of a predictor
               indicates a stronger influence on the response in question (i.e. the detection of
               each diagnostic marker, in this study). The effect of each explanatory variable on
               the response can be visualized by the use of partial dependence plots. For each model
               with a binary response variable, a Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was
               constructed and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated. The AUC ranges
               between 0.5 for random prediction to 1, the higher the AUC the better the model performance.
               For models with a continuous response variable, the performance of the model was estimated
               by a correlation coefficient between observed and predicted datasets. This correlation
               coefficient ranges between 0 (no correlation) and 1 (perfect correlation), with values
               superior to 0.5 suggesting a high correlation. The analysis was carried out using
               the “dismo” package (version 1.0–5) [

               of fever until the 10
               <sup>th</sup> day after fever onset, tested positive. Out of the 442 urine and the 562 saliva samples
               obtained between the day of fever onset until the 28
               <sup>th</sup> day after the onset of fever (DAOF 28) from 118 and 132 patients, respectively, 41.6%

               by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results are presented based on days of sampling after the
               onset of fever (

               from a minimum of 13.6% during the first 2 days after fever onset to a maximum of
               66.6% at DAOF 9–10. At the latest time-points, the proportion of urine samples positive
               by qRT-PCR was approximately the same as the proportion of RNA-positive plasma specimens
               (71.4% and 62.5% at DAOF 9–10, respectively). DENV RNA remained detectable in one
               urine sample at DAOF 16. The detection rate of viral RNA by qRT-PCR in saliva samples
               followed the decreasing curve of the RNA detection rate observed in the plasma specimens.
               The highest proportion of saliva samples that tested positive for DENV RNA was observed
               between the first day and the 4
               <sup>th</sup> day of fever (60.5% at DAOF 0–2, 63.9% at DAOF 3 and 58.5% at DAOF 4) whereas plasma
               samples collected at the same time-points were RNA-positive in 96% to 100% of the
               cases. The RNA detection rate in saliva decreased thereafter (44.2%, 30.9%, 23.9%,
               9.9%, 16% and 8.3% at DAOF 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, respectively), and all samples tested
               negative after DAOF 10. By comparison with the percentage of plasma samples positive
               by qRT-PCR, the sensitivity of qRT-PCR in saliva was on average 46.2% lower, with
               a minimal difference of 36.1% at DAOF 3 and a maximal difference of 55.4% at DAOF
               9.

               sensitivity if the plasma was tested alone, 91.8% when both urine and plasma specimens
               were tested in parallel. The diagnostic sensitivity increased from 85% for plasma

               subjects whose saliva samples tested positive also had detectable RNA levels in their
               corresponding plasma samples. If both the urine and the saliva samples collected at
               the same time-points were screened for DENV-RNA the diagnostic sensitivity increased
               to 69.1% (168/243, CI95 = [62.9–74.9]). If saliva and urine specimens were tested
               in parallel instead of testing the plasma, the overall diagnostic sensitivity decreased
               by 21.4% (by 16.7% if the samples were collected at DAOF 0–1 or at DAOF 6–7, by 22.4%
               at DAOF 3–4, by 23% at DAOF 4–5, and by 24.4% for samples obtained during the 2

               different body fluids, the impact of the explanatory variable “classif” (severe versus
               non-severe dengue) was negligible. The detection of IgG in plasma specimens was explained
               by the variables “daof” and “status” with a close relative importance (47.2% and 49.3%,
               respectively) (

               with secondary infection and that IgG antibodies were detected from one week until
               the end of the follow-up period (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004100.g007">Fig 7</span>). For the detection of IgM in plasma specimens, the variable “daof” appeared to be
               the only explanatory variable and was associated with a RI of 95.4%. The RIs of the
               variables “status” and “classif” were negligible at 3.3% and 1.4% (

               by the variable “daof” (RI = 69.8%) and was the highest between one and four weeks

               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004100.g007">Fig 7</span>). The immune status of the patient (secondary infection) also contributed to explain
               the ability to detect IgA antibodies (RI = 26.2%) (

               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004100.g007">Fig 7</span>). The detection of antibodies in saliva samples was linked mainly to the level of
               the corresponding class of immunoglobulin in plasma (IgG detection: RI = 50.8%; IgM
               detection: RI = 68.5%; IgA detection: RI = 58.4%). Similarly, the detection of IgA
               antibody in urine samples correlated with the titer of IgA in plasma (RI = 60.2%).
               The relative importance of plasmatic IgG level appeared to be only 20.3% for the detection
               of IgG in urine specimens. The main variables associated with the presence of IgG
               in urine samples were the immunological status (RI = 42.1% in secondary infections)
               and the date of sampling (RI = 36%) (

            urine specimens instead of blood for the diagnosis of dengue infections in specific
            situations. The evaluation included the assays most routinely used for dengue diagnosis:
            viral genome detection by qRT-PCR, virus isolation in mosquito cell lines, NS1 antigen
            and anti-DENV antibody detection by ELISA methods. In order to generate the strongest
            data possible, a large number of samples obtained from children hospitalized in Cambodia
            for dengue of varying degrees of severity were tested. This is the first study in
            which plasma, urine and saliva obtained from the same patients, at the same time-points,
            were tested in parallel and the results compared to estimate the performances of the
            various dengue diagnostic assays.

            the patient’s participation. If devices for urine sampling in infants exist and if
            saliva can be collected with small specific swabs, one may consider that in the youngest
            children the collection of capillary blood on filter paper after a finger-prick could
            be a better alternative to venipuncture than urine or saliva sampling.

            of saliva samples and to comprehensively describe the kinetics of DENV genome detection
            in this body fluid. Previously, Anders 
            <i>et al</i>. attempted to detect the DENV genome in saliva swab specimens obtained from six patients
            with confirmed DENV infection but all samples tested negative [

               </sup>
            </span>]. We demonstrated here that, as in the plasma, the sensitivity of the genome detection
            in saliva specimens was the highest during the early acute phase of the infection
            (i.e., 63.9% at day 3 post-fever; approximately 60% during the four first days of
            the disease) and then decreased over time before the RNA became undetectable 10 days
            after the onset of fever. The curves of the sensitivity of the RNA detection in plasma
            and saliva specimens had very similar profiles over time. Nevertheless, the sensitivity
            of the qRT-PCR in saliva was on average 40% lower than in plasma when the specimens
            were tested between DAOF0 and DAOF8. The BRT analysis indicated that the higher the
            RNA load in plasma, the higher the probability of detecting the viral RNA in saliva
            samples was.

            at the time of hospital discharge (up to10 days after onset of fever) tested negative,
            whereas their urine collected at the same time was positive. The sensitivity of the
            confirmation of the dengue infection by viral genome detection improved from 79.6%
            to 82.6% when qRT-PCR was performed in both urine and plasma samples collected after
            the 5
            <sup>th</sup> day of fever, compared to qRT-PCR in plasma alone. Nevertheless, even after DAOF
            5, plasma remained the best biological fluid to use for dengue diagnosis. Indeed,
            out of the 116 pairs of urine and plasma samples collected during the early convalescent
            phase of the disease from the same patients, 63.8% were concordant (i.e., both urine
            and plasma samples tested positive or both urine and plasma samples tested negative).
            Only three pairs demonstrated discordant results with an advantage for urine over
            plasma whereas 39 pairs gave discordant results in favor of plasma (i.e. the urine
            sample tested negative whereas the corresponding plasma sample tested positive). After
            discharge from the hospital, the urine sample of three other patients still tested
            positive (two patients at DAOF 13 and one patient at DAOF 16) but the comparison with
            plasma was not possible as blood samples were unavailable for these time points. All
            patients whose saliva samples tested positive also had detectable levels of RNA in
            the plasma samples collected at the same time-points. Thus, testing saliva in addition
            to the plasma samples did not significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity. When it
            is not possible to get blood samples, testing concurrently both urine and saliva specimens
            by qRT-PCR could offer an interesting alternative as the overall diagnostic sensitivity
            was 76.1% during the acute phase of the disease (DAOF 0–5) and 59.4% during the early
            convalescent phase (DAOF 6–12). Alternatively, the analysis of sequential urine or
            saliva specimens could also provide, in specific situations, some acceptable results
            as 57% of the patients had at least one positive urine sample and almost 69% of them
            had a least one saliva sample that tested positive in the course of the disease.

            for the absence of virus detection. It rather appeared that a low viral load was at
            the origin of an absence of detection of infectious virus in saliva and urine specimens.
            But it is also possible that the DENV RNA detected by qRT-PCR in urine was “free”
            viral RNA that was able to go through the glomeruli while virus particles, especially
            those embedded in large immune complexes, were stopped.

            We decided not to concentrate urine specimens before testing for NS1 in order to keep
            the ELISA protocol as easy and cheap as possible to meet the “real-life” conditions
            of most endemic countries which are also often developing countries. Saito

            incidence during a serological survey and demonstrated that anti-DENV IgG detection

            that of IgG in plasma during the first week of the disease. Subsequently, urinary
            excretion of IgG decreases over time while it remains stable in plasma. Three months
            after disease onset, 76.1% of the patients had detectable anti-DENV IgG in their plasma
            whereas only 12.5% of them still tested positive in their urine. The present study
            is the first to document the kinetics of anti-DENV antibodies until the third month
            after fever onset. Multivariate analysis showed that the detection of anti-DENV IgG
            in urine was not primarily associated with antibody titers in plasma but with the
            immune status of the patient and with the time of sampling after the onset of the
            disease. Antibodies are high-molecular-weight (HMW) proteins. In physiologic conditions,
            these proteins are almost completely restricted from filtration by the glomerular
            barrier and only a very small quantity of it can normally be detected in urine. The
            presence of macromolecules such as IgG and IgA in urine could reflect an alteration
            of the glomerular barrier, with or without tubular cells impairment. IgM is a pentameric
            immunoglobulin of very high molecular weight (950 kDa) and its detection in urine
            would reflect a severe glomerular injury [

            infection in some situations when optimal sensitivity is not necessarily required.
            These two body fluids provide different type of information. The saliva essentially
            mirrors what happens in the blood, which is not surprising as approximately 2.5% of
            the whole saliva is composed of gingival fluid, a protein-rich serum transudate, therefore
            reflecting the protein pattern in the serum. Antibodies titers in saliva are thus

            and NS1 protein (300 kDa) most likely reflects an alteration of the glomerular filtration
            barrier which has three major components: the glomerular endothelial cells (GECs),
            the glomerular basement membrane and the podocytes. One of the characteristics of
            GECs is the presence of numerous fenestrations, which in theory should allow the passage
            of large molecules. GECs, however, are coated by a glycocalyx layer composed of glycosaminoglycans,
            which in normal conditions impedes the leakage of macromolecules. Abnormal disruption
            of the glycocalyx restores the passage of big molecules through the fenestration of
            the GECs [

            here were not as good in saliva and urine as in plasma, results obtained with qRT-PCR
            and with antibody detection could justify the use of these two body fluids for the
            diagnosis of dengue infection for instances such as outbreak investigations or in
            young children (once they are old enough to comply to instructions), in addition to
            the situations when blood cannot be easily collected (e.g., lack of phlebotomist,
            refusal of the procedure, etc.). The disadvantage resulting from a slight decrease
            in the diagnostic confirmation performances when using molecular and serological tests
            in urine and saliva samples instead of blood is partially balanced by the ease to
            obtain these specimens and by the better compliance of the patient or by the number
            of individuals that can be investigated during studies when non-invasive sample collection
            methods are used. Moreover, the modest sensitivity of the test can be offset by high
            prevalence during the peak of an outbreak and/or when guided by competent clinicians.
            It results in high predictive positive value, making this test a useful addition for
            biological diagnosis in field conditions.
