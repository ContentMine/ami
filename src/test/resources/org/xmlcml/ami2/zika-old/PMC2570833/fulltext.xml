These agents are: chlorine, chlorine dioxide, chloramine, and ozone. Significant findings include the production of similar nonchlorinated organic oxidation products from chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone. In addition, all three chlorinous oxidants/disinfectants can produce chlorinated by-products under certain conditions. The presence of chloronitrile compounds in drinking waters is indicated to arise from reactions of chlorine or chloramine to amine/amide functions in amino acids or proteinaceous materials, followed by dehydrohalogenation. These nitriles could hydrolyze to produce the corresponding chloroacetic acids. It is concluded that to minimize the presence of oxidation by-products in drinking waters, the concentrations of oxidizable organic/inorganic impurities should be lowered before any oxidizing agent is added.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0037.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="31" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0038.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="32" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0039.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="33" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0040.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="34" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0041.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="35" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0042.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="36" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0043.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="37" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0044.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="38" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0045.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="39" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0046.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="40" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0047.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="41" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0048.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="42" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0049.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="43" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="envhper00440-0050.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="44" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
