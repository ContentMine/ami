Aquaporins (AQPs) are an evolutionary conserved family of membrane transporter proteins that regulate the flow of water and in some cases glycerol and other small molecules across cellular membranes. In a previous study, we found six putative AQP genes in the genome of the yellow fever mosquito, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and demonstrated the involvement of three of them in the blood meal-induced diuresis. Here we characterized AQP expression in different tissues before and after a blood meal, explored the substrate specificity of AQPs expressed in the Malpighian tubules and performed RNAi-mediated knockdown and tested for changes in mosquito desiccation resistance. We found that AQPs are generally down-regulated 24&#x02005;hrs after a blood meal. <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> AQP 1 strictly transports water, AQP 2 and 5 demonstrate limited solute transport, but primarily function as water transporters. AQP 4 is an aquaglyceroporin with multiple substrates. Knockdown of AQPs expressed in the MTs increased survival of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> under dry conditions. We conclude that Malpighian tubules of adult female yellow fever mosquitoes utilize three distinct AQPs and one aquaglyceroporin in their osmoregulatory functions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The yellow fever mosquito, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, is a tropical mosquito with a worldwide distribution. It is the vector for dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses and it also transmits lesser known pathogens such as Zika virus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>.</p><p>As an anautogenous mosquito, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females require the uptake of vertebrate blood for reproduction. Blood meals are relatively large and can more than double the mass of a mosquito within a couple of minutes. Shortly after beginning a blood meal, mosquitoes start to produce large amounts of urine in order to concentrate the nutrients taken up and to eliminate excess sodium from the blood. They begin ejecting droplets of urine while still blood feeding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In order to move this large volume of water, females use their highly efficient excretion system. Water and solutes are absorbed by the midgut into the hemolymph and from there are secreted by the Malpighian tubules (MTs) back into the alimentary canal where it is excreted through the hindgut and rectum<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. MTs are the functional equivalent of vertebrate kidneys and contain protein channels and transporters that facilitate the transport of water and other solutes across the basal and apical membrane of their cells.</p><p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of membrane transporters that regulate the flow of water and in some cases other small molecules across cellular membranes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and they are important players in the mosquito excretory system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. There are 13 AQP genes in mammals, which consist of two subfamilies. The first subfamily is the AQPs, which are thought to pass only water, the second are the aquaglyceroporins, which in addition to water pass small, nonpolar solutes like glycerol and urea<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The AQP channel forms an hourglass structure with six transmembrane alpha helical domains connected by five extramembrane loops. The asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA) motif is in the center of the pore and forms a ring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. This ring is the primary filter of the channel and regulates the flow of water through the channel. Previous studies have shown that Hg<sup>2+</sup> ions can interact with a cysteine residue near the NPA motif and block the flow of water molecules through the channel of most AQPs. Aquaglyceroporins differ from AQPs in pore size and amino acid composition of the channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.</p><p>In earlier work, we surveyed the genome of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and identified six putative AQP genes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Combining microarray, reverse transcription and qPCR data, we found that all six AQPs are expressed in distinct patterns in the female mosquito and at different time points before and after a blood meal. RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQPs 1, 4, or 5 significantly reduced the ability of mosquitoes to excrete injected saline<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Furthermore, the simultaneous knockdown of AQPs 1, 2, 4, and 5 further reduced the excretion rate. This suggests that AQPs 1, 4, and 5 form the primary water channels in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> MTs.</p><p>Here we have confirmed that the AQPs expressed in the MTs (AQPs 1, 2, 4, and 5) function as water channels and mediate transcellular water transport in adult female <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic>. We demonstrate that these proteins are indeed water channels and that AQP 4 is a multifunctional aquaglyceroporin that is capable of transporting a wide range of solutes. Lastly, individually knocking down AQPs 1, 4, and 5 increased the resistance of mosquitoes to desiccation stress.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Tissue expression</title><p>We used qPCR to evaluate relative AQP mRNA expression in different parts of the alimentary canal in female mosquitoes at two time points - 72&#x02005;hrs post eclosion (PE) and 24&#x02005;hrs post blood meal (PBM). We found that each AQP had a varied expression profile throughout the different organs/tissues observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). AQP 1 was significantly upregulated in the midgut (MG) and the MTs PE. We observed a trend in AQP 1 expression in the hindgut (HG) PE, but it was not significantly upregulated. AQP 1 was downregulated in these tissues PBM. AQP 2 was significantly expressed in the foregut (FG), MG, and HG, and we observed a trend in the expression in the MTs PE, but this was not significant. This AQP was downregulated in these tissues PBM. There is no significant difference in AQP 3 expression levels in all the tissues before and after a blood meal. AQP 4 was significantly upregulated in the MTs and we observed a trend in expression levels in the MG PE, but this was not significant. These expression levels were downregulated PBM. AQP 5 is significantly upregulated in the MTs PE. We also observed a trend in AQP 5 expression in the MG PE, but this was not significant. AQP 5 expression was downregulated in these tissues PBM. There is no significant difference in AQP 6 expression levels in all the tissues before and after a blood meal.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Water uptake assays</title><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes are naturally impermeable to water and thereby are an ideal model system to study the water transport properties of heterologously expressed AQPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

There were no changes in the water permeation of the control oocytes in the HgCl<sub>2</sub> solution, consistent with nominal endogenous AQP expression.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Solute uptake assays</title><p>To investigate the substrate specificities of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> AQPs, they were expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, which were subsequently subjected to non-radiolabeled solute transport analyses with six different solutes: glycerol, urea, erythritol, adonitol, mannitol, and trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). AQP 1-expressing oocytes closely resembled the water-injected oocytes and did not demonstrate significant solute uptake. AQP 2-expressing oocytes also did not show significant solute uptake compared to the water-injected oocytes. Oocytes injected with AQP 4 cRNA consistently swelled in various test solutes to ~1.3 times their initial volume and ruptured within minutes. AQP 4 did not function as a strong water transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), but this AQP has significant transport capabilities for all other solutes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). AQP 5 demonstrated significantly high solute transport for trehalose. The results show a trend in the uptake of erythritol and adonitol via AQP 5, but the solute uptake was not significantly different than the water-injected oocytes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mosquito desiccation resistance assays</title><p>AQPs 1, 4, and 5 were knocked down individually in adult female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes 72&#x02005;hrs PE by injecting dsRNA followed by a three day recovery period.

We did not include AQP 2 in this experiment since <italic>in-vivo</italic> diuresis assays performed in Drake et al., 2010 did not result in a significant rate of excretion for the AQP 2 knockdown group of mosquitoes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.

Compared to this wealth of knowledge relatively little is known about insect AQPs.

In haematophagous insects, AQPs have been shown to be important for regulation of water homeostasis, desiccation resistance, blood meal compaction, and general osmoregulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. In the case of the viviparous tsetse fly for milk production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>The first mosquito AQP was cloned from <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, AeaAQP or AaAQP 1, which is a close homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> DRIP. AaAQP 1 is localized in the tracheolar cells that are associated with MTs, and it is strictly a water channel when expressed heterologously in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. A homologous gene, AgAQP 1 has also been cloned and characterized in <italic>Anopheles</italic><italic>gambiae.</italic> AgAQP 1 transports water but not glycerol and is expressed in the MG, OV and MTs and plays a role in water homeostasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. In the MTs, AgAQP 1 localizes to the basolateral membranes of stellate cells in the distal and proximal segments, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Furthermore, two splice variants of AgAQP 1 are expressed in an organ-specific manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>The alimentary canal of the mosquito consists of the primary organs/tissues involved in digestion and excretion of nutrients and fluids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. In <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, most water from blood meals is absorbed by the MG into the hemolymph and then secreted by the MTs. Concurringly, our results revealed that AQPs 1, 2, 4, and 5 were highly expressed in the MG and MTs, which confirmed data from a previous analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. AQP 2 is also highly expressed in the FG and HG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) which implies that these parts of the gut might also be involved in blood meal dehydration.</p><p>Blood meal dehydration is a very efficient process. After three hours, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females can excrete 75% of the total blood meal volume as urine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. After mosquitoes take blood, they seek out a resting place to allow vitellogenesis and egg development to take place during the next days. Post- blood meal diuresis typically subsides around 2&#x02005;hours after a mosquito takes a blood meal, which has been shown in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. This matches the fact that we found many AQPs down regulated in the MTs and the MG at the 24&#x02005;hrs PBM time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Interestingly, AQP 3 has similar expression levels before and after a blood meal in all alimentary canal tissues including the MTs. AQP 3 is most closely related to BIB-like AQPs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. BIB was first characterized in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and named <underline>bi</underline>g <underline>b</underline>rain (BIB) (CG4722 in FlyBase)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. This AQP does not function as a water channel in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, instead, it is involved in the regulation of cell to cell adhesion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>.</p><p>Our results confirm that AQP 1 is a strict water channel<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, and this is also true for AQP 2. These observations suggest that AQPs 1, 2, and 5 are the main water channels in the MG and the MT and raise the possibility that these AQPs might be functioning together for efficient water permeability in these organs. This redundancy of function has been observed in previous studies in which multiple AQPs act together in the same tissue. For instance, in tsetse flies, the combined knockdown of three AQPs significantly extended larval pregnancy and ultimately led to dehydration of the developing larva while knockdown of a single AQP gene had a much weaker effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>To date, only a handful of aquaglyceroporins have been identified in insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. RhoprMIP from the kissing bug, <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> facilitates the transport of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. In the pea aphid, <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>, there is another identified aquaglyceroporin, ApAQP 2, which has been shown to be a multifunctional transport channel capable of passing a wide range of linear polyols, including glycerol, mannitol, and sorbitol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Here we present the first characterization of aquaglyceroporins in a mosquito. <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> AQP 4 did demonstrate the lowest water permeability from all AQPs in our study, but significantly enhanced the uptake of all other solutes we tested - linear polyols, urea, and trehalose. The solute with the strongest uptake by AQP 4-expressing oocytes was glycerol, which is a precursor for the synthesis of triacylglycerols and of phospholipids and has also been shown to be important for insect cold tolerance and diapause<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> AQP 5-expressing oocytes also demonstrated significant solute permeability for trehalose. Trehalose is the primary sugar circulating in the hemolymph of an insect and can be considered insect &#x02018;blood sugar'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. This molecule is the primary energy store in the mosquito and it is up regulated in the event of environmental stresses such as temperature changes and dehydration. In <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, a trehalose transporter, AgTreT1, is highly expressed in the fat body and transports trehalose into the hemolymph<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. Interestingly, both, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> AQP 4 and 5, demonstrated significant transport of trehalose in the uptake assays. This is the first study that suggests transport of trehalose via a multifunctional aquaglyceroporin channel and proposes potential novel roles of these AQPs in regulation of mosquito hemolymph trehalose levels or uptake of circulating trehalose into tissues.</p><p>In 2005, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were distributed throughout 23 of the United States in South and South-eastern regions including Southern Florida, Gulf coast of Texas and Louisiana. Recently, this distribution has spread to more arid and dry regions, such as Arizona and New Mexico. This raises the question as to how this tropical mosquito manages water conservation in the desert. Previous studies have shown that AQPs play a role in insect desiccation resistance and cold hardiness. For example, RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQP 1 in <italic>Anopheles</italic>
<italic>gambiae</italic> resulted in significantly longer survival of the knockdown group compared with the control group under desiccating conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. In the goldenrod gall fly, <italic>Eurosta solidaginis</italic>, AQPs promote larval cell survival during freezing conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Our results confirm the role that AQPs play in maintaining water homeostasis in adult mosquitoes. More specifically, the ability of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to conserve water in an extremely dry environment was significantly enhanced after RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQPs 1, 4, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). This suggests that the regulation of AQP expression in the alimentary canal could be an adaptive strategy to attenuate excretory water losses when <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are exposed to an arid environment. How this is balanced with the need for rapid excretion after a blood meal is an interesting topic for future studies.</p><p>In summary, our current findings confirm that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> AQPs 1, 2, and 5 transport water and are involved in the regulation of mosquito water homeostasis. AQP 4 is a multifunctional aquaglyceroporin with a wide range of solute transport capabilities. AQP 5 also functions as a limited aquaglyceroporin in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. Down regulation of AQPs 1, 4, and 5 enhanced mosquito desiccation resistance. Our data provide a basis for further investigation into the transport capabilities of mosquito AQPs. Further research is necessary to determine how expression and activity of these AQPs are regulated in mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Maintaining mosquito strains</title><p>The <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito Rockefeller strain was used in all experiments.
