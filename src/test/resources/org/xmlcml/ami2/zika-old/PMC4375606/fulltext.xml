The 20th century was characterized by massive productivity increases, accompanied by gradual land abandonment and the return of forest land. We here analyze 120 years of land system change in Italy, applying the human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) framework, a metric for socio-economic pressures on terrestrial ecosystems. HANPP allows integrating ecological with societal perspectives, by systematically quantifying (a) biomass harvest and (b) the difference between potential productivity of ecosystems and current productivity induced by land use processes, such as land conversion, or land degradation. Besides assessing national trends we calculated HANPP separately for the Italian North and South between 1934 and 2007, in order to scrutinize if high regional discrepancies in terms of natural and socio-economic preconditions translate into diverging land system trajectories. Our results show that national HANPP has been declining from 78% of natural productivity before WWII to 56% in 2007, indicating a declining land -use induced pressure on biomass flows over time. Simultaneously, biomass harvest increased by around 26% due to agricultural intensification, despite shrinking croplands. Although we found a significant difference between the Northern and Southern region in the absolute levels of several land use indicators related to biomass appropriation, the overarching trends of land system change were remarkably similar in both regions. This suggests that underlying drivers of land system change, such as policies aimed at land-use intensification and structural change were equally dominating land system trajectories in the North and South of Italy, not withstanding their socio-ecological divergences.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Long-term land system change</kwd><kwd>Italy</kwd><kwd>HANPP</kwd><kwd>Socio-ecological perspective</kwd><kwd>Land use intensification</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec0005"><title>Introduction</title><p>Land use provides essential resources to society and at the same time is one of the most central factors for accelerating global environmental change, which increasingly jeopardizes human well-being (<xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Foley et al., 2005</xref>).

Analysing how land systems have reacted to changing underlying drivers in the past has been highlighted as key to tackle these knowledge gaps and as a precondition for preparing for future land system changes (<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Dearing et al., 2010</xref>). Long-term case studies have proven a powerful approach for scrutinizing the general principles of land system change (<xref rid="bib0175 bib0190 bib0335 bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Krausmann et al., 2013, 2012; Singh et al., 2013; DeFries et al., 2004</xref>), particularly in terms of analysing effects of rapid change and megatrends such as urbanization or the increasing relevance of telecouplings in the land system (<xref rid="bib0135 bib0330 bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Hostert et al., 2011; Seto et al., 2012; Meyfroidt et al., 2013</xref>). Historic studies on land use change are rare though, mainly due to a lack of data sets on land system dynamics and their underlying drivers (<xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We here present a long time series analysis of land system change in the Republic of Italy, employing the analytical framework &#x0201c;human appropriation of net primary production&#x0201d; (HANPP; <xref rid="bib0130 bib0075 bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Haberl et al., 2007; Erb et al., 2009a,b</xref>). This framework allows to comprehensively assess changes in land systems (<xref rid="bib0360 bib0130 bib0075 bib0080 bib0275" ref-type="bibr">Vitousek et al., 1997; Haberl et al., 2007; Erb et al., 2009a,b; Niedertscheider et al., 2012</xref>), by discerning changes in the extent of land-use types, which is often associated with land cover change, and changes in the intensity of land use (<xref rid="bib0205 bib0070 bib0195" ref-type="bibr">Lambin &#x00026; Meyfroidt, 2010; Erb et al., 2013; Kuemmerle et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>HANPP quantifies socio-economic biomass flows, e.g. agricultural harvest, and relates these flows consistently to ecological biomass flows, i.e. net primary production (NPP). NPP is defined as the biomass produced annually through photosynthesis. It represents the trophic basis of almost all living organisms on earth and thus is a key parameter of ecosystem functioning (<xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Roy et al., 2001</xref>). A central feature of HANPP is its ability to refer directly either to human consumption patterns, or to the impacts of land use on natural systems, allowing to put land use change in a socio-economic (e.g. resource economic; <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Alvarenga et al., 2013</xref>), as well as an ecological perspective (e.g. land use impacts on biodiversity, <xref rid="bib0055 bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Dullinger et al., 2013; Haberl et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The Republic of Italy is an interesting country for quantifying changes in biomass flows related to changing socio-economic determinants due to its unique history of repeated major political and economic shifts, encompassing a major energy transition, a shift from democracy to fascism, two world wars and the accession to the European Union. While until far into the 20th century the level of industrialization was low to moderate compared to northern European countries, Italy became one of the leading industrial players after WWII (<xref rid="bib0220 bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Malanima, 2006a,b</xref>), entailing rapid industrialization and economic growth. Thus after 1950 the role of agriculture changed completely (<xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Malanima &#x00026; Zamagni, 2010</xref>) along with structural change of the economy, technological advancement, market integration and the accession to the European Union, all of which are likely to have affected land system trajectories at different scales. Data availability allowed assessing land system changes for the Republic of Italy between 1884 and 2007.</p><p>A second interesting aspect about Italy as a study example is its pronounced North/South gradient in terms of biophysical and socio-economic conditions, which are expected to have affected land systems differently in the North compared to the South. Natural preconditions are more favourable for biomass production in the North, while the South is prone to lower annual precipitation rates (701&#x000a0;mm/year in the North versus 453&#x000a0;mm in the South in 2011, <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">ISTAT, 2012</xref>), high temperature peaks in the summer, and dry-land degradation (<xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">Zika &#x00026; Erb, 2009</xref>). In addition land use was determined by entirely different socio-economic frameworks in both regions until far into the 20th century. Historically northern land use tended to be more dominated by market driven decisions of individual family farmers who aimed at optimizing economic returns of their lands, whereas in the South land tenure rights were more restrictive particularly until WWII, with a substantial share of the population being employed as day labourers on large land holdings which were cultivated under low land use intensity (<xref rid="bib0295 bib0060 bib0265" ref-type="bibr">Rossi-Doria, 1958; Dunnage, 2002; Del Monte &#x00026; Pennacchio, 2011</xref>). As a consequence high North/South discrepancies in terms of the level of industrialization, structural change of agriculture and economic performance prevailed over the past decades and indeed have been persisting until today (<xref rid="bib0035 bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Daniele &#x00026; Malanima, 2007; ISTAT, 2013</xref>). Data availability allowed for separate HANPP and land system change calculation for North and South Italy between 1934 and 2007. In this period an ongoing process of concentration of biomass production away from marginal and poorer regions into the most fertile areas, best suited for productivity increases, has been witnessed across many European regions (<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">MacDonald et al., 2000</xref>). To our knowledge no study has so far analyzed if these processes are also reflected in the regional land use trajectories in Italy, e.g. leading to a gradual shift of harvest and HANPP from the South into the North, accompanied by a trend towards land abandonment in the South and land use intensification and production increases in the North.</p><p>Hence the overarching goals of this study are twofold: (1) We aim to analyze land system dynamics after 1884 in a consistent time-series approach and to put these trajectories in relation to long term socio-economic change, such as industrialization, market integration, and energy transition in order to scrutinize the role of these drivers in a long term perspective. (2) We will test the hypothesis if the high natural and socio-economic discrepancies between the Italian North and South led to different land system trajectories since 1934. From this analysis we expect insights into the role of climatic and socio-economic determinants for dynamics and patterns of land use in Italy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec0010"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The period studied reaches from 1884 to 2007 for the entire Italian territory and is determined by the availability of land use and agricultural harvest statistics. Italian borders have changed slightly during this period, in particular after World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII). However, in terms of the total territory, these changes were minor and were thus ignored. Between 1934 and 2007, data availability allowed analyzing land system trajectories separately for the Italian North and South. The South consists of eight provinces (Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Puglia, Abruzzo, Molise, Sicily and Sardinia) and is often referred to as &#x0201c;Mezzogiorno&#x0201d;.</p><p>Our analysis of Italian HANPP trajectories is based on a wide range of datasets, which are shortly described below. A detailed description of the materials and methods is further provided in the Supplementary Online Material (SI).</p><p>We follow the definition of HANPP by <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Haberl et al. (2007)</xref> as the sum of productivity losses due to land use and land cover change (HANPP<sub>luc</sub>) and biomass harvest (HANPP<sub>harv</sub>; <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). High HANPP levels entail lower shares of NPP<sub>eco</sub>, i.e. the share of biomass remaining in ecosystems after human land use, which is available for other food webs. Thus high HANPP indicates high pressure on ecosystems caused by human land use. NPP<sub>act</sub> refers to the current, e.g. &#x0201c;human managed&#x0201d; levels of productivity and consists of harvested NPP (HANPP<sub>harv</sub>) and remaining productivity (NPP<sub>eco</sub>).</p><p>The ratio of HANPP<sub>harv</sub> to HANPP is denoted as HANPP efficency; this metric illustrates the efficiency to which societies gain biomass resources out of their HANPP levels. High levels of HANPP efficiency imply that large fractions of the appropriated productivty directly enter the socio-economic system in the form of biomass harvest, and that smaller fractions are foregone in the course of land use. HANPP efficiency thus does not capture the level of HANPP or HANPP<sub>harv</sub> as such, but rather demonstrates the composition of HANPP.</p><p>HANPP as percentage of NPP<sub>pot</sub> represents an indicator of the degree of human dominition of ecosystems in terms of energy flows (<xref rid="bib0075 bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Erb et al., 2009a,b</xref>). Low levels imply that high fractions of the natural productivty are left in ecosystems after harvest, and that the degree of human disturbance from a HANPP perspective is generally low. HANPP per person (HANPP/cap/year) relates biomass appropriation to population numbers.</p><p>The HANPP calculation for Italy is based on the following five datasets:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="lsti0020"><label>1.</label><p><italic>A consistent land use</italic>/-<italic>land cover data set</italic>: Data for the main land use classes (i.e. forest land, grassland, annual cropland and permanent cropland) were derived from Italian national statistics (<xref rid="bib0215 bib0145 bib0150" ref-type="bibr">MAIC, 1885&#x02013;1914; ISTAT, 1935&#x02013;2008; ISTAT, 2013</xref>) and supplemented with model assumptions if data was lacking or insufficient (refer to SI text). For recent time periods, forest land in the statistics was much lower than values given in the remote-sensing derived product CORINE (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">EEA, 2006</xref>), an indication that secondary forests and other woodland has been under-reported by the statistics (<xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">Piussi &#x00026; Pettenella, 2000</xref>). In order to apply to the forest cover extent reported in CORINE 2006 (<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">EEA, 2006</xref>) we modelled secondary succession of forest land by assuming that a share of 37% of the declining agricultural areas from 1965 onwards (e.g. the year in which agricultural areas started to decline permanently) was forest land after 20 years. This share of &#x0201c;secondary forest land&#x0201d; was added to the statistical data on forest land. The category &#x0201c;other land&#x0201d; was introduced in order to account for land which was not reported by the national statistics. It was calculated as the remainder of total territory and all other land classes. A comparison with CORINE data revealed that &#x0201c;other land&#x0201d; includes a mixture of various land categories which are not reported in the national statistics, e.g. &#x0201c;heterogeneous agricultural land&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;shrublands&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;emerging forest land&#x0201d;. For annual croplands CORINE reported higher values than the national statistics in the year 2006 (84&#x000a0;000 vs. 70&#x000a0;000&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>). However, we believe that in terms of cultivated land national statistics are reliable and offer a consistent data basis over the entire time period observed.</p></list-item><list-item id="lsti0025"><label>2.</label><p>Data on biomass harvest (HANPP<sub>harv</sub>) was taken from the national statistics (<xref rid="bib0215 bib0145 bib0150" ref-type="bibr">MAIC, 1885&#x02013;1914; ISTAT, 1935&#x02013;2008; ISTAT, 2013</xref>) and from the literature (e.g. for fuelwood consumption see <xref rid="bib0220 bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Malanima, 2006a,b</xref>).

In terms of land use/-cover (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a), two contrasting trends can be observed: Whereas the period before WWII was characterized by an expansion of cropland, mostly at the expense of grazing land, after WWII, agricultural areas decreased considerably, allowing for the regrowth of forests (increase from 18% to 26% between 1884 and 2007). Settlement areas increased along with population rise, contributing a share of less than 5% to the territory over time. Unused areas amounted around 5% to total territory extent.

HANPP<sub>harv</sub> on permanent cropland and on settlement areas played a minor role, increasing steadily from 1884 to 2007 (increase by 62% and 178%, respectively). HANPP<sub>harv</sub> on forest land was dominated by the extraction of fuelwood (not shown here) and more or less stagnated over the observed time span.</p><p>Italian HANPP trends reveal the significance of agricultural land (the sum of cropland and grazing land) as the dominating drivers of the aggregated trends (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c).

While annual cropland and grazing land still contributed around 53% and 24%, to total HANPP in 1938, the shares decreased to 39% and 17%, respectively, by 2007. This decrease was largely compensated by HANPP on permanent croplands and forest land. HANPP on forest land remained constant over the entire time period, fluctuating around a level of 7&#x000a0;Mio&#x000a0;tC/year. HANPP on settlement areas and on &#x02018;other land&#x02019; contributed only minor shares to the overall HANPP trajectories.

The decline was less pronounced in the South, where the level was also lower (by around 46% on average) over the entire time period observed.

Until WWII agricultural growth in terms of economic output was low (<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Federico &#x00026; Malanima, 2004</xref>), although it still played a central role in the economy (<xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Malanima &#x00026; Zamagni, 2010</xref>). A rapid industrial transition and fast economic growth started only after WWII, allowing for massive surges in agricultural productivity within a few years, accompanied with a concentration of land use on the most productive areas (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Falcucci et al., 2006</xref>). Abandonment of cultivated land was in particular pronounced in the mountainous regions (<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Falcucci et al., 2006</xref>), leading to a forest transition (<xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">Mather, 2001</xref>) and declining HANPP levels until the end of the observed period. In the period before WWII, HANPP was stagnating at around 80% of NPP<sub>pot</sub>, surpassed the 80% between 1955 and 1970, and declined to a level below 60% in 2007. HANPP in Italy is thus at or above the HANPP level in many other industrialized countries, e.g. the UK, Spain, Hungary, or the Czech Republic (<xref rid="bib0170 bib0325 bib0270 bib0355" ref-type="bibr">Krausmann et al., 2001; Kohlheb &#x00026; Krausmann, 2009; Schwarzlmuller, 2009; Musel, 2009; Va&#x0010d;k&#x000e1;&#x00159; &#x00026; Orlitov&#x000e1;, 2011</xref>; refer also to <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Krausmann et al., 2012</xref>). Italian HANPP was chiefly dominated by the trajectories on cropland throughout time, and to a somewhat lesser extent by HANPP on grazing land. Yield increases on cropland allowed for a decoupling of levels of HANPP<sub>harv</sub> and cropland extent. Due to returning forests on abandoned croplands, HANPP<sub>luc</sub> increased, which translated into declining HANPP levels particularly after WWII. In per capita terms, HANPP showed a steep decline by a factor 2 from 1884 to 2007. Simultaneously HANPP efficiency increased (rising HANPP<sub>harv</sub> per unit of HANPP), while croplands contracted and HANPP<sub>harv</sub> increased. Thus land system change in Italy followed the typical trend of industrialization of the land-use system in overall terms (<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Krausmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>By 1884 the Italian energy system was still primarily based on biomass as the main supplier of energy and labour (<xref rid="bib0220 bib0225 bib0115" ref-type="bibr">Malanima, 2006a,b; Gales et al., 2007</xref>). Rural poverty was high and natural resources (e.g. coal) including land for biomass production were chronically scarce. Concurrently outputs per land area, e.g. cereal yields, were generally below European average (<xref rid="bib0015 bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Baade, 1952; Malanima, 2011</xref>), highlighting the low level of agricultural intensification, e.g. in terms of Nitrogen use compared to other European regions, which were already in the middle of industrial transition (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Baade, 1952</xref>). Agriculture was still primarily subsistence based, (except for wheat production, see <xref rid="bib0090 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Federico, 2007a,b</xref>) and market integration was generally low, particularly in the Southern provinces. This is reflected in the low levels of HANPP efficiency until 1890 (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d, dashed line), which is a result of low yields and large productivity losses (HANPP<sub>luc</sub>). This changed to some degree in the period preceding WWI, when HANPP efficiency started to increase, fuelled by surging actual productivity on cultivated land.</p><p>The fascist period, from 1922 until WWII, was marked by the paradigm of agricultural self-sufficiency (<xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt, 1936</xref>). Land policies promoted land reclamation programmes, milestones were e.g. the drainage of the Pontine marshes (<xref rid="bib0165 bib0315" ref-type="bibr">Kish, 1966; Schmidt, 1937</xref>). However, according to the aggregate national picture cropland extent remained at a constant level in these years and contrary to what was desired by the fascist regime HANPP<sub>harv</sub> increased only minor. Likewise HANPP as percentage of NPP<sub>pot</sub> remained at a constant level in this period and HANPP efficiency even slightly declined, indicating no major advancements in agricultural technology, which otherwise would have led to increasing HANPP efficiency as a result of rising yields.</p><p>The land systems changed drastically after WWII, following pathways of rising land use intensity. In the 1950s and 1960s Italy's economy underwent a rapid transition towards a fossil based energy system (<xref rid="bib0220 bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Malanima, 2006a,b</xref>) and gradually became one of the leading industrial players in Europe. As a consequence the role of agriculture changed fundamentally in these years. By 1970 the share of Italians employed in agriculture had shrunk from 60% in 1884 to 17% of the total work force (<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Daniele &#x00026; Malanima, 2009</xref>) and the agricultural share to total GDP has shrunk to less than 10% (<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">ISTAT, 2013</xref>). Thus economic performance as well as energy supply were no longer depending on land use performance. Simultaneously access to artificial fertilizers and agricultural machinery was improving drastically in the post-war years (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>g and h), allowing for surging agricultural yields (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>e). Thus actual productivity on annual cropland increased at fast pace, as a result of increasing land use intensification. Surges in nitrogen inputs were even more drastic than increases of cropland harvest, leading to declining levels of Nitrogen productivity between 1950 and 2007 (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>k).</p><p>In turn agriculture on remote and mountainous land became less profitable, gradually leading to abandonment of agriculture and to a polarization of biomass production (<xref rid="bib0125 bib0005 bib0210 bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Guidi &#x00026; Piussi, 1993; Alberti et al., 2011; MacDonald et al., 2000; Caraveli, 2000</xref>). This led to a declining HANPP trend and increasing HANPP efficiency, which started in the mid-1960s and continued until the end of the period.</p><p>The decline of agricultural areas after WWII was particularly pronounced in Italy, because Italy holds a substantial share of mountainous land, which made adoption of new technologies (e.g. heavy machinery) difficult. Structural economic change increased the availability of more profitable income sources than agriculture provided, emphasizing urbanization (<xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">Malanima, 2005</xref>) and further land abandonment. In turn this allowed for re-growing forest land particularly from the 1960s onwards (<xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">Piussi &#x00026; Pettenella, 2000</xref>) and indeed the Italian forest transition was rather rapid in terms of area expansion and growing forest stock, also compared to other European countries (see <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Kauppi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>These trends continued to dominate land system trajectories until the mid-1980s, when growth of HANPP<sub>harv</sub> in absolute terms and per m<sup>2</sup> of land started to stagnate, and the increase in HANPP efficiency came to a halt. Particularly pronounced are reductions in the amount of grazed biomass, which is attributed to declining animal stocks and intensification of the livestock system (also refer to <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>f), characterized by an increasing importance of market feed as a source of animal fodder and growing independency from grasslands. EU-policies, which were formerly production based, and thus favoured a shift towards high intensity farming started to promote more extensive forms of agriculture by the late 1980s and particularly in the early 1990s (<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Caraveli, 2000</xref>). However, actual productivity per land unit in overall terms continued to rise as a result of further expansion of forests, characterized by high NPP<sub>act</sub> values, on abandoned land (<xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a and b), and increasing yields on croplands, particularly in the North (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>e).</p><p>These improvements in terms of HANPP, however, cannot be straightforwardly interpreted as a development towards more sustainable land systems from a global perspective. HANPP accounts only focus on developments on a defined territory unit, but do not allow to depict trajectories in resource use of a population. Analyzing Italian net biomass trade (Fig. 1, SI) reveals that declining levels of HANPP from 1884 to 2007 have been offset by imports: Net imports of biomass increased more than 10-fold from 1934 to 2007, illustrating that land use impacts were increasingly externalized to other world regions. This is a much faster growth than the increase in population numbers, which increased 1.5-fold in the same time period (<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">ISTAT, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec0040"><title>North/South land system trajectories</title><p>The analysis of land system change in the North and South of Italy revealed striking similarities between the regional pictures. Most prominently, HANPP trajectories, either in relation to natural productivity or to population growth (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a and b), are remarkably similar, both in level and trend. HANPP in both regions declined from around 80% to a value of somewhat below 60% of NPP<sub>pot</sub> from 1934 to 2007. This indicates that, despite all the differences in natural endowment and socio-economic performance, a similar pressure on ecosystems is exerted by land use in both regions. Additionally, this pressure was decoupled at an almost identical pace from population growth in each region.</p><p>Also the general pattern of land use/-cover change is similar for the North and South of Italy, most notably encompassing a concentration of agriculture on the most fertile areas over time, in favour of forest re-growth. Biomass production was rising in both regions, as well as NPP<sub>act</sub> per m<sup>2</sup> and HANPP efficiency (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c, j, d and e). Likewise both regions were marked by slight decreases of HANPP<sub>harv</sub> per m<sup>2</sup> by the late 1980s, indicating similar responses to a shift in EU-land policies, which started to subsidize set aside programmes and more extensive forms of agriculture in these years. This is also reflected in declining growth rates of Nitrogen inputs (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>g).</p><p>Although the trends in overall patterns of land system change were similar, absolute and relative levels of several indicators differed between both regions. In the North, volumes of HANPP<sub>harv</sub> were much larger (116&#x000a0;gC/m<sup>2</sup> compared to 98&#x000a0;gC/m<sup>2</sup>/year in the South in 2007), and productivity losses as the second part of HANPP were smaller over the entire time period considered. Here NPP<sub>act</sub> levels even surpassed their natural potential (NPP<sub>pot</sub>) on annual croplands from the late 1980s onwards, as it is indicated by negative values of HANPP<sub>luc</sub> (not shown here), while Southern NPP<sub>act</sub> remained well below its natural potential. Level differences of NPP<sub>act</sub> in the Italian North and South can be attributed to the combined effects of contrasting biophysical conditions and effects of socio-economic legacies. Over the previous decades and centuries both regions developed distinct ways of land use for biomass production. Although a mix of different land- and agricultural systems co-existed in both regions at various times, the Southern biomass production system was characterized by very high rural poverty (and still is, see <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Bertolini et al., 2008</xref>), lacking agricultural investment, and restrictive land tenure rights (e.g. high share of landless day labourers) far into the second half of the 20th century. This led to the emergence of extensive, low input forms of agriculture over large parts in the South, while the share of highly productive areas (olive, fruit and wine cultivation), was restricted mainly to some coastal zones (<xref rid="bib0295 bib0060 bib0265" ref-type="bibr">Rossi-Doria, 1958; Dunnage, 2002; Del Monte &#x00026; Pennacchio, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the North, land tenure rights improved in the 19th century and agriculture became more closely connected to industry which granted access to capital inputs such as Nitrogen and machinery. This led to a tendency towards a more intensive and more profitable biomass production system than it was the case in the South (<xref rid="bib0060 bib0265" ref-type="bibr">Dunnage, 2002; Del Monte &#x00026; Pennacchio, 2011</xref>). Particularly the Po valley has been one of the most advanced agricultural regions in Europe already in the 19th century. Here large scale land reclamation schemes and irrigation systems have been introduced much earlier than in the Southern regions (<xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">Schmidt, 1937</xref>).</p><p>In Southern Italy, large land holders did not follow this intensification trend, and relied much more on a traditional workforce organization, which may partly explain the level differences of some HANPP indicators. Even after WWII, when Southern agro-economic development was made a national issue (an example is the foundation of the national programme &#x0201c;cassa per il Mezzogiorno&#x0201d;, aimed primarily at financing public construction works, and promoting economic investment) and land tenure rights were completely reformed in the course of a major land reform (<xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">Rother et al., 2000</xref>), the economic gap has been described to even have widened (<xref rid="bib0105 bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Felice, 2009; Daniele &#x00026; Malanima, 2007</xref>). This is also supported by the results of HANPP<sub>harv</sub> on cropland and agricultural labour productivity after WWII, revealing faster acceleration of the trends in the North (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>e, i and l).</p><p>There are many views of why the North performed better in terms of (agro-) economic productivity than the South. One view is that climate, soils and topography made investment into the land more risky in the South, where land owners had to deal with hot growing seasons, repeating drought events and harvest failures (Petruscewitz cited in <xref rid="bib0090 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Federico, 2007a,b</xref>). Basically, the South faces a larger precipitation deficit than the North which is mirrored both in the LPJ-model outputs (NPP<sub>pot</sub> was 25% lower in the South than in the North, refer to Fig. 2, SI) and actual productivity. In addition, human induced soil degradation is a problem particularly for the South (<xref rid="bib0310 bib0260 bib0290" ref-type="bibr">Salvati &#x00026; Zitti, 2009; Montanarella, 2007; Rendell, 1986</xref>).</p><p>Differences in biophysical conditions also influence decisions on plant species grown and cropping techniques applied, which might explain the differences in the level of many HANPP variables (NPP<sub>act</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>, HANPP<sub>harv</sub>/m<sup>2</sup>, cropland HANPP<sub>harv</sub>/m<sup>2</sup> and HANPP efficiency) to some extent. For instance, permanent cropland in the South contributed a higher share to total land cover than in the North. Permanent cropland, as a relatively extensive form of agriculture, naturally exhibits lower levels of HANPP<sub>harv</sub> per unit of land. Still permanent cropland can be highly profitable in monetary terms, and these examples also existed in the South (Rossi Doria cited in <xref rid="bib0090 bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Federico, 2007a,b</xref>).</p><p>Nevertheless, the bio-climatically disadvantageous situation of the South did not lead to a reduced HANPP per capita compared to the North. Interestingly North/South disparities in land use trends seem to play out particularly on the socio-economic dimension of HANPP. Namely NPP<sub>act</sub> as well as HANPP<sub>harv</sub> per land area and HANPP efficiency (HANPP<sub>harv</sub> as % of HANPP) (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> c, d, e and j) were at higher levels in the North throughout the entire time period observed (despite revealing similar trends). However, high levels of fertilizer and machinery use were necessary in the North to achieve such high productivity levels (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>g and h), whereas levels of external inputs were lower in the South. This implies that environmental pressures related to high land use intensity, which are not quantified in the HANPP framework (e.g. air-, groundwater and soil pollution), are probably more severe in the North.</p><p>On the other hand almost no differences remain when the difference in potential productivity are taken into account. HANPP expressed in percent of NPP<sub>pot</sub> is nearly identical in both regions, indicating a very similar degree of human disturbance or level of land use related pressures on ecosystems. The same was true for other land system parameters, such as HANPP per capita, or Nitrogen use productivity, which indicates that one unit of HANPP<sub>harv</sub> consumed similar amounts of Nitrogen (<xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>c, d, e and j).</p><p>Our study revealed that, contrary to what we have expected, the differences in socio-economic frameworks and natural preconditions for land use did not translate into major differences in the land system trajectories. Given the wide-spread notion of a low productive and backward Italian South in contrast to a highly productive Italian North, similarities in the overall patterns of land system change observed in this study were rather surprising. This is particularly true in the light of previous findings at the national scale, for instance Spain (<xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">Schwarzlmuller, 2009</xref>) and Great Britain (<xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">Musel, 2009</xref>; see <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Krausmann et al., 2012</xref>) where considerable differences in terms of the levels of HANPP % NPP<sub>pot</sub> between Northern and Southern countries are found. This indicates that, related to the development of land use over time, the common history of political developments and land use policies were apparently strong enough to compensate for the regional differences and particularities between the North and South.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec0045"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Industrialization and intensification of land use were the common determinants of land use change in Italy, with gradually decreasing significance of biomass production for the overall economic performance being at the heart of the post WWII land use trends. The similarity in trends and &#x02013; to a lesser degree &#x02013; also in levels between Italian's North and South suggests that strong drivers of land system change must have been overruling the harsh differences in biophysical and socio-economic framework conditions between the two regions. The intensification of land use was a &#x0201c;mega-driver&#x0201d; of land system change in both regions: increasing levels of fertilizer use and machinery employment, lead to similar trends towards land abandonment and forest transition. In addition, the structural economic change, which led to a decreasing significance of land-based production in terms of economic performance and growth, was overruling any regional socio-economic as well as biophysical particularity. This megatrend was prevailing in both regions at a surprising similarity.</p><p>Further analyses of the interplay between socio-economic and natural determinants of land system change are required to scrutinize the underlying mechanisms and dominant processes characterizing this megatrend. The HANPP perspective on the case of Italy illustrates that caveats are warranted towards oversimplified hypotheses on mechanisms and determinants of land-system trajectories. Integrated, consistent and comprehensive frameworks are required to deepen our understanding of the complexities related to trajectories of land use change, in order to provide the knowledge base for future, more sustainable land systems.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alberti</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Impact of woody encroachment on soil organic carbon and nitrogen in abandoned agricultural lands along a rainfall gradient in Italy</article-title><source>Regional Environmental Change</source><volume>11</volume><issue>4</issue><year>2011</year><fpage>917</fpage><lpage>924</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alvarenga</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Exergy-based accounting for land as a natural resource in life cycle assessment</article-title><source>The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment</source><year>2013</year><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0015"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baade</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Brot f&#x000fc;r ganz Europa, Parey</chapter-title><year>1952</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0020"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bertolini</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Poverty and Social Exclusion in Rural Areas</chapter-title><year>2008</year><fpage>197</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0025"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0025"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bruinsma</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>World Agriculture: Towards 2015/2030: An FAO Perspective</chapter-title><year>2003</year><publisher-name>Earthscan/James &#x00026; James</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0030"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0030"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Caraveli</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A comparative analysis on intensification and extensification in Mediterranean agriculture: dilemmas for LFAs policy</article-title><source>Journal of Rural Studies</source><volume>16</volume><issue>2</issue><year>2000</year><fpage>231</fpage><lpage>242</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0035"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0035"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Daniele</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Malanima</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Il prodotto delle regioni e il divario Nord-Sud in Italia (1861&#x02013;2004)</article-title><source>Rivista di politica economica</source><volume>97</volume><issue>2</issue><year>2007</year><fpage>267</fpage><lpage>316</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0040"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sbref0040"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Daniele</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name><name><surname>Malanima</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Labour Supply in Italy 1861&#x02013;2001.
