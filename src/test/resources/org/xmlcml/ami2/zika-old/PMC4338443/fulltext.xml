Case fatality rates in severe cases can exceed 50%. Estimates by WHO indicate that the true number of cases is close to 250 times the reported cases[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] because mild cases can go undetected as the signs and symptoms of YF are similar to those of viral hepatitis, malaria, leptospirosis, typhus, Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers.</p><p>In a 10 country yellow-fever protection test survey conducted in Central and East Africa between 1937 and 1943, it was demonstrated that YF had occurred in Zambia, then Northern Rhodesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Robinson[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported that over 7% of more than 3000 blood samples from the population of the Balovale district in Kaonde-Lunda province now called North-Western province yielded positive results in protection tests. Many locations in the western part of Zambia in the Zambesi River basin were surveyed again in 1951-53; neutralizing antibodies were detected with a sero-prevalence up to 18%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Western province, then Barotse Province and Balovale were included in the African endemic YF area. Zambia's potential for YF transmission is unclear. In 2010, North-Western and Western provinces of Zambia were designated as YF low-risk regions by a WHO Yellow Fever Technical Working Group[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] despite the fact that YF sero-prevalence studies were conducted six decades ago. In order to provide a more up-to-date sero-survey data, including results from tests for multiple flaviviruses, that will assist the WHO Yellow Fever Technical Working Group to confirm or refute the classification for Zambia, a study was conducted to determine the potential risk of YF infection in Western and North-Western provinces of Zambia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study site</title><p>The study was conducted in Western and North-Western provinces of Zambia. Western province with a population of 902,974 borders with Angola and had seven districts which were divided into 1902 SEAs.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It is the driest area of Zambia and located at 1119 m above sea level and latitude -15.0 and longitude 24.0.

Any individual aged 9 months or older and who was a member of a sampled household and resident in the study site for at least seven days was eligible to participate in the survey.

Determining the sero-prevalence in children under the age of 9 months raises the risk of false positive results as children under this age may still carry maternal antibodies from immunized or exposed mothers.

The total number of persons aged 5 years or older that would be recruited from each province was 1400.</p><p>The sero-prevalence of children aged less than 5 years was about half that for older children, and in estimating the sample size for persons aged below 5 years, the following parameters were considered: A prevalence of 3.5%, desired precision or confidence interval (d) of &#x000b1;3.4%, and a design effect (DE) of 2 and an 80% response rate. A total of 406 children aged below 5 years would be recruited for the survey.</p><p>The sample was drawn using a two-stage cluster sampling technique using probability proportional to size. A list of the standard enumeration areas (SEAs) in each province constituted the sampling frame. The line lists of the SEAs were provided by the Zambian Government's Central Statistics Office (CSO).

All the cases of YF were adults aged 20 years or older. The YF virus was currently circulating.</p><p>The observed prevalence in the current study is far less than what was observed in 1943 of 7%in the then Balovale area that includes the present Western and North-western province[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and 18% in 1951-1953,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] indicating 95.7% or 98.3% decline in sero-prevalence, respectively. The difference in the rates may partly be due to differences in method of laboratory analysis of samples collected, the stages of the epidemic and due to malaria vector control efforts. Because recent infections were observed in the current study, the two provinces may be in the early stages of the YF epidemic. It is not clear at what stage of the epidemic the Balovale area was.</p><p>While in the current study all cases of YF were of persons aged between 20 and 77 years, cases in a study conducted in Senegal 2002 cases were aged 3 to 38 years and no case was aged 40 years or older.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Children are more affected than adults because adults acquire natural immunity in a YF endemic area. The difference in the age distribution of the cases between the studies may partly be explained by the fact that YF was endemic in Senegal and potentially epidemic in the current study.</p><p>Previous studies have documented the presence of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (L), <italic>Ae. simpsoni</italic> (Theo.) and <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> (Newst.) and <italic>Ae. Africanus</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The control of these mosquitoes in Zambia include indoor residual spraying (IRS) and use of insecticide treated Nets (ITNs). The coverages of IRS as well of ITNs have increased nationwide. For example, the coverage of at least one ITN or recent IRS has increased from 43%in 2006 to 74% in 2012.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] High coverage rates may reduce human-vector contacts, and hence reduce the risk to viral infection. However, the coverage rate for IRS of 27.6% in North-western province and 14.3% in Western province; and that for ITNs of 56.9% in North-western province and 61.1% in Western province were lower than the national figures.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The strength of the study lies in its large sample size. The samples were drawn using a two-stage cluster sampling technique using probability proportional to size and, hence, the samples are representative of the provinces. Although recall bias may have been introduced in our study, we are not able to determine its magnitude and direction. However, we believed that bias was minimum and that our findings may not have been significantly affected.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There is evidence of past and recent infection of YF in both provinces. Furthermore, the provinces border with areas where YF is endemic or transitional. Based on the classification of risk of transmission of YF virus by Jentes <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] the two provinces are at a low risk for YF infection. YF vaccination should be included in the EPI program in the two provinces. There is a need to strengthen the integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) in both provinces, given that diseases such as YF and other flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile and Zika) were not reported. Periodic follow-up risk assessment may be useful to document the risk in future complemented by strong surveillance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We acknowledge the laboratory support received from the Virology Laboratory at University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia and from the Institute de Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.
