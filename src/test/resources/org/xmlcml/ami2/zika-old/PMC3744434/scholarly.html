            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Arthropod-borne viruses are important emerging pathogens world-wide. Viruses transmitted
               by mosquitoes, such as dengue, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, infect
               hundreds of millions of people and animals each year. Global surveillance of these
               viruses in mosquito vectors using molecular based assays is critical for prevention
               and control of the associated diseases. Here, we report an oligonucleotide DNA microarray
               design, termed ArboChip5.1, for multi-gene detection and identification of mosquito-borne
               RNA viruses from the genera 
               <i>Flavivirus</i> (family 
               <i>Flaviviridae</i>), 
               <i>Alphavirus</i> (
               <i>Togaviridae</i>), 
               <i>Orthobunyavirus</i> (
               <i>Bunyaviridae</i>), and 
               <i>Phlebovirus</i> (
               <i>Bunyaviridae</i>).

            <h2>Methodology/Principal Findings</h2>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The assay utilizes targeted PCR amplification of three genes from each virus genus
               for electrochemical detection on a portable, field-tested microarray platform. Fifty-two
               viruses propagated in cell-culture were used to evaluate the specificity of the PCR
               primer sets and the ArboChip5.1 microarray capture probes. The microarray detected
               all of the tested viruses and differentiated between many closely related viruses
               such as members of the dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and Semliki Forest virus clades.
               Laboratory infected mosquitoes were used to simulate field samples and to determine
               the limits of detection. Additionally, we identified dengue virus type 3, Japanese
               encephalitis virus, Tembusu virus, 
               <i>Culex</i> flavivirus, and a Quang Binh-like virus from mosquitoes collected in Thailand in
               2011 and 2012.

            <h2>Conclusions/Significance</h2>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We demonstrated that the described assay can be utilized in a comprehensive field
               surveillance program by the broad-range amplification and specific identification
               of arboviruses from infected mosquitoes. Furthermore, the microarray platform can
               be deployed in the field and viral RNA extraction to data analysis can occur in as
               little as 12 h. The information derived from the ArboChip5.1 microarray can help to
               establish public health priorities, detect disease outbreaks, and evaluate control
               programs.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Approximately half of the world's population is at risk of viral, mosquito-borne illness
            such as dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, and chikungunya.
            In the past, these viruses have been regarded as pathogens of the tropics; however,
            they are emerging as global causes of illness. Very few effective drugs and vaccines
            have been developed for mosquito-borne viral infections and even less are available
            to people in resource-limited countries. An important aspect of disease prevention
            is mosquito surveillance to determine geographical range and seasonal prevalence of
            the associated viruses. However, there are hundreds of viruses transmitted by mosquitoes
            that are pathogenic to humans and animals. Using a portable microarray, we developed
            an assay with the ability to detect most of the known medically important viruses
            transmitted by mosquitoes. This assay was designed for use in conjunction with broad-range
            screening tools as a cost effective, rapid method to determine the identity of viruses
            from infected mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive assay to
            date for field surveillance of mosquito-borne viruses.

            that are biologically transmitted to vertebrates by hematophagous (blood feeding)
            arthropod vectors, such as female mosquitoes. The diverse group of mosquito-borne
            RNA viruses primarily includes flaviviruses (
            <i>Flaviviridae</i>: 
            <i>Flavivirus</i>), alphaviruses (
            <i>Togaviridae</i>:

            in clinical samples. However, none of the assays have been designed or analyzed for
            use with infected mosquitoes. Most of the assays included an unbiased, random amplification

            are efficient for the amplification viral nucleic acids isolated from cultured cells,

               (unpublished data). Due to a lack of sequence information at the time of probe design,
               probes for all three gene targets were not included for some viruses. Probes targeting
               viruses not tested in this publication should be considered investigational until

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The virus-targeted capture probes were sorted into 12 groups, three groups for each
               genus based on the gene target. Each group was further sorted into subgroups based
               on the virus clade and probe specificity. For example, a probe specific for the DENV-3
               NS5 gene would be in the 
               <i>Flavivirus</i> NS5 group and the DENV clade, DENV-3 subgroup (DENV_DENV3). Probes that hybridized
               to multiple, but related viruses were classified as non-virus-specific and sorted
               into genus (i.e. flavivirus_generic) or clade-specific (i.e. DENV_clade) subgroups.
               Some very closely related viruses, such as O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) and Igbo Ora
               virus (IOV) of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) clade, could not be differentiated.
               Probes for virus targets that could not be differentiated were sorted into subgroups
               containing virus complexes (i.e. SFV_ONNV/IOV).

               Fifty-two virus strains from 46 different species were evaluated for PCR amplification
               and probe specificity, representing 46/144 (32%) of the total targeted viruses. Each
               microarray probe was evaluated for specificity to its intended target(s). Some PCR
               amplicons cross-hybridized to non-predicted probes (i.e. probes specific for a different
               virus or group of viruses); however, in each case there was no more than one such
               probe per subgroup and the average z-scores were never greater than 10. No probes
               cross-hybridized with viruses from a different genus.

                     ECD signals were converted into z-scores. Subgroups with average z-scores greater
                     than 10 were considered positive and used for virus identification. The plotted maximum
                     z-scores represent the greatest individual probe z-score within a subgroup and were
                     used to determine cross-hybridization. The PCR amplicons hybridized with probes in
                     the 
                     <i>Flavivirus</i> generic, JEV clade, WNVL1/KUNV, and WNVL1 subgroups for all three gene targets. WNVL1

               in cell culture, with the following exceptions. The PCR bands for DENV-4 infected
               
               <i>Ae. albopictus</i> were faint but they were still accurately identified by all three genes on the microarray.
               The E gene was not PCR amplified from either stain of TMUV infected 
               <i>Culex tarsalis</i> and could not be detected on the microarray. To mimic field samples, single mosquitoes
               infected with DENV-1, TMUV, and WNVL1 were pooled with 24 negative mosquitoes. Compared
               to single infected mosquitoes, the identification results were the same but had overall
               lower z-scores. A WNVL1-infected and a JEV-infected 
               <i>Cx. pipiens</i> were pooled with 23 negative mosquitoes to assess the amplification and detection
               of two distinct viruses that could be found in a field collected pool of mosquitoes.
               All three gene targets were amplified using the flavivirus GSP sets but the E genes
               of JEV and WNVL1 and the NS5 gene of WNVL1 were not detected using the microarray.
               Three of the five JEV-specific NS5 gene probes had z-scores greater than 10, but the
               average z-score for the subgroup was less than 10 (9.13). However, all of the JEV-
               and WNVL1-specific (out of 5 and 8, respectively) and two of the four WNVL1/KUNV NS3
               probes had z-scores greater than 10 (
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002349.s002">Figure S1</span>). The JEV-specific probes and the WNVL1-specific probes did not hybridize to NS3
               amplicons from the other virus when evaluated individually; therefore this is an example
               of microarray detecting the RNA from two related but distinct flaviviruses in the
               same mosquito pool.

               the two major orthobunyavirus groups, the BUNV and California encephalitis virus (CEV)
               serogroups. Due to a lack of whole genome sequence information publically available

               (OROV) and Tahyna virus (TAHV) were the only viruses evaluated that had virus-specific
               probes designed for all three genome segments. Seven of the 12 (58%) orthobunyaviruses
               were PCR amplified with three GSP sets. The microarray only detected all three segments
               from La Crosse virus (LACV); however, the M segment was only identified as belonging
               to the CEV clade (no M segment specific probes for LACV due to cross-reactivity with
               other CEV clade viruses). All of the orthobunyavirus tested were PCR amplified, detected,
               and identified to virus species by at least one target, except for Maguari virus,
               which was not detected by the microarray due to a lack of PCR amplification of the
               S and M segments and a lack of virus specific probes for the L segment. Multiple strains
               of BUNV were used to evaluate microarray identification of virus targets with slight
               nucleotide differences. The 10 different orthobunyavirus species evaluated represents

               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0002349.s001">Dataset S1</span>. Nine of the 13 pools were correctly identified by at least one gene targeted by
               the microarray. RNA sequences related to QBV were found in three pools not identified
               by the microarray. The other pool not identified by the microarray contained RNA related
               to Wang Thong virus, a virus not included in the ArboChip5.1 design due to a lack
               of sequence information in the targeted gene regions. The results were verified by
               virus isolation and sequencing of the PCR amplicons. Pool number Th9-0032 was identified
               in the field as QBV, but partial sequencing of the NS5 gene showed that while QBV
               was its closest match, it was only 78.3% identical. There was less than a 70 bp overlap
               between the targeted NS5 region that identified Th9-0032 as QBV and the partial sequence.
               Further analysis on the other genes will need to be completed to determine the identity
               of the QBV-like virus.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The ArboChip5.1 consists of 2,097 oligonucleotide probes targeting 144 different mosquito-borne
            RNA viruses across the genera 
            <i>Flavivirus</i>, 
            <i>Alphavirus</i>, 
            <i>Orthobunyavirus</i>, and 
            <i>Phlebovirus</i>. For most of the selected viruses, capture probes were designed to multiple genes
            to increase the odds of detection, identification, and confirmation. The assay also
            utilized consensus GSPs for broad-range PCR amplification of viral RNA, even in the
            presence of an abundance amount of mosquito nucleic acids. The microarray platform
            described here, and as we previously discussed, is portable and rugged enough to endure
            travel and field conditions

            </span>. The microarray was able to identify viral RNA extracted from cell culture, laboratory-infected
            mosquitoes, and field-collected mosquitoes, thus making it versatile and practical.
            To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive microarray assay specifically designed
            for arbovirus surveillance in mosquito vectors.

            was utilized to produce a higher ratio of reverse compliment amplicons to hybridize
            with the microarray probes. In addition, biotinylation of the amplicons was incorporated
            into the PCR to improve the assay efficiency and ease of use. In a previous study,
            we evaluated using direct detection of viral RNA without amplification, random primed
            PCR amplification, and gene-specific PCR amplification and determined that gene-specific
            PCR amplification was needed for microarray detection of flavivirus RNA in infected
            mosquitoes

            detection (data not shown); therefore, the reactions were performed individually with
            each GSP set. For a given virus genus, the amplified gene targets were pooled after
            PCR to reduce the number of microarrays to be tested. Though some level of variability
            was observed, the outcomes of the microarrays were found to be reproducible. However,
            the microarray chips have been found to fail on occasion if they were not stored or
            stripped properly.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The limiting factors for creating the viral diagnostic DNA microarray presented here
            were the availability of viral sequences present in publically available databases
            and the sequence diversity in the targeted nucleotide regions. Flaviviruses and alphaviruses
            are generally well characterized, and their entire genomic sequences are available
            for most known species. As a result, unique probes targeting all three genes of diagnostic
            interest for most flaviviruses and alphaviruses were created. We were able to detect
            and identify all of the flaviviruses and alphaviruses tested from both cell culture
            and infected mosquitoes, except for a few closely related alphaviruses as discussed
            below. Closely related flaviviruses, such as the four serotypes of DENV and WNVL1,
            WNVL2, and KUNV were clearly differentiated using the microarray. Additionally, JEV
            and WNVL1, both JEV clade flaviviruses, were detected from a pool of laboratory infected
            mosquitoes, showcasing the ability of the microarray to differentiate between closely
            related viruses that might be found in the same mosquito pool. Though we were able
            to differentiate between many closely related alphaviruses, we were not able to differentiate
            between SINV, OCKV, and BBKV and between ONNV and IOV. This was because there was
            not enough sequence diversity between the listed alphaviruses in the targeted nucleotide
            regions to create probes that would not cross-hybridize using the described assay
            conditions. Instead, the viruses were identified as either part of the SINV or ONNV
            clades and other data, such as the mosquito species and collection location, could
            be used to distinguish the specific alphavirus.

            information was available, virus-specific probes could not be designed for all of

            </span>. Viral RNA positive mosquito pools would then be PCR amplified using the GSPs for
            the genus (or genera) of interest and analyzed using the microarray platform. These
            PCR assays should not be used alone for screening mosquito pools for arbovirus RNA
            because 1) asymmetric PCR amplification can reduce sensitivity, 2) biotin would be
            wasted on many negative pools, increasing the costs of surveillance and 3) the degenerate
            GSP sets were designed to increase assay sensitivity, but at the cost of specificity,
            meaning additional non-specific bands are produced which can confound interpretation
            of the results. The microarray assay could be used to analyze viral RNA isolated from
            animal tissue or serum, or from sand flies, because many phleboviruses are included
            in the design. However, viral RNA isolated from these sources has not been evaluated
            using the microarray and associated methods.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Multiplexed-PCR methods for viral RNA identification can be efficient for a small
            sub-set of viruses, yet when there is a need to discern between a larger set of mosquito-borne
            viruses, PCR approaches for virus identification can become laborious. The microarray,
            as described here, is a time and cost effective method for the detection of numerous
            viral RNA species potentially present within an infected mosquito with limited bias.
            Each ElectraSense 4×2K microarray has four wells to analyze four samples at a time,
            and when using the rotisserie hybridization incubator described here, holding four
            microarray chips at a time, up to 16 samples can be processed in as little as 12 hours.
            The major limitations of this assay are that only known viral sequences can be used
            for probe design, meaning that it cannot identify novel viruses, and it cannot discern
            between slight nucleotide changes, meaning that it cannot anticipate viral evolution.
            Even though previously unknown or non-targeted viral RNA maybe detected because of
            some sequence homology in one of the targeted regions, the microarray would not be
            able to identify novel viruses. On the other hand, next-generation sequencing (NGS)
            has the potential to provide the most amount of nucleic acid information, but they
            are not portable and require more time and labor to create sequencing libraries and
            analyze the results. Moreover, NGS systems are much more expensive to operate, generally
            costing over $1000 per run

            </span>. To compare, ElectraSense 4×2K microarray chips costs approximately $500 each and
            can be used four to five times, thus costing $25 to $31.25 per sample.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In summary, the ArboChip5.1 microarray can identify multiple genes from a wide range
            of mosquito-borne RNA viruses through broad-range PCR amplification and detection
            with virus-specific probes. It is vastly more multiplexed than PCR assays alone, more
            specific than universal microarrays, and more cost effective than most sequencing
            platforms. The microarray reader is small and rugged, making it field-portable. This
            system is an ideal tool for active surveillance or monitoring programs in regions
            where little is known about the circulating mosquito-borne viruses. We have demonstrated
            that it detects many viruses of medical importance, such as DENV, YFV, JEV, and CHIKV.
            In addition, the microarray targets many viruses that are also major causes of animal
            disease, such as RVFV, VEEV, and WNV. The ultimate goal is to provide researchers,
            veterinarians, and clinicians with a diagnostic tool that will allow them to recognize
            previously known pathogens that are emerging or re-emerging before they become major
            health issues.
