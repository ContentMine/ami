<abstract>
<p>Structural changes after ischemic stroke could affect information communication extensively in the brain network. It is likely that the defects in the white matter (WM) network play a key role in information interchange. In this study, we used graph theoretical analysis to examine potential organization alteration in the WM network architecture derived from diffusion tensor images from subjects with no dementia and experienced stroke in the past 5.4–14.8 months (N = 47, Mini-Mental Screening Examination, MMSE range 18–30), compared with a normal control group with 44 age and gender-matched healthy volunteers (MMSE range 26–30). Region-wise connectivity was derived from fiber connection density of 90 different cortical and subcortical parcellations across the whole brain. Both normal controls and patients with chronic stroke exhibited efficient small-world properties in their WM structural networks. Compared with normal controls, topological efficiency was basically unaltered in the patients with chronic stroke, as reflected by unchanged local and global clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and regional efficiency. No significant difference in hub distribution was found between normal control and patient groups. Patients with chronic stroke, however, were found to have reduced betweenness centrality and predominantly located in the orbitofrontal cortex, whereas increased betweenness centrality and vulnerability were observed in parietal-occipital cortex. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of patient is correlated with the betweenness centrality of right pallidum and local clustering coefficient of left superior occipital gyrus. Our findings suggest that patients with chronic stroke still exhibit efficient small-world organization and unaltered topological efficiency, with altered topology at orbitofrontal cortex and parietal-occipital cortex in the overall structural network. Findings from this study could help in understanding the mechanism of cognitive impairment and functional compensation occurred in patients with chronic stroke.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of adult disability, resulting from cessation of blood supply due to an occlusion of a cerebral artery. Patients suffered from ischemic stroke are at increased risk of developing vascular cognitive impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Del1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Tatemichi1">[2]</xref>, which ranges in severity from mild and/or isolated cognitive impairment to vascular dementia. Vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia is a prodromal, mild stage of dementia, lying on a continuum between normal cognition and dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-RamosEstebanez1">[3]</xref>. Among survivors of ischemic stroke, the prevalence of post-stroke dementia is about 30%, and the risk of dementia is doubled as compared with subjects who have not had stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Leys1">[4]</xref>. Hence, identification of factors that cause cognitive impairment would benefit interventions to prevent the progression to dementia.</p>
<p>Multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have been used to investigate the structural and functional changes in the brains of post-stroke patients. Structural MRI analyses included white matter (WM) lesion distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Wen1">[5]</xref>, gray matter atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Stebbins1">[6]</xref>, and frontal lobe atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Chen1">[7]</xref> were used to evaluate the cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) was also used to identify the post-stroke connectivity changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Carter1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Varoquaux1">[10]</xref>. Since diffusion tensor imaging is sensitive to detect the microstructural changes in WM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Nitkunan1">[11]</xref>, recent studies have investigated the post-stroke abnormalities of diffusion tensor measurements, such as mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy (FA), and apparent diffusion coefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Dudink1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Williamson1">[14]</xref>. In addition, complex network graphs that quantify interactions between brain regions have recently given new insights into the spontaneous reorganization of functional and structural brain networks after stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Buch1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Wang2">[17]</xref>. Although WM damages have been found to be potentially associated with the development of cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Williamson1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Black1">[18]</xref>, it remains unknown whether the overall WM organization of brain are affected in patients with no dementia after ischemic stroke.</p>
<p>Since diffusion MRI tractography is advantageous for investigating WM pathways and visualizing brain structural connectivity in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Gong1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Lazar1">[21]</xref>, graph theoretical approaches have been proposed to characterize the organization and architecture of the structural networks of the human brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Bullmore1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-IturriaMedina1">[24]</xref>. Indeed, the alteration in topological organization of brain WM network have been demonstrated useful to understand the cognitive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Wen2">[25]</xref> and to find the characteristic mechanisms of psychiatric and neurological diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Bai1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Zhang1">[31]</xref>. These studies indicate that it is feasible to employ DTI tractography to investigate structural networks in patients with chronic stroke. Our goal in this study is to apply WM tractography and graph theoretic analysis to investigate abnormalities in the organization and architecture of the structural connectivity pattern at the macroscopic scale in patients after ischemic stroke, based on the following hypotheses: (i) Patients with chronic stroke could exhibit efficient small-world topology, as has been successfully established in several disease models including stroke model in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-vanMeer1">[32]</xref>. On this basis we would like to further identify the possible alterations of overall topological properties compared with normal controls. Because either decreased small-world metrics related to impaired neural circuits directly caused by infarct lesions, or increased measurements reflecting excessive neuronal clustering and wiring after stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-vanMeer1">[32]</xref> or as a compensation mechanism as described previously in schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Zalesky1">[33]</xref>, possibly occurs in chronic stroke patients; (ii) Regions previously considered to be responsible for a certain type of cognitive impairment (e.g., post-stroke depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-LassalleLagadec1">[34]</xref>, executive dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Kramer1">[35]</xref>) could be identified with altered nodal characteristics, thus help to give an anatomical &amp; topological manifestation of post-stroke functional abnormality; (iii) Correlations between Mini-Mental Screening Examination (MMSE) or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and network characteristics can be possibly established. Since there are evidences suggest that functional or structural connectivity changes are correlated with MMSE score in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Cha1">[36]</xref>, and reflect the post-stroke motor network alterations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Jiang1">[37]</xref> and severity of stroke in rat model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-vanMeer1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>All the subjects were right-handed and were all informed and signed with a verbal and written consent form. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Forty-seven patients with no dementia after ischemic stroke (29 males and 18 females; 68.7±9.6 years old) and 44 age- and gender-matched normal controls (NC) (21 males and 23 females; 68.8±8.3 years old), were recruited from the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. Inclusion criteria for patients after ischemic stroke and no dementia were: (1) ischemic stroke within the past 5.4–14.8 months (average time 7.7±2.2 months), defined according to NINDS Stroke Data Bank criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Foulkes1">[38]</xref>; (2) age ≥50 years; (3) MMSE score ≥16; (4) competent to complete neuropsychological tests <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Wong1">[39]</xref>; (5) verbal and written consent; (6) available to collect patients' medical history from their caregivers (spent at least three days per week nursing the patients in the last five years). Inclusion criteria for NCs were: (1) age ≥50 years; (2) competent to complete neuropsychological tests; please refer to the NINDS-CSN protocols in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Wong1">[39]</xref>; (3) verbal and written consent; (4) MMSE score ≥24. The patient and NC groups had median MMSE scores of 25 (range 18–30) and 29 (range 26–30), respectively. Exclusion criteria for both NC and patient group included history of central nervous system disorder or disease. Twenty patients with chronic stroke possibly had cognitive impairment (MMSE &lt;24). No significant differences were found in age, gender and education between the two groups (all <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05).</p>

<title>MRI Acquisition</title>
<p>All subjects were scanned using a clinical 3T MRI scanner with an 8-channel Sense head coil (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems) at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. For each subject, T1-weighted (T1W) images, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, and diffusion tensor images (DTI) covering the whole brain were acquired in the axial orientation. T1W images were obtained using 3D fast field echo imaging sequence with the following parameters: (repetition time [TR]  = 6.7 ms, echo time [TE]  = 1.6 ms, number of excitation [NEX]  = 2, field of view [FOV]  = 220 mm, flip angle  = 15°, matrix  = 256×256, slice  = 128, voxel size  = 0.86×0.86×1.4 mm<sup>3</sup>. FLAIR image was obtained using following parameters: TR  = 11000 ms, TE  = 200 ms, Inversion Time [TI]  = 2800 ms, NEX  = 1, FOV  = 220 mm, flip angle  = 90°, matrix  = 704×704, slice  = 58, voxel size  = 0.31×0.31×3 mm<sup>3</sup>. DTI was obtained using single-shot echo planar imaging sequence with the following parameters: 15 diffusion weighted volumes (b = 750 s/mm<sup>2</sup>), one non-diffusion-weighted volume (b = 0 s/mm<sup>2</sup>), TR  = 10900 ms, TE  = 84.5 ms, NEX  = 2, FOV  = 220 mm, flip angle  = 90°, matrix  = 256×256, slice  = 55, voxel size  = 0.86×0.86×3 mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<title>Delineation and Mapping of Infarcts</title>
<p>The FLAIR image of each subject with chronic stroke was first co-registered to T1W images using FMRIB's Linear Registration Tool (FLIRT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Jenkinson1">[40]</xref>. The infarcts of each patient were manually delineated on FLAIR images with T1W image loaded as a reference by an experienced neuroradiologist (YYX). Then T1W image was co-registered to the ICBM152 template in Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using FMRIB's Non-linear Image Registration Tool (FNIRT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Andersson1">[41]</xref>, and the delineated infarcts was transformed to MNI space. The infarcts were masked out during the registration by setting their voxel values in the weighting volume as zero. Then the infarcts on gray matter and white matter were mapped to automated anatomical labeling (AAL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-TzourioMazoyer1">[42]</xref> and ICBM DTI-81 white matter labels atlas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Mori1">[43]</xref> respectively. The location of infarcts for each subject was determined by AAL and DTI-81 atlas with visual quality control, and the spatial distribution of infarcts of whole patient group was obtained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081388-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081388-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The brain was automatically partitioned into 90 non-cerebellar regions (45 cortical and subcortical regions in each hemisphere, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0081388-t002">Table 2</xref>) using the AAL parcellation atlas. For each subject, individual T1W image in the native DTI space was mapped to the ICBM152 template in MNI space using FNIRT, and the AAL atlas was inversely warped to the native DTI space by applying nearest-neighbor interpolation. The regions with detected infarcts were masked out before performing image registration, so that image registration was based on reliable information from image of normal tissues.</p>

<title>Network Graph Analysis</title>
<p>The topological organization of the weighted structural connectivity network was characterized at the nodal and global levels using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Rubinov1">[50]</xref> based on graph theory. The nodal behavior was quantified in terms of connection strength, local clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, regional efficiency and vulnerability. The global network architecture was described in terms of the global connection strength, global clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global betweenness centrality, global vulnerability, normalized clustering coefficient, normalized path length, and small-worldness. Each metric provided a different viewpoint to describe major features of the large-scale architecture.</p>

<title>Small-world Organization</title>
<p>Both normal controls and patients with chronic stroke were found to demonstrate small-world architectures. In particular, patients with chronic stroke displayed small-worldness close to the values of the structural networks in previous DTI-based studies with similar age groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Wen2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Lo1">[27]</xref>. Although WM networks of patients with chronic stroke showed prominent small-world attributes, several small-world measurements were found to be significantly altered. The patients showed increased small-worldness and decreased normalized characteristic path length, suggesting a more regular organization of WM network in patients with chronic stroke. Since there are no difference in characteristic path length (global level) and regional efficiency (nodal level), the decreased normalized characteristic path length is not necessarily an advantage in a complex network. The effective balance between local specialization and global integration arising from the small-world nature of anatomical connectivity possibly conserved in patients with chronic stroke. The increased small-worldness has also been observed in schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Zalesky1">[33]</xref>, during recovery from traumatic brain injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Nakamura1">[64]</xref>, and during recovery from stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-vanMeer1">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, as patients with chronic stroke have not shown strong changes in local and global clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, and regional efficiency, our findings suggest the topological efficiency is not unaltered between patients and NCs.</p>

<title>Alteration of Hub Distribution</title>
<p>Compared with the hub criteria based on the level of single nodal metrics in previous DTI-based studies, such as the betweenness centrality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Hanggi1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Shu2">[66]</xref> and regional efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Bai1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Shu1">[28]</xref>, the rank-based analysis of multiple nodal characteristics are more balanced and comprehensive. Thus, the identified hubs are partly consistent with those obtained from previous similar studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Hagmann2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-vandenHeuvel1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Zhang1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Yan1">[67]</xref>. Our results indicate no significant difference of the hub distribution between groups of NC and patient with chronic stroke (NC/post-stroke: 9/9 orbitofrontal regions, 2/2 temporal regions, 2/2 parietal regions, 4/4 occipital regions, 3/4 limbic regions, 3/2 basal ganglia regions, and bilateral insula, 12/11 left hemispherical regions, 13/14 right hemispherical regions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081388-g003">Figure. 3</xref>). Increased central role of right parietal-occipital cortex and decreased central role of left parietal-occipital cortex are observed in patients with chronic stroke, supported by the fact that total infarct number in left hemisphere is greater than that in right hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081388-g001">Figure. 1</xref>), since no difference in lesion volume (<italic>p</italic> = 0.301) or course of stroke (<italic>p</italic> = 0.864) was found between the patients with left and right lateralized infarct lesions.</p>

<title>Altered Nodal Characteristics</title>
<p>Group differences in betweenness centrality reflect the effects of the disease on the global roles of every node region. Reduced betweenness centrality is mainly observed in orbitofrontal cortex. The finding of decreased centrality in frontal lobe is in line with the pattern of frontal lobe atrophy in ischemic stroke patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Chen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Mok1">[68]</xref>. The orbitofrontal cortex is a prefrontal cortex region in the frontal lobes which is involved in the cognitive processing of decision-making. Five regions with decreased centrality were found in left orbitofrontal cortex of patients after ischemic stroke, supported by the fact that patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease often have executive dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Kramer1">[35]</xref>. Furthermore, cortical thinning in orbitofrontal gyrus has shown in vascular cognitive impairment associated with small vessel ischemic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Seo1">[69]</xref>. In this study, 20/47 patients exhibited cognitive impairment which support the findings of the orbitofrontal abnormalities. Decreased centrality is observed in four orbitofrontal hub regions, suggesting a decreased hub role of orbitofrontal regions in the brain network of patients. Interestingly, increased betweenness centrality is observed in parietal-occipital cortex. Increased centrality may indicate a shift to more parietal-occipital brain regions as a possible compensatory mechanism for decreased centrality of orbitofrontal regions. As the total infarct number in the left hemisphere is greater than that in the right hemisphere, the locations with altered centrality between the left and right hemispheres have showed the most asymmetry.</p>
<p>Apart from betweenness centrality, vulnerability is also used to characterize the influence of nodes in a network. As betweenness and vulnerability quantify the node in different aspects, the nodes with higher betweenness are not necessarily more vulnerable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Gong1">[19]</xref>. From the results in this study, the increased vulnerability is consistent with the increased betweenness in parietal-occipital cortex. Nevertheless, a decreased betweenness is found in the prefrontal cortex but no reduced vulnerability is observed. The occipital regions with increased vulnerability include cuneus [CUN] and superior occipital gyrus [SOG] in bilateral occipital lobe, which are important for visual processing. These changes suggest that these regions have increased influence in the brain communication compared with NCs. This could be a potential evidence for understanding of the visual system recovery in patients with chronic stroke. Particularly, we have observed reduction in both centrality and vulnerability in left rolandic operculum [ROL.L], which is a key component for speech processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Indefrey1">[70]</xref>. This finding is supported by the finding reported in the reduced white matter integrity and damaged tracts related to speech processing in post-stroke patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Breier1">[71]</xref>. The structural abnormality of this area was also reported to be associated with stuttering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Watkins1">[72]</xref>.</p>
<p>The connection strength is the most fundamental network measure, and provides information of the total degree of connectivity. Decreased connection strength is found in the left caudate [CAU.L] and left inferior temporal gyrus [ITG.L]. The altered connection strength in CAU.L is consistent with the pattern of altered communicability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Crofts1">[16]</xref>. The region of ITG.L is known to be included in the default mode network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Greicius1">[73]</xref>. The rs-fMRI has revealed the association between altered functional connectivity of left middle temporal cortex in the DMN and post-stroke depression severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-LassalleLagadec1">[34]</xref>. The decreased structural connectivity may give an anatomical comprehension of post-stroke depression. Imaging evidence also reveals the connectivity alteration of this region in post-stroke aphasia recovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Eaton1">[74]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Specht1">[75]</xref>. Specifically, the left superior occipital gyrus [SOG.L] presents significant increase in connection strength, centrality, and vulnerability, which is supported by reported gray matter atrophy in patients with ischemic stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Stebbins1">[6]</xref>. Recent research has associated degraded oral reading performance with acute left hemispheric stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Cloutman1">[76]</xref>. The betweenness of SOG.L is also larger than its counterpart in the right hemisphere in normal subjects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Gong1">[19]</xref>.</p>

<title>Correlation with the MMSE and NIHSS scores</title>
<p>Significant correlations were failed to be established between the MMSE score and the global or nodal characteristics. On one hand, the subjects studied are patients with no dementia, which means only mild cognitive impairment could be identified. On the other hand, MMSE provides only a general evaluation of cognitive function and suggests a compromised sensitivity in detecting mild cognitive dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-OBryant1">[77]</xref>. Furthermore, the severity of sensorimotor dysfunction, which is the major deficit after ischemic stroke, can not be reflected by MMSE. By contrast, NIHSS with more emphasis put on the aspects of sensorimotor functions was found to be correlated with the betweenness centrality of right pallidum [PAL.R] and the local clustering coefficient of SOG.L. Pallidum is mainly involved in the regulation of voluntary movement, and its change is supported by previous structural studies which revealed increased grey matter volume and cortical thickness in a series of motor-related areas during recovery from stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Brodtmann1">[78]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Fan1">[79]</xref>. Besides, the correlation between clustering coefficient of SOG.L and NIHSS further confirmed the increased connection strength, centrality, and vulnerability observed in this region, suggesting its increasingly critical role in the reorganized network after stroke.</p>

<title>Methodological Issues</title>
<p>Some methodological issues should be taken into account when interpreting our results. First, we used AAL atlas and FNIRT in FSL to perform brain parcellation. Since there is no widely accepted standard to construct cortical and subcortical regions in the brain, network nodes defined using atlas mapping are more valuable than random parcellation. Using different atlases, i.e., AAL atlas (90 cortical and subcortical regions), the Harvard–Oxford atlas (110 cortical and subcortical regions), Destrieux cortical atlas (66 cortical regions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Fischl1">[80]</xref>, and LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (54 cortical regions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Shattuck1">[81]</xref>, different node sets would be generated and thus different properties of network would be produced. Although a research has suggested that the properties of WM network are highly conserved over multiple atlases and spatial resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Bassett2">[82]</xref>, different parcellation strategies affect WM connectivity and may result in different topological properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Zalesky2">[83]</xref>. Moreover, voxel level (small area level) partition of cerebral cortex may be finer than atlas level partition if the parcellation methods are precise.</p>
<p>Second, we used fiber connection density as the inter-regional WM connectivity in the construction of the graphs. Previous researches have suggested different connectivity matrices for the WM network construction, i.e., fiber connection density <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Hagmann2">[23]</xref>, fiber number (FN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Shu1">[28]</xref>, mean FA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Wen2">[25]</xref>, normalized fiber number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Bassett2">[82]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-DuarteCarvajalino1">[84]</xref>, and multiplication between FN and mean FA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Lo1">[27]</xref>). FN-based connectivity matrices are used to describe the interconnection of fiber tracts among regions of interest and should always be normalized, as the number of fibers detected varies among individuals. Mean FA is computed by averaging FA values along the tract and is used to describe the organization of the underlying white matter. Although the physiological meaning of these measures is poorly understood, both FN and FA based connectivity matrices are commonly used to characterize white matter integrity, and similar results have been found from FN-weighted and FA-weighted network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Lo1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Zhang1">[31]</xref>. Compared with FN and FA, fiber connection density involved geometric measures including the volume of the cortical regions and the mean path length of fibers connecting each pair of regions is more stable.</p>
<p>Third, we used rank-based analysis of multiple nodal characteristics to identify the hub regions, and used hub score to describe the central role of hubs. Since there is no gold standard to define anatomical hubs, single or multiple nodal measures were usually used in other DTI-based studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Shu1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-vandenHeuvel1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Zhang1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Kim1">[49]</xref>. Compared with the level of single nodal metric, the rank-based criterion based on multiple nodal characteristics is more comprehensive to define a hub, and the hub score gives a quantitative description of its central role in the network.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have applied DTI tractography, WM connection mapping, and graph theoretic analysis to demonstrate altered organization of WM network in patients with chronic stroke. In this study, we comprehensively investigated different characteristics of WM connection in patients with chronic stroke and our findings suggest that patients have reduced betweenness centrality at orbitofrontal cortex, and increased betweenness centrality and vulnerability at parietal-occipital cortex, and exhibit efficient small-world organization and unaltered topological efficiencies. Compared to the NC, patients with chronic stroke exhibit significant increase of small-worldness, and connection strength <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0081388.e092" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula>, betweenness centrality <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0081388.e093" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula>, and vulnerability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0081388.e094" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> at left superior occipital gyrus [SOG.L], but significant decrease of normalized characteristic path length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0081388.e095" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula> and global betweenness centrality <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0081388.e096" xlink:type="simple" /></inline-formula>. Our results also demonstrated the MMSE score of patients with chronic stroke is not significantly correlated with network properties.</p>
<p>The abnormities at orbitofrontal cortex and parietal-occipital cortex may affect the information exchange, but need further verification by fMRI studies to understand the functional difference between groups. The results from this study provide extra information for understanding of white matter connectivity changes in patients with chronic stroke in addition to the diffusion parameters obtained in the previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Jones1">[85]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0081388-Wang4">[87]</xref>.</p>
