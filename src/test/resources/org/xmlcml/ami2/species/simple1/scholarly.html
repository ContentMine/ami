         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <div><p>Renewed commitment to control malaria over the last decade has resulted in major reductions
            in case incidence and disease mortality rates, and 32 of 99 countries with endemic
            malaria are pursuing an elimination strategy [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref001">1</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref002">2</span>]. Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, 
            <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> infections present unique and additional challenges for elimination due to the parasite’s
            propensity to relapse and the limitations of primaquine [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref001">1</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref003">3</span>]. Further, malaria resurgence has the potential to undermine control and elimination
            efforts [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref004">4</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref006">6</span>]. To this end, parasite population genetics studies are fundamental in identifying
            routes of transmission and gene flow, such that appropriate strategy for control and
            intervention might be implemented [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref007">7</span>].
         </p></div>
         <div tagx="p">Islands provide an ideal model for natural ecological experiments and present a great
            opportunity for intervention studies. Vanuatu is an archipelago consisting of 68 inhabited
            islands located at the southeastern limit of malaria transmission in the Pacific.
            Malaria is mainly hypo- to meso-endemic, with a general decrease in annual parasite
            incidence (API) from the northwest to the southeast. 
            <i>P. falciparum</i> and 
            <i>P. vivax</i> are the predominant species, with a slightly higher prevalence of the latter especially
            on the southern islands [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref008">8</span>]. Since the early 1990s, transmission rates have decreased as a result of malaria
            control measures and general improvement in health of the community [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref009">9</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref010">10</span>]. On the southernmost island of Aneityum, a comprehensive elimination program was
            initiated in 1991 and elimination was achieved with a high degree of commitment from
            the local community in 1999 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref011">11</span>]. The Aneityum Project served as a proof of principle for the intensification of
            the malaria control program with the ultimate goal of elimination [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref009">9</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref010">10</span>].

         <div tagx="p">Previous population genetics studies of 
            <i>P</i>. 
            <i>falciparum</i> and the malaria vector 
            <i>Anopheles farauti s</i>.
            <i>s</i>. in Vanuatu showed that populations were largely isolated on individual islands,
            with little gene flow among islands [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref012">12</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref013">13</span>]. These findings implied that malaria control measures might be carried out on an
            island-by-island basis, which is the strategy currently used in the Pacific [

         <div tagx="p">Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and circumsporozoite protein (CSP) are major surface
            antigens in 
            <i>P</i>. 
            <i>falciparum</i> and 
            <i>P vivax</i>. These antigens are highly polymorphic, making them useful markers for assessment
            of parasite genetic diversity [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref007">7</span>]. Earlier we examined 
            <i>msp1</i> and 
            <i>csp</i> polymorphisms in parasites from Vanuatu in the context of vaccine development for
            
            <i>P</i>. 
            <i>falciparum</i> [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref014">14</span>] and persisting humoral immunity after elimination on Aneityum Island for 
            <i>P</i>. 
            <i>vivax</i> [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0119475.ref005">5</span>]. In this study, using 
            <i>msp1</i> and 
            <i>csp</i> data previously generated for other aspects of malaria control, we compared the patterns
            of gene flow and population genetic structures in 
            <i>P</i>. 
            <i>falciparum</i> and 
            <i>P</i>. 
            <i>vivax</i> from seven sites on five islands in Vanuatu, and discussed the implications of our
            results in relation to the current malaria elimination strategy.
