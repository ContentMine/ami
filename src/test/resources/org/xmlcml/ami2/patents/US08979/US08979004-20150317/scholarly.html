         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to a pneumatic atomization nozzle for web moistening.</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magazines, books and other publications are frequently produced on heatset web offset
            printing presses. Offset printing involves transferring images to a web (e.g., roll
            of paper) via rotating drums. These drums have an inked impression of images which
            are transferred to the web as it travels across the rotating drums. In heatset printing,
            ink may be dried by blowing hot air over the web after the images have been imprinted.
            However, the hot air may reduce web moisture content, resulting in broken fibers,
            page growth and/or a wrinkled publication.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">To prevent this detrimental wrinkling, some printing presses employ a web remoistening
            system. For example, a web remoistening system may be used to spray the web with water
            after the drying process to remoisten the web. Current web remoistening systems utilize
            hydraulic atomization to achieve the desired web moisture content. In hydraulic atomization,
            a liquid is forced through a small orifice at high pressure to create droplets. Systems
            that employ hydraulic atomization are expensive because they must be constructed to
            withstand high liquid pressure. In addition, they require expensive high pressure
            pumps, liquid manifolds and solenoid valves. Furthermore, because the orifice is small,
            it tends to get clogged by impurities in the water. Therefore, hydraulic atomization
            systems typically spray de-ionized water, increasing operational costs. Moreover,
            hydraulic atomization systems are not well suited for web moistening at low flow rates
            because they tend to produce smaller droplets, thereby causing poor remoistening efficiency.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0033" num="0032">One or more specific embodiments of the present invention will be described below.
            In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of
            an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated
            that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or
            design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve
            the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related
            constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should
            be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming,
            but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture
            for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0034" num="0033">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present invention, the articles
            “a,” “an,” “the,” and “said” are intended to mean that there are one or more of the
            elements. The terms “comprising,” “including,” and “having” are intended to be inclusive
            and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Any
            examples of operating parameters and/or environmental conditions are not exclusive
            of other parameters/conditions of the disclosed embodiments.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments of the present disclosure may reduce the cost of web moistening systems
            and provide enhanced moistening performance by employing pneumatic web moistening
            nozzles. For example, compared to hydraulic atomization, pneumatic systems may achieve
            effective web moistening with lower liquid pressures. Lower pressure operation may
            significantly reduce the production and/or operational costs associated with web moistening
            systems. For example, manifolds and nozzles may be constructed from less expensive
            materials such as aluminum, stainless steel or plastic. In addition, as compared to
            the machined components of hydraulic atomizers, the manifolds and nozzles may be constructed
            from laminated layers including internal passages that are secured together to form
            complete structures. Because these internal passages may be formed using less expensive
            techniques (e.g., laser cutting, water jet, plasma cutting, etching, etc.), the overall
            cost and production time of web moistening systems may be reduced. In addition, smaller
            and less expensive liquid pumps (e.g., gear pumps, peristaltic pumps, etc.) may be
            employed for pneumatic web moistening systems. In certain embodiments, these pumps
            may be configured to regulate the flow of liquid without utilizing expensive pressure
            regulating valves.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0036" num="0035">In further embodiments, the web moistening system may employ a modular design configured
            to reduce construction costs by enabling faster assembly of the system. Specifically,
            modules may include preassembled nozzles, valves, manifolds, and associated electronic
            devices. When a customer orders a web moistening system, an appropriate number of
            modules may be readily mounted to the system. This construction technique may significantly
            reduce assembly time compared to individually mounting each nozzle, manifold, valve
            and electronic component to the web moistening system. In addition, each module may
            include a protective hood configured to block water from entering the module and interfering
            with operation of the valves and/or electronic components. Furthermore, pressurized
            air may be routed to each module to increase the pressure under the hood such that
            the internal pressure is greater than the external air pressure. This arrangement
            may prevent humid outside air and/or debris from entering the module. In certain configurations,
            the hood may be constructed from a transparent or semi-transparent material, such
            as a translucent plastic, for example. Such a configuration may enable an operator
            to visually determine which nozzles are in operation via lights mounted within the
            module.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further embodiments may include a manifold configured to provide air and liquid to
            the pneumatic nozzles. The manifold may include an air tube disposed about a water
            tube. This arrangement may limit the formation of condensation on the manifold. Specifically,
            the flow of air may thermally insulate the surface of the manifold from the cooler
            water. Maintaining the manifold at a warmer temperature may limit the formation of
            condensation. In certain configurations, the manifold may be positioned above a web.
            In such arrangements, limiting condensation on the manifold may prevent excess water
            from contacting and being absorbed by the web.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, the pneumatic web moistening nozzle includes a liquid orifice
            and a pair of pneumatic orifices disposed on opposite sides of the liquid orifice.
            In this configuration, liquid droplets emitted from the liquid orifice may form a
            substantially flat fan-shaped pattern in a plane of the orifices. Furthermore, in
            certain embodiments, the pneumatic web moistening nozzle may be configured to reduce
            a buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may interfere with gas flow through the
            pneumatic orifices. Specifically, in one embodiment, a surface defining each pneumatic
            orifice may include an angled portion configured to provide a point adjacent to each
            pneumatic orifice. Due to the small surface area of the point, any collected minerals
            may be dislodged by gas flow through the pneumatic orifices and/or vibrations of the
            pneumatic web moistening nozzle, thereby reducing the accumulation of minerals that
            may obstruct gas flow. In a second embodiment, each pneumatic orifice may include
            an expansion portion disposed on a side opposite from the liquid orifice. It is believed
            that the expansion portions may induce recirculation, causing deposits to accumulate
            on an angled portion and/or within a corner of each expansion portion. Any collected
            minerals may be dislodged by gas flow through the pneumatic orifices and/or vibrations
            of the pneumatic web moistening nozzle, thereby reducing the accumulation of minerals
            that may obstruct gas flow.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0038">As discussed in detail below, pneumatic web moistening nozzles may utilize larger
            liquid orifices and provide higher droplet velocities than hydraulic atomizers. The
            larger liquid orifice may be less prone to clogging because small particles may simply
            pass through instead of becoming lodged and obstructing liquid flow. Because the liquid
            orifice may be able to accommodate particles in the liquid, tap water may be used
            as the moistening liquid, instead of the more expensive de-ionized water. In addition,
            the larger liquid orifice may facilitate spraying other liquids, including silicone
            emulsions and lotion. Moreover, the higher droplet velocities may increase liquid

            	 presents a process flow diagram of heatset web offset printing 
            <b>10</b> using a unique web remoistening system in accordance with certain embodiments of
            the invention. First, as represented by block 
            <b>12</b>, ink is applied to a web. The web may be paper, for example, or any other substrate
            to which ink may be applied. In alternative embodiments, the web 
            <b>102</b> may be a metal sheet to which oil may be applied, for example. The web is stored
            in rolls, which are unwound as the web travels through the printing process 
            <b>10</b>. In offset printing, ink is first applied to a rotating plate cylinder by ink rollers.
            The ink is then transferred to an offset cylinder or rubber blanket cylinder which
            is in contact with the plate cylinder and rotating in the opposite direction. Finally,
            ink is applied to the web as it travels across the rotating offset cylinder.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, the ink is still wet at this point in the printing process 
            <b>10</b>. Therefore, the process 
            <b>10</b> may proceed to dry the ink in an oven, as represented by block 
            <b>14</b>. Web drying ovens generally circulate hot air over the web to dry the ink before
            it runs or smudges. Because the drying process 
            <b>14</b> may leave the web excessively hot, the web may be cooled on a series of chilled rollers,
            as represented by block 
            <b>16</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0042" num="0041">Heating the web in the oven, as represented by block 
            <b>14</b>, may have the undesirable effect of reducing web moisture content. If the web becomes
            too dry, wrinkling, broken fibers and/or page growth may occur during or after the
            binding process. Therefore, the printing process 
            <b>10</b> may employ a liquid spray system to remoisten the web, as represented by block 
            <b>18</b>. For example, the web remoistening system may employ a series of nozzles which spray
            a liquid onto the web as it travels through the system. In the disclosed embodiments,
            the web remoistening system may include pneumatic web moistening nozzles that provide
            high droplet deposition efficiency and substantially uniform spray patterns, while
            reducing mineral buildup that may interfere with the spray patterns. This configuration
            may provide increased web speed through the web remoistening system. Once the proper
            moisture content has been established, the web may be bound into its final publication
            form, as represented by block 
            <b>20</b>. For example, the web may be folded, cut and bound into books, magazines or brochures.

            	 shows a block diagram of one embodiment of a web moistening system 
            <b>100</b> using a unique configuration to enhance droplet deposition efficiency, reduce mineral
            buildup and provide uniform droplet distribution in accordance with certain embodiments
            of the invention. As previously discussed, a web 
            <b>102</b> may enter the moistening system 
            <b>100</b> after it has been cooled by the chilled rollers. The web 
            <b>102</b> may then pass over a grounded reversing roller 
            <b>104</b> and be charged by a corona-charging electrode 
            <b>106</b>. The corona-charging electrode 
            <b>106</b> bombards the web 
            <b>102</b> with ions (charged particles), inducing a positive charge on the surface of the web
            
            <b>102</b>. This positive charge is represented by plus signs located on the side of the web
            
            <b>102</b>. To ensure that the maximum possible charge is applied, the reversing roller 
            <b>104</b> may be grounded.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0044" num="0043">The web may then pass between a pair of spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. While only two spray devices 
            <b>108</b> are depicted in figref[FIG. 2]
            	, each spray device 
            <b>108</b> may represent a series of spray devices 
            <b>108</b> extending along the width of the web 
            <b>102</b> (e.g., perpendicular to the page). Also, additional spray devices 
            <b>108</b> may be positioned along the direction of travel of the web 
            <b>102</b>. The number and configuration of spray devices 
            <b>108</b> may be selected to achieve proper web moisture content. Each spray device 
            <b>108</b> may be grounded. During atomization, the positively charged web 
            <b>102</b> may induce a negative charge on the liquid droplets. In alternative embodiments,
            the corona-charging electrode 
            <b>106</b> may be configured to induce a negative charge on the surface of the web 
            <b>102</b>, which may impart a positive charge on the liquid droplets. As the droplets approach
            the web 
            <b>102</b>, they may then be electrostatically attracted to the web 
            <b>102</b>, resulting in enhanced atomization and/or increased liquid penetration.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0045" num="0044">The spray devices 
            <b>108</b> in the present embodiment may be pneumatic atomizers. As discussed in detail below,
            pneumatic atomizers may utilize large liquid orifices and provide high droplet velocities.
            The large liquid orifice may be less prone to clogging because small particles may
            simply pass through instead of becoming lodged and obstructing liquid flow. For example,
            an area of the large liquid orifices may be approximately 0.03 to 10, 0.1 to 5, 0.15
            to 1, or about 0.2 square millimeters. In contrast, an area of the smaller hydraulic
            orifices may be less than approximately 0.005 to 0.01 square millimeters. For example,
            in certain configurations, pneumatic orifices may be approximately 25 times larger
            than hydraulic orifices. Moreover, the high droplet velocities may increase liquid
            deposition efficiency. In addition, spray devices 
            <b>108</b> employing pneumatic atomization may propel droplets a greater distance than hydraulic
            atomizers. Specifically, as air pressure to a pneumatic atomizer is increased, droplets
            may be propelled a greater distance. In contrast, increasing liquid pressure in a
            hydraulic atomizer decreases droplet size, thereby reducing the distance a droplet
            may travel. For example, hydraulic atomizers may propel droplets approximately 1 foot,
            while pneumatic atomizers may propel droplets approximately 1.5 to 3, 2 to 4, or about
            2 feet. Spray devices 
            <b>108</b> may use both a gas source and a liquid source. Gas may be supplied by pneumatic supplies
            
            <b>110</b>, such as low pressure, high volume blowers, for example. Liquid may be supplied by
            liquid supplies 
            <b>112</b>. In this embodiment, a low liquid flow rate may be desired. Therefore, the liquid
            supplies 
            <b>112</b> may include gear pumps or peristaltic pumps. For example, gear pumps may be configured
            to provide a constant flow of liquid to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. In addition, flow rate may be easily adjusted by varying gear speed, gear size and
            number of teeth on each gear.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0046" num="0045">In certain embodiments, the liquid supply 
            <b>112</b> may include a storage tank configured to provide water, or other liquid, to the spray
            devices 
            <b>108</b>. In such configurations, the tank may be elevated relative to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b> to deliver an appropriate water pressure for web moistening. For example, in certain
            embodiments, the hydraulic head alone (i.e., without a pump) may be used to deliver
            the liquid (e.g., water) to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. Alternatively, or in combination with an elevated tank, a pump (e.g., gear pump
            or peristaltic pump) may be coupled to the tank to deliver liquid to the spray devices
            
            <b>108</b> at a desire pressure and/or flow rate. In certain embodiments, the pump may be configured
            to pressurize the liquid to less than approximately 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 bar, or approximately
            0.1 to 1 bar, 0.2 to 0.9 bar, 0.3 to 0.8 bar, 0.4 to 0.7 bar, or about 0.5 bar. As
            appreciated, these liquid pressures are significantly lower than those used for hydraulic
            atomization. For example, hydraulic atomizers may operate at liquid pressures between
            approximately 5 to 100 bar. Lower pressure operation may significantly decrease the
            production and operational costs of the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b> compared to higher pressure hydraulic atomization systems. For example, manifolds
            and nozzles for hydraulic atomizers are typically machined from solid blocks of material
            to eliminate joints that may leak at the higher pressures. Brass is generally employed
            for such pneumatic components because it is well suited for complex machining operations.
            However, machining components is both expensive and time consuming, thereby increasing
            production costs. In addition, to prevent corrosion of the brass components, caustic
            soda may be added to the liquid, thus increasing operational costs. In contrast, due
            to the lower pressures associated with pneumatic atomization, the manifolds and nozzles
            may be constructed from less expensive materials such as aluminum, composites (e.g.,
            fiberglass), stainless steel or plastic, for example. In certain embodiments, the
            manifolds and/or nozzles may be constructed from extruded aluminum having an anti-corrosion
            coating. In addition, as compared to machining components, the manifolds and nozzles
            may be constructed from laminated layers including internal passages that are secured
            together to form complete structures. Because these internal passages may be formed
            using less expensive techniques (e.g., laser cutting, water jet, plasma cutting, etching,
            etc.), the overall cost and production time of the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b> may be reduced.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0047" num="0046">As discussed above, certain embodiments may employ a gear pump to supply a liquid
            to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. A gear pump may include a housing containing a drive gear interlocked with an idle
            gear. The housing may be configured such that a minimum gap exists between an interior
            surface of the housing and teeth coupled to each gear. The drive gear may be coupled
            to a shaft that extends outside of the housing and is driven to rotate by an electric
            motor, for example. A liquid inlet and liquid outlet of the housing may be positioned
            perpendicular to the direction of gear rotation and aligned with the interlocking
            portion of the gears. As the drive gear rotates, the idle gear may be induced to rotate
            and liquid may be pumped from the inlet to the outlet via motion of the gear teeth.
            Specifically, as the teeth of the drive gear and idle gear rotate, liquid becomes
            trapped within a space defined by the gear teeth and the interior surface of the housing.
            As the gears rotate, the trapped liquid is transported from the inlet side of the
            housing to the outlet side. In this manner, the gear pump may provide a constant liquid
            flow.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further embodiments may employ a peristaltic pump. A peristaltic pump may include
            an annular flexible conduit and a rotor configured to compress a portion of the conduit.
            The flexible conduit may be disposed adjacent to an interior surface of a substantially
            rigid annular structure, and the rotor may be disposed adjacent to the conduit on
            an opposite side from the annular structure. The rotor may be connected to a shaft
            disposed within the center of the annular structure and driven to rotate by an electric
            motor, for example. As the shaft rotates, the rotor compresses the flexible conduit
            against the rigid annular structure. The rotor then moves along the entire circumferential
            extent of the flexible conduit, thereby establishing a pressure differential between
            liquid at an entrance to the conduit and the liquid exiting the conduit. This pressure
            differential induces liquid to flow through the pump in discrete pulses. As appreciated,
            flow rates for both the gear pump and the peristaltic pump may be varied by adjusting
            the speed of the driving motor to achieve a desired liquid pressure within the web
            moistening system 
            <b>100</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternative embodiments may utilize water provided by a public utility (i.e., tap
            water). However, the tap water may be supplied at greater than 3 bar, for example.
            Therefore, the liquid supply 
            <b>112</b> may be configured to reduce the liquid pressure prior to the liquid entering the
            spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. For example, the liquid supply 
            <b>112</b> may include a flow rate controller and/or a pressure regulator. The flow rate controller
            may be configured to selectively open and close a valve to allow a precise quantity
            of liquid to flow from the water source (e.g., public utility) to the spray devices
            
            <b>108</b>, thereby establishing a desired liquid pressure. Similarly, the pressure regulator
            may be configured to reduce the incoming pressure to a desired level, while accounting
            for pressure variations in the supplied liquid. The flow rate controller and/or the
            pressure regulator may ensure that the spray devices 
            <b>108</b> receive an appropriate liquid pressure (e.g., approximately 0.5 bar) such that a
            desired quantity of liquid is delivered to the web

            <b>132</b> is lower than a desired pressure for web moistening, the pump may increase the pressure
            to the desired level. In addition, the pump may be configured to precisely regulate
            the pressure and/or flow rate of liquid provided to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. In certain embodiments, the pump may have sufficient control of liquid flow to obviate

            <b>138</b> may be omitted. However, as appreciated, a peristaltic pump may provide uneven flow
            due to the pulsating nature of the pumping system. Therefore, configurations employing
            a peristaltic pump may also include the flow rate controller

            <b>146</b>. As previously discussed, the blower 
            <b>144</b> may be configured to provide low-pressure, high-volume air to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. For example, the blower 
            <b>144</b> may provide air at a flow rate of about 1 to 20, 2 to 10, or approximately 2 to 5
            standard cubic feet per hour. This configuration may enable the spray devices 
            <b>108</b> to properly atomize the liquid provided by liquid supply 
            <b>112</b>. In certain embodiments, the spray devices

            the blower 
            <b>144</b> may be a constant speed blower, thereby reducing the cost of the web moistening system
            
            <b>100</b>. In further embodiments, the constant speed blower may be coupled to a valve configured
            to vent a portion of the air to the outside. By adjusting the position of this valve,
            variable pneumatic flow rates may be achieved with a constant speed blower. Air may

         <p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b> includes a series of cables 
            <b>150</b> that link the control cabinet 
            <b>128</b> with spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. In certain embodiments, the cables 
            <b>150</b> are configured to provide both electrical power and control signals to the spray
            devices 
            <b>108</b>. Alternatively, separate control and power cables 
            <b>150</b> may be employed. As discussed in detail below, the spray devices 
            <b>108</b> may be organized into modules, with each module including a circuit board. A valve
            associated with each spray device 
            <b>108</b> may be coupled to the circuit board within each module. A cable 
            <b>150</b> electrically couples the control cabinet 
            <b>128</b> to a first module. Another cable 
            <b>150</b> then couples the first module to a second module. Further cables 
            <b>150</b> are provided such that each module is linked to a successive module. Control signals
            from the control cabinet 
            <b>128</b> flow through the cables 
            <b>150</b> to each successive module. For example, the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b> may employ the controller-area network (CAN or CAN-bus) standard to facilitate communication
            between the control cabinet 
            <b>128</b> and each module. This standard may enable various components of the web moistening
            system 
            <b>100</b> to communicate with one another without a host computer. Further embodiments may
            utilize the CANopen standard, which is an open protocol and may be better suited for
            web moistening systems 
            <b>100</b>. In certain embodiments, a single cable 
            <b>150</b> may connect with multiple modules, e.g., a single cable may include multiple connectors
            to plug into the multiple modules. For example, the system may include a single cable
            
            <b>150</b> for each row of modules or a single cable 
            <b>150</b> for all modules. Using the one or more cables 
            <b>150</b>, the control system 
            <b>114</b> may control the operation of each spray device 
            <b>108</b>. For example, certain webs 
            <b>102</b> may not extend along the entire width of the web moistening assembly. In such situations,
            certain spray devices 
            <b>108</b> (i.e., those not adjacent to the web 
            <b>102</b>) may be deactivated by closing valves associated with those spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. This configuration may conserve water by only activating spray devices 
            <b>108</b> adjacent to the web 
            <b>102</b>. In certain embodiments, web width and position may be determined automatically via
            sensors in the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b>. The control system 
            <b>114</b> may then activate the appropriate spray devices 
            <b>108</b> based on the detected web width and position.

            	. As illustrated, three modules 
            <b>152</b> are positioned on each row of spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. More or fewer modules 
            <b>152</b> may be employed in alternative embodiments. For example, certain configurations may
            include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more modules 
            <b>152</b> positioned along each side of the web 
            <b>102</b>. The number of modules 
            <b>152</b> may be selected based on web width. For example, web moistening systems 
            <b>100</b> configured to accommodate narrower webs 
            <b>102</b> may include fewer modules than those configured to accommodate wider webs 
            <b>102</b>. In addition, while 8 spray devices 
            <b>108</b> are coupled to each module 
            <b>152</b>, more or fewer spray devices 
            <b>108</b> may be included in alternative embodiments. For example, certain embodiments of the
            modules 
            <b>152</b> may include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, or more spray devices 
            <b>108</b> per module

         <p id="p-0058" num="0057">This modular configuration may reduce construction costs by enabling faster assembly
            of the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b>. For example, a number of modules 
            <b>152</b> may be assembled and stored. Each module 
            <b>152</b> may include preassembled spray devices 
            <b>108</b>, valves, manifolds, and associated electronic devices. When a customer orders a web
            moistening system 
            <b>100</b> configured to accommodate a particular web width, an appropriate number of modules
            
            <b>152</b> may be readily removed from storage and mounted to the system 
            <b>100</b>. This construction technique may significantly reduce assembly time compared to individually
            mounting each spray device 
            <b>108</b>, manifold, valve and electronic component to the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b>. Reduced construction time may facilitate lower manufacturing costs and faster deliver
            times.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, each module 
            <b>152</b> includes a protective hood 
            <b>154</b> disposed on an opposite side from the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. In alternative embodiments, the hood 
            <b>154</b> may be disposed on the same side of each module 
            <b>152</b> as the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. The hood 
            <b>154</b> may serve to block water from the spray devices 
            <b>108</b> from entering the module 
            <b>152</b> and interfering with operation of the valves and/or electronic components. This configuration
            may further reduce construction costs compared to individually sealing each valve/electronic
            assembly associated with each spray device 
            <b>108</b>. Pressurized air from the pneumatic supply 
            <b>110</b> may be routed through a conduit within a manifold 
            <b>156</b> to each module 
            <b>152</b>. The pressurized air may increase the pressure under the hood 
            <b>154</b> such that the internal pressure is greater than the external air pressure. This arrangement
            may block or oppose entry of external debris or humid outside air into the module
            
            <b>152</b> without employing expensive hood sealing devices. For example, the moisture content
            of the outside air may be greater than approximately 80% relative humidity due to
            the presence of water droplets from the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. This moist air may interfere with operation of the valves and/or electronic components
            within the module 
            <b>152</b>. Therefore, blocking outside air from entering the module 
            <b>152</b> via internal pressurization may ensure proper operation of the components within
            module 
            <b>152</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0060" num="0059">In certain configurations, the hood 
            <b>154</b> may be constructed from a transparent or semi-transparent material, such as a translucent
            plastic, for example. Such a configuration may enable an operator to visually determine
            which spray devices 
            <b>108</b> are in operation via lights mounted within the module. As previously discussed, each
            spray device 
            <b>108</b> may have an associated valve configured to regulate the flow of liquid and/or air
            into the spray device 
            <b>108</b>. These valves may be coupled to a common circuit board disposed within each module
            
            <b>152</b>. The circuit board may include a series of lights corresponding to the position of
            each valve. For example, the circuit board may include one light emitting diode (LED)
            for each valve. The LED may be configured to illuminate when the valve is open (i.e.,
            the associated spray device 
            <b>108</b> is in operation). In certain embodiments, a green light may indicate operation, a
            red light may indicate no operation, and/or a yellow light may indicate a problem.
            Any configuration of lights and colors may be used to indicate operational characteristics
            of the valves and other components of the modules 
            <b>152</b>. In this configuration, an operator may determine the position of each valve by visually
            inspecting the LEDs through the transparent or semi-transparent hood 
            <b>154</b>. This hood configuration may reduce construction costs compared to configurations
            employing opaque hoods 
            <b>154</b> with lights mounted on the surface. Specifically, the transparent or semi-transparent
            hood 
            <b>154</b> may obviate additional components and operations associated with sealing passages
            for wires and/or connectors coupled to external lights.

         <p id="p-0061" num="0060">As illustrated, the cable 
            <b>150</b> connects the mechanical/electrical enclosure 
            <b>126</b> to a first module 
            <b>152</b>. In certain embodiments, the cable 
            <b>150</b> is configured to electrically couple to the circuit board within the first module
            
            <b>152</b> via a first connector mounted on the bottom of the module 
            <b>152</b>. A second connector on the bottom of the first module 
            <b>152</b> may couple the circuit board to a second cable 
            <b>150</b> that electrically couples the first module 
            <b>152</b> to a second module 
            <b>152</b>. Similar configurations may be employed to link each of the modules 
            <b>152</b> together. This configuration may reduce construction costs compared to systems employing
            one or more cables linking each spray device 
            <b>108</b> to the enclosure 
            <b>126</b>. Furthermore, because the cable 
            <b>150</b> does not pass through the hoods 
            <b>154</b>, the hoods 
            <b>154</b> may be manufactured without holes and/or sealing devices (e.g., grommets), thereby

            <b>110</b> to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. The manifold 
            <b>156</b> also includes an inner structure defining a liquid passage 
            <b>160</b> configured to provide liquid from the liquid supply 
            <b>112</b> to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. As illustrated, the liquid passage 
            <b>160</b> is nested within the pneumatic passage 
            <b>158</b>. In other words, the pneumatic passage 
            <b>158</b> circumscribes the liquid passage 
            <b>160</b>. In the present embodiment, both the liquid passage 
            <b>160</b> and the pneumatic passage 
            <b>158</b> are rectangular. Alternative embodiments may employ other cross-sectional configurations,
            such as circular, polygonal or elliptical, for example. In addition, the liquid passage
            
            <b>160</b> of the present embodiment contacts the pneumatic passage 
            <b>158</b> along two surfaces. In further embodiments, the liquid passage 
            <b>160</b> may contact 0, 1 or 3 surfaces. As illustrated, the air inlet 
            <b>148</b> is coupled to the pneumatic passage 
            <b>158</b>, while the liquid inlet 
            <b>142</b> is coupled to the liquid passage 
            <b>160</b>. This coaxial configuration may reduce the formation of condensation on the surface

         </p>
         <p id="p-0063" num="0062">As previously discussed, evaporation of liquid droplets may increase air moisture
            content to approximately 80% or higher relative humidity. Therefore, if the liquid
            passing through a liquid passage is colder than the surrounding air, condensation
            may form on the liquid passage. As seen in figref[FIG. 4]
            	, one row of spray devices 
            <b>108</b> is positioned directly above one of the rollers. Therefore, any condensation that
            forms on a liquid passage may potentially fall onto the web 
            <b>102</b>. In addition, because the web may be positively charged, a negative charge may be
            induced on the falling droplets. In certain configurations, the charge may be sufficient
            to attract droplets toward the web 
            <b>102</b> even if a row of spray devices 
            <b>108</b> is not positioned directly above a roller. The opposite charge may cause the droplets
            to be readily absorbed into the web 
            <b>102</b>, thus resulting in excessive and non-uniform web moisture content. Furthermore, the
            water droplets may stain the web, thereby rendering a portion of the web unacceptable
            for publication. Therefore, limiting the formation of condensation on the surface
            of the manifold

            of the web.

         <p id="p-0064" num="0063">As appreciated, increasing air pressure also increases air temperature. Therefore,
            pressurized air from the blower 
            <b>144</b> may be warmer than the outside air. As illustrated in figref[FIG. 5]
            	, this warm air flowing through the air passage 
            <b>158</b> may at least partially surround the liquid passage 
            <b>160</b>, thereby thermally insulating the liquid from the outside air. Specifically, the
            warm air within the air passage 
            <b>158</b> may increase the surface temperature of the manifold 
            <b>156</b> such that significantly less condensation forms on the manifold 
            <b>156</b>. In other words, the warm air may thermally isolate the liquid passage 
            <b>160</b> from the surface of the manifold 
            <b>156</b>, thereby reducing condensation. In certain embodiments, the system may include a

            <b>152</b> in addition to providing liquid and air to the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. Specifically, each module

            <b>156</b> by bolts 
            <b>166</b>. While four bolts per module are illustrated in figref[FIG. 7]

         <p id="p-0068" num="0067">As previously discussed, the hood 
            <b>154</b> may serve to protect a circuit board 
            <b>180</b> and valves 
            <b>182</b> from external moisture and other contaminants. As illustrated, the circuit board
            
            <b>180</b> is mounted perpendicular to the manifold 
            <b>178</b>. In alternative configurations, the circuit board 
            <b>180</b> may be mounted parallel and adjacent to the manifold 
            <b>178</b> (i.e., between the manifold 
            <b>178</b> and the valves 
            <b>182</b>), or above the valves 
            <b>182</b>. In the present embodiment, each valve 
            <b>182</b> is positioned directly opposite the manifold 
            <b>178</b> from each spray device 
            <b>108</b>. As discussed in detail below, the manifold 
            <b>178</b> is configured to direct a flow of liquid through each valve 
            <b>182</b> prior to directing the liquid into the spray device 
            <b>108</b>. Each valve 
            <b>182</b> includes a connector 
            <b>184</b> that may be coupled to the circuit board 
            <b>180</b>. As previously discussed, the cable 
            <b>150</b> may couple to the circuit board 
            <b>180</b> to control the operation of the valves 
            <b>182</b>. Control signals from the cable 
            <b>150</b> may pass through the circuit board 
            <b>180</b> to each of the valves 
            <b>182</b> via the connectors 
            <b>184</b>. Such an arrangement may reduce construction costs compared to providing each valve
            
            <b>182</b> with an individual electronic control unit. In certain embodiments, the connectors
            
            <b>184</b> may be configured to plug directly into the circuit board 
            <b>180</b>. This configuration may reduce construction costs due to decreased assembly time
            and fewer parts (e.g., connecting wires). In addition, LEDs 
            <b>185</b> may be mounted to the circuit board 
            <b>180</b> to indicate the operation of each spray device 
            <b>108</b>. For example, a control signal may direct a valve 
            <b>182</b> to open. The circuit board 
            <b>180</b> may include circuitry configured to detect the position of each valve 
            <b>182</b> and illuminate an LED associated with the valve 
            <b>182</b> to indicate valve position (e.g., lit LED indicates valve is open).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0069" num="0068">In further embodiments, the circuit board 
            <b>180</b> may include additional circuitry configured to directly control valve operation based
            on input pressures or flow rates. For example, the control system 
            <b>114</b> may output a desired liquid flow rate to each of the modules 
            <b>152</b> via the cables 
            <b>150</b>. Circuitry within each circuit board 
            <b>180</b> may then adjust the liquid flow through each spray device 
            <b>108</b> to achieve the desired flow rate. This configuration may facilitate an even distribution
            of liquid droplets across the web 
            <b>102</b>.

         <p id="p-0070" num="0069">In certain embodiments, the manifold 
            <b>178</b> may be composed of multiple layers. These layers may be stacked to form a complete
            structure including internal liquid and pneumatic passages. As illustrated, the manifold
            
            <b>178</b> includes an orientation guide 
            <b>187</b> to ensure proper orientation (e.g., stacking) of the multiple layers. In certain
            embodiments, the guide 
            <b>187</b> may be a diagonal mark 
            <b>187</b> on one side or edge of the multiple layers. Specifically, if any layer is not in
            the correct order, the mark 
            <b>187</b> may not appear as a diagonal line. This configuration may serve to ensure proper
            flow of air and liquid through the manifold 
            <b>178</b>. The mark 
            <b>187</b> may be located at any suitable position about the circumference of the manifold 
            <b>178</b>. The mark 
            <b>187</b> may be etched into the structure of the manifold 
            <b>178</b> or marked on the surface. In alternative embodiments, the orientation guide 
            <b>187</b> may include an arcuate line, a series of indents, a series of notches, or the like,
            wherein these indicia indicate a proper order of the layers. As discussed in detail
            below, a similar orientation guide may be used on multiple layers of the spray devices

         <p id="p-0072" num="0071">The spray devices

            <b>196</b> for each spray device 
            <b>108</b>. As discussed in detail below, each spray device

         <p id="p-0073" num="0072">As discussed in detail below, the spray devices 
            <b>108</b> may include multiple layers secured together by the bolts 
            <b>191</b>. However, these layers may be pre-assembled prior to delivery to a customer. For
            example, if a spray device 
            <b>108</b> is not functioning properly, it may be removed for maintenance. However, once the
            bolts 
            <b>191</b> are removed the layers may separate from one another, thereby increasing the possibility
            that the layers may be reassembled in an incorrect order. Therefore, each spray device
            
            <b>108</b> may include one or more bolts or rivets that secure the layers together. This configuration
            may facilitate enhanced removal and attachment of spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. In certain embodiments, the securing bolt or rivet may be located in a corner of
            the spray device 
            <b>108</b> such that each layer may rotate with respect to the next. In such a configuration,
            passages within the spray device

            <b>108</b> during operation and/or while removing and reinstalling spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. For example, due to high web speeds, contaminants attached to the web 
            <b>102</b> may be dislodged and impact the modules 
            <b>152</b>. However, because the spray devices 
            <b>108</b> are positioned below the manifold 
            <b>178</b>, any debris from the web 
            <b>102</b> may be deposited on an opposite surface from the spray devices 
            <b>108</b>. This configuration may increase the time between maintenance cycles, thereby reducing

            The frequency and amplitude of this vacillation may be controlled by varying the liquid

            <b>302</b> and 
            <b>408</b>, respectively. In the present embodiment, the width 
            <b>415</b> of liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b> is substantially similar to the width 
            <b>417</b> of pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. However, widths 
            <b>415</b> and 
            <b>417</b> may vary in alternative embodiments. In addition, the length 
            <b>303</b> of liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b> may be approximately two times the width 
            <b>415</b>, as illustrated in figref[FIG. 13]
            	. Alternatively, the length 
            <b>303</b> may be about 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 or more times the width
            
            <b>415</b> of liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b>, for example. Similarly, as illustrated in figref[FIG. 13]
            	, the length 
            <b>409</b> of pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b> may be four times the width 
            <b>417</b>. In alternative embodiments, the length 
            <b>409</b> may be about 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5 or more times the width
            
            <b>417</b> of pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>, for example.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0092" num="0091">Furthermore, orifice spacing may be varied to alter the frequency and/or amplitude
            of droplet vacillation, for example. As illustrated, pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b> are spaced a distance 
            <b>419</b> from liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b> along lateral axis 
            <b>413</b>. As presented in figref[FIG. 13]
            	, spacing 
            <b>419</b> is approximately 1.5 times the width 
            <b>415</b> of liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b>. In alternative embodiments, the spacing 
            <b>419</b> may be about 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 or more times the width 
            <b>415</b> of liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b>. Further embodiments may enhance droplet formation by minimizing the spacing around
            liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b>, such that spacing 
            <b>419</b> approaches zero. By adjusting dimensions of nozzle components, spray patterns may
            be configured for particular applications.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0093" num="0092">One advantage of the present embodiment is that the liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b> may be larger than the liquid orifice of a hydraulic atomizer. Hydraulic atomizers
            generally require a small liquid orifice to sufficiently accelerate the liquid linearly
            and/or rotationally such that it atomizes. In contrast, pneumatic atomizers use gas
            flow to atomize liquid. Therefore, a larger liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b> may be employed. Larger liquid orifices may be less prone to clogging because small
            particles may simply pass through instead of becoming lodged and obstructing liquid
            flow. Because the liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b> may be able to accommodate particles in the liquid, tap water may be used as the
            moistening liquid, instead of the more expensive de-ionized water typically utilized
            in hydraulic atomizers. In addition, the larger liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b> may facilitate spraying other liquids, including silicone and lotion, that may induce
            clogging and/or be too viscous to flow through the smaller orifice of a hydraulic
            atomizer.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, pneumatic atomization may utilize substantially less water than hydraulic
            atomization, thereby reducing operational costs. Specifically, to achieve proper atomization
            using a hydraulic system, a high water flow rate may be utilized. For example, a flow
            rate of approximately 1 liter per hour through each nozzle may be employed to achieve
            proper droplet formation via hydraulic atomization. However, desired flow rates may
            be significantly less than 1 liter per hour for proper web moistening. Therefore,
            a shield may be partially disposed within the spray pattern to block a portion of
            the liquid from contacting the web 
            <b>102</b>. For example, if a flow rate of 0.3 liters per hour is desired, the shield may redirect
            0.7 liters per hour. Because the redirected water may not be recovered and reused,
            0.7 liter per hour of water may be wasted for each nozzle. In contrast, because pneumatic
            atomization utilizes air flow to achieve proper atomization, liquid flow rates may
            be decreased without adversely affecting droplet formation. For example, pneumatic
            atomization may enable the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b> to vary flow rates between approximately 0.1 to 3.0, 0.2 to 2.5, or 0.3 to 2.0 liters
            per hour for each spray device 
            <b>108</b>. In other words, the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b> in the present embodiment may include a flow rate ratio (minimum to maximum) of approximately
            1:20.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0095" num="0094">Moreover, pneumatic atomization may facilitate increased droplet size compared to
            hydraulic atomization, thereby further reducing water consumption. For example, hydraulic
            atomizers may produce droplets between approximately 20 to 100 microns in diameter.
            In contrast, pneumatic atomizers may produce droplets between approximately 100 to
            1000, 200 to 800, or 300 to 500 microns in diameter. The larger droplets may experience
            less evaporation as they travel from the spray device 
            <b>108</b> to the web 
            <b>102</b>. Specifically, for a given quantity of water, larger droplets yield a smaller total
            surface area than smaller droplets because fewer larger droplets are formed. As appreciated,
            evaporation rate is dependent on surface area. Therefore, larger droplets may experience
            less evaporation, thereby reducing the quantity of water emanated from the spray devices
            
            <b>108</b> to achieve a desired web moisture content. In addition, larger droplets may result
            in a greater deposition efficiency compared to smaller droplets because the larger
            droplets may penetrate farther into the web 
            <b>102</b>. In certain embodiments, deposition efficiency may increase between approximately
            20% to 50%. Finally, water consumption may be reduced because a greater percentage
            of the larger droplets may overcome the web boundary layer. As appreciated, due to
            high web speeds through the system 
            <b>100</b>, the web 
            <b>102</b> may develop a boundary layer that may redirect the flow of droplets away from the
            web 
            <b>102</b>. Due to the greater mass associated with larger droplets, more droplets may overcome
            this boundary layer and contact the web 
            <b>102</b>. The combination of the mechanisms described above may decrease water consumption,
            thereby reducing operating costs.

            <b>404</b> to the liquid orifice 
            <b>302</b>. Similarly, two vertical pneumatic conduits 
            <b>618</b> are located in layer

            <b>408</b>. The vertical pneumatic conduits 
            <b>618</b> are configured to control gas flow under a given pressure drop. Specifically, smaller
            conduit size reduces gas consumption under the same pressure drop. As can best be

            	, a diameter

            <b>408</b> during operation of the spray device 
            <b>108</b>. For example, the liquid supply 
            <b>112</b> may provide the spray device 
            <b>108</b> with “softened” water. Softened water is formed by passing tap water, for example,
            through a reverse-osmosis filter. However, this process may add small amounts of salt
            to the water. During operation of the web moistening system 
            <b>100</b>, liquid droplets from the liquid orifice

            <b>703</b> and the curved portion

            with the flow of gas from pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. As illustrated, gas emitted from pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b> may flow in a downstream direction 
            <b>712</b>. As appreciated, the flowing gas may establish a region of low pressure, drawing
            surrounding air toward the flow. The curved portion 
            <b>705</b> is configured to direct the air flow toward the point 
            <b>703</b>. Specifically, the curved portion 
            <b>705</b> converges with an inner surface of the horizontal pneumatic conduit 
            <b>620</b> in the downstream direction, thereby forming the point

            <b>705</b> in a direction 
            <b>714</b>. Water droplets may be captured by the air flow and directed toward the point 
            <b>703</b>. A portion of the water droplets may adhere to the point 
            <b>703</b>, while other droplets remain in the air flow. Over time, the droplets that adhere
            to the point 
            <b>703</b> may evaporate, causing an accumulation of salt and/or other minerals on the point
            
            <b>703</b>, as represented by buildup 
            <b>716</b>. However, due to the small surface area associated with the point 
            <b>703</b>, air flow from the surface of the curved portion 
            <b>705</b> and/or gas flow from the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b> may dislodge the buildup 
            <b>716</b> from the point 
            <b>703</b>. Specifically, the flows may apply a shear force along the point 
            <b>703</b> in a direction away from the spray device 
            <b>108</b>. As previously discussed, the small surface area of the point 
            <b>703</b> increases the likelihood that a given flow pressure may dislodge the buildup 
            <b>716</b>. Therefore, the flows may remove the buildup 
            <b>716</b> from the point 
            <b>703</b> and carry it in a downstream direction 
            <b>712</b>. In addition, the spray device 
            <b>108</b> may vibrate during operation, providing an additional force to extricate the buildup
            
            <b>716</b>. Therefore, the quantity of salt and/or other minerals deposited adjacent to the
            pneumatic orifices

            <b>716</b> on the point 
            <b>703</b> may be further reduced because a portion of the water droplets captured by the air
            flow along the surface of the curved portion 
            <b>705</b> may remain in the air flow. As illustrated, water droplets captured by air flowing
            in direction

            <b>703</b> and flow in a direction

            may remain in the flow. Because some of the water droplets do not adhere to the point
            
            <b>703</b>, less buildup 
            <b>716</b> may be formed. In certain embodiments, the direction

            <b>712</b> of the gas flow from the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. In this configuration, the air flow from the curved portion 
            <b>705</b> may combine with the gas flow from the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. In addition, a portion of the air and/or gas flow may return to the curved portion
            
            <b>705</b>, thus establishing a recirculating flow in direction 
            <b>714</b>. The combination of directing water droplets away from the spray device 
            <b>108</b> and the small surface area of the point

            The alternative fifth layer may be substantially similar to layer

            <b>408</b> of the alternative embodiment of the fourth layer 
            <b>810</b>, showing the flow path of gas (e.g., air) around the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. As previously described, expansion portion 
            <b>803</b> is configured to reduce the buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may interfere
            with the flow of gas from pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. As illustrated, gas emitted from pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b> may flow in a downstream direction 
            <b>821</b>. As appreciated, the flowing gas may establish a region of low pressure, drawing
            surrounding air toward the flow. Specifically, gas from the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b> and/or surrounding air may recirculate in a direction 
            <b>822</b>. Water droplets may be captured by the air flow and directed toward the point 
            <b>808</b>. A portion of the water droplets may adhere to the point 
            <b>808</b>, while other droplets remain in the air flow. Over time, the droplets that adhere
            to the point 
            <b>808</b> may evaporate, causing an accumulation of salt and/or other minerals on the point
            
            <b>808</b>, as represented by buildup 
            <b>824</b>. However, due to the small surface area associated with the point 
            <b>808</b>, recirculating air flow along direction 
            <b>822</b> and/or gas flow from the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b> may dislodge the buildup 
            <b>824</b> from the point 
            <b>808</b>. Specifically, the flows may apply a shear force along the point 
            <b>808</b> in a direction away from the spray device 
            <b>108</b>. As previously discussed, the small surface area of the point 
            <b>808</b> increases the likelihood that a given flow pressure may dislodge the buildup 
            <b>824</b>. Therefore, the flows may remove the buildup 
            <b>824</b> from the point 
            <b>808</b> and carry it in a downstream direction 
            <b>821</b>. In addition, the spray device 
            <b>108</b> may vibrate during operation, providing an additional force to extricate the buildup
            
            <b>824</b>. Therefore, the quantity of salt and/or other minerals deposited adjacent to the
            pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b> may be minimized. Furthermore, the buildup 
            <b>824</b> on the point 
            <b>808</b> may be substantially outside of the flow path of gas emitted from the horizontal
            pneumatic conduits 
            <b>620</b>. Consequently, flow conditions may be generally uniform over extended use of the
            spray device 
            <b>108</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0122" num="0121">In addition, buildup 
            <b>824</b> on the point 
            <b>808</b> may be further reduced because a portion of the water droplets captured by the recirculating
            air may remain in the air flow. As illustrated, water droplets captured by air flowing
            in direction 
            <b>822</b> may bypass the point 
            <b>808</b> and flow in a direction 
            <b>826</b>. For example, more than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% of the water droplets
            may remain in the flow. Because some of the water droplets do not adhere to the point
            
            <b>808</b>, less buildup 
            <b>824</b> may be formed. In certain embodiments, the direction 
            <b>826</b> may be substantially similar to the downstream direction 
            <b>821</b> of the gas flow from the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. In this configuration, the recirculating air flow may combine with the gas from
            the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. In addition, a portion of the air and/or gas flow may return to the exit surface
            
            <b>805</b>, thus establishing the recirculating flow in direction 
            <b>822</b>. Further embodiments may include a curved recess in the exit surface 
            <b>805</b> adjacent to the expansion portion 
            <b>803</b> and configured to direct the air flow toward the point 
            <b>808</b>. The combination of directing water droplets away from the spray device 
            <b>108</b> and the small surface area of the point 
            <b>808</b> may reduce salt and/or mineral buildup that may interfere with gas flow from pneumatic
            orifices 
            <b>408</b>, thereby maintaining a substantially uniform spray pattern 
            <b>304</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0123" num="0122">It is believed that a second recirculation zone may be formed within the expansion
            portion 
            <b>803</b>. Specifically, a portion of the gas flowing through the horizontal pneumatic conduits
            
            <b>620</b> may flow in a direction 
            <b>828</b> prior to exiting the pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. Water droplets may be captured within the recirculating flow and deposited in the
            interior corner 
            <b>816</b> of the expansion portion 
            <b>803</b>. As the water evaporates, a buildup 
            <b>830</b> may be formed within the corner 
            <b>816</b>. As illustrated, the buildup 
            <b>830</b> may be substantially outside of the flow path of gas emitted from the horizontal
            pneumatic conduits 
            <b>620</b>. In this manner, the buildup 
            <b>830</b> may not interfere with the gas flow from pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>. Over time, the buildup 
            <b>830</b> may expand as additional salt and/or other minerals are deposited in the corner 
            <b>816</b>. However, once the buildup 
            <b>830</b> reaches a critical size, it may become dislodged by the gas flow from the horizontal
            pneumatic conduits 
            <b>620</b>. Therefore, the size of buildup 
            <b>830</b> may be limited to prevent interference with the gas flow. The combination of features
            described above may reduce salt and/or mineral deposits within and/or surrounding
            pneumatic orifices 
            <b>408</b>, thereby maintaining a substantially uniform spray pattern 
            <b>304</b>.

            <b>905</b> and/or are redirected away from the spray device 
            <b>108</b>. Any salt and/or mineral buildup on the point 
            <b>905</b> may be dislodged by gas flow and/or vibration of the spray device 
            <b>108</b>. In this manner, salt and/or mineral buildup within the flow path of the pneumatic
            orifices 
            <b>408</b> may be reduced. In addition, layer 
            <b>902</b> includes an expansion portion 
            <b>906</b> within each horizontal pneumatic conduit 
            <b>620</b>. The expansion portions

            exit surface 
            <b>908</b>. As previously discussed, recirculation within the expansion portion 
            <b>906</b> may deposit salt and/or other minerals outside of the flow path of gas emitted from
            horizontal pneumatic conduits 
            <b>620</b>. In contrast to the rectangular expansion portions 
            <b>803</b> described above with regard to figref[FIGS. 22-24]
            	, the expansion portions
