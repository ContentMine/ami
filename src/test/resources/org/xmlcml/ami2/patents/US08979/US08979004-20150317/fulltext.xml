<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/400,146, entitled &#x201c;Pneumatic Atomization Nozzle for Web Moistening&#x201d;, filed Mar. 9, 2009, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to a pneumatic atomization nozzle for web moistening.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Magazines, books and other publications are frequently produced on heatset web offset printing presses. Offset printing involves transferring images to a web (e.g., roll of paper) via rotating drums. These drums have an inked impression of images which are transferred to the web as it travels across the rotating drums. In heatset printing, ink may be dried by blowing hot air over the web after the images have been imprinted. However, the hot air may reduce web moisture content, resulting in broken fibers, page growth and/or a wrinkled publication.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To prevent this detrimental wrinkling, some printing presses employ a web remoistening system. For example, a web remoistening system may be used to spray the web with water after the drying process to remoisten the web. Current web remoistening systems utilize hydraulic atomization to achieve the desired web moisture content. In hydraulic atomization, a liquid is forced through a small orifice at high pressure to create droplets. Systems that employ hydraulic atomization are expensive because they must be constructed to withstand high liquid pressure. In addition, they require expensive high pressure pumps, liquid manifolds and solenoid valves. Furthermore, because the orifice is small, it tends to get clogged by impurities in the water. Therefore, hydraulic atomization systems typically spray de-ionized water, increasing operational costs. Moreover, hydraulic atomization systems are not well suited for web moistening at low flow rates because they tend to produce smaller droplets, thereby causing poor remoistening efficiency.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One or more specific embodiments of the present invention will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present invention, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and &#x201c;said&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Any examples of operating parameters and/or environmental conditions are not exclusive of other parameters/conditions of the disclosed embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments of the present disclosure may reduce the cost of web moistening systems and provide enhanced moistening performance by employing pneumatic web moistening nozzles. For example, compared to hydraulic atomization, pneumatic systems may achieve effective web moistening with lower liquid pressures. Lower pressure operation may significantly reduce the production and/or operational costs associated with web moistening systems. For example, manifolds and nozzles may be constructed from less expensive materials such as aluminum, stainless steel or plastic. In addition, as compared to the machined components of hydraulic atomizers, the manifolds and nozzles may be constructed from laminated layers including internal passages that are secured together to form complete structures. Because these internal passages may be formed using less expensive techniques (e.g., laser cutting, water jet, plasma cutting, etching, etc.), the overall cost and production time of web moistening systems may be reduced. In addition, smaller and less expensive liquid pumps (e.g., gear pumps, peristaltic pumps, etc.) may be employed for pneumatic web moistening systems. In certain embodiments, these pumps may be configured to regulate the flow of liquid without utilizing expensive pressure regulating valves.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In further embodiments, the web moistening system may employ a modular design configured to reduce construction costs by enabling faster assembly of the system. Specifically, modules may include preassembled nozzles, valves, manifolds, and associated electronic devices. When a customer orders a web moistening system, an appropriate number of modules may be readily mounted to the system. This construction technique may significantly reduce assembly time compared to individually mounting each nozzle, manifold, valve and electronic component to the web moistening system. In addition, each module may include a protective hood configured to block water from entering the module and interfering with operation of the valves and/or electronic components. Furthermore, pressurized air may be routed to each module to increase the pressure under the hood such that the internal pressure is greater than the external air pressure. This arrangement may prevent humid outside air and/or debris from entering the module. In certain configurations, the hood may be constructed from a transparent or semi-transparent material, such as a translucent plastic, for example. Such a configuration may enable an operator to visually determine which nozzles are in operation via lights mounted within the module.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further embodiments may include a manifold configured to provide air and liquid to the pneumatic nozzles. The manifold may include an air tube disposed about a water tube. This arrangement may limit the formation of condensation on the manifold. Specifically, the flow of air may thermally insulate the surface of the manifold from the cooler water. Maintaining the manifold at a warmer temperature may limit the formation of condensation. In certain configurations, the manifold may be positioned above a web. In such arrangements, limiting condensation on the manifold may prevent excess water from contacting and being absorbed by the web.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, the pneumatic web moistening nozzle includes a liquid orifice and a pair of pneumatic orifices disposed on opposite sides of the liquid orifice. In this configuration, liquid droplets emitted from the liquid orifice may form a substantially flat fan-shaped pattern in a plane of the orifices. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, the pneumatic web moistening nozzle may be configured to reduce a buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may interfere with gas flow through the pneumatic orifices. Specifically, in one embodiment, a surface defining each pneumatic orifice may include an angled portion configured to provide a point adjacent to each pneumatic orifice. Due to the small surface area of the point, any collected minerals may be dislodged by gas flow through the pneumatic orifices and/or vibrations of the pneumatic web moistening nozzle, thereby reducing the accumulation of minerals that may obstruct gas flow. In a second embodiment, each pneumatic orifice may include an expansion portion disposed on a side opposite from the liquid orifice. It is believed that the expansion portions may induce recirculation, causing deposits to accumulate on an angled portion and/or within a corner of each expansion portion. Any collected minerals may be dislodged by gas flow through the pneumatic orifices and/or vibrations of the pneumatic web moistening nozzle, thereby reducing the accumulation of minerals that may obstruct gas flow.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As discussed in detail below, pneumatic web moistening nozzles may utilize larger liquid orifices and provide higher droplet velocities than hydraulic atomizers. The larger liquid orifice may be less prone to clogging because small particles may simply pass through instead of becoming lodged and obstructing liquid flow. Because the liquid orifice may be able to accommodate particles in the liquid, tap water may be used as the moistening liquid, instead of the more expensive de-ionized water. In addition, the larger liquid orifice may facilitate spraying other liquids, including silicone emulsions and lotion. Moreover, the higher droplet velocities may increase liquid deposition efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> presents a process flow diagram of heatset web offset printing <b>10</b> using a unique web remoistening system in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention. First, as represented by block <b>12</b>, ink is applied to a web. The web may be paper, for example, or any other substrate to which ink may be applied. In alternative embodiments, the web <b>102</b> may be a metal sheet to which oil may be applied, for example. The web is stored in rolls, which are unwound as the web travels through the printing process <b>10</b>. In offset printing, ink is first applied to a rotating plate cylinder by ink rollers. The ink is then transferred to an offset cylinder or rubber blanket cylinder which is in contact with the plate cylinder and rotating in the opposite direction. Finally, ink is applied to the web as it travels across the rotating offset cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, the ink is still wet at this point in the printing process <b>10</b>. Therefore, the process <b>10</b> may proceed to dry the ink in an oven, as represented by block <b>14</b>. Web drying ovens generally circulate hot air over the web to dry the ink before it runs or smudges. Because the drying process <b>14</b> may leave the web excessively hot, the web may be cooled on a series of chilled rollers, as represented by block <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Heating the web in the oven, as represented by block <b>14</b>, may have the undesirable effect of reducing web moisture content. If the web becomes too dry, wrinkling, broken fibers and/or page growth may occur during or after the binding process. Therefore, the printing process <b>10</b> may employ a liquid spray system to remoisten the web, as represented by block <b>18</b>. For example, the web remoistening system may employ a series of nozzles which spray a liquid onto the web as it travels through the system. In the disclosed embodiments, the web remoistening system may include pneumatic web moistening nozzles that provide high droplet deposition efficiency and substantially uniform spray patterns, while reducing mineral buildup that may interfere with the spray patterns. This configuration may provide increased web speed through the web remoistening system. Once the proper moisture content has been established, the web may be bound into its final publication form, as represented by block <b>20</b>. For example, the web may be folded, cut and bound into books, magazines or brochures.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of one embodiment of a web moistening system <b>100</b> using a unique configuration to enhance droplet deposition efficiency, reduce mineral buildup and provide uniform droplet distribution in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention. As previously discussed, a web <b>102</b> may enter the moistening system <b>100</b> after it has been cooled by the chilled rollers. The web <b>102</b> may then pass over a grounded reversing roller <b>104</b> and be charged by a corona-charging electrode <b>106</b>. The corona-charging electrode <b>106</b> bombards the web <b>102</b> with ions (charged particles), inducing a positive charge on the surface of the web <b>102</b>. This positive charge is represented by plus signs located on the side of the web <b>102</b>. To ensure that the maximum possible charge is applied, the reversing roller <b>104</b> may be grounded.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The web may then pass between a pair of spray devices <b>108</b>. While only two spray devices <b>108</b> are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each spray device <b>108</b> may represent a series of spray devices <b>108</b> extending along the width of the web <b>102</b> (e.g., perpendicular to the page). Also, additional spray devices <b>108</b> may be positioned along the direction of travel of the web <b>102</b>. The number and configuration of spray devices <b>108</b> may be selected to achieve proper web moisture content. Each spray device <b>108</b> may be grounded. During atomization, the positively charged web <b>102</b> may induce a negative charge on the liquid droplets. In alternative embodiments, the corona-charging electrode <b>106</b> may be configured to induce a negative charge on the surface of the web <b>102</b>, which may impart a positive charge on the liquid droplets. As the droplets approach the web <b>102</b>, they may then be electrostatically attracted to the web <b>102</b>, resulting in enhanced atomization and/or increased liquid penetration.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The spray devices <b>108</b> in the present embodiment may be pneumatic atomizers. As discussed in detail below, pneumatic atomizers may utilize large liquid orifices and provide high droplet velocities. The large liquid orifice may be less prone to clogging because small particles may simply pass through instead of becoming lodged and obstructing liquid flow. For example, an area of the large liquid orifices may be approximately 0.03 to 10, 0.1 to 5, 0.15 to 1, or about 0.2 square millimeters. In contrast, an area of the smaller hydraulic orifices may be less than approximately 0.005 to 0.01 square millimeters. For example, in certain configurations, pneumatic orifices may be approximately 25 times larger than hydraulic orifices. Moreover, the high droplet velocities may increase liquid deposition efficiency. In addition, spray devices <b>108</b> employing pneumatic atomization may propel droplets a greater distance than hydraulic atomizers. Specifically, as air pressure to a pneumatic atomizer is increased, droplets may be propelled a greater distance. In contrast, increasing liquid pressure in a hydraulic atomizer decreases droplet size, thereby reducing the distance a droplet may travel. For example, hydraulic atomizers may propel droplets approximately 1 foot, while pneumatic atomizers may propel droplets approximately 1.5 to 3, 2 to 4, or about 2 feet. Spray devices <b>108</b> may use both a gas source and a liquid source. Gas may be supplied by pneumatic supplies <b>110</b>, such as low pressure, high volume blowers, for example. Liquid may be supplied by liquid supplies <b>112</b>. In this embodiment, a low liquid flow rate may be desired. Therefore, the liquid supplies <b>112</b> may include gear pumps or peristaltic pumps. For example, gear pumps may be configured to provide a constant flow of liquid to the spray devices <b>108</b>. In addition, flow rate may be easily adjusted by varying gear speed, gear size and number of teeth on each gear.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In certain embodiments, the liquid supply <b>112</b> may include a storage tank configured to provide water, or other liquid, to the spray devices <b>108</b>. In such configurations, the tank may be elevated relative to the spray devices <b>108</b> to deliver an appropriate water pressure for web moistening. For example, in certain embodiments, the hydraulic head alone (i.e., without a pump) may be used to deliver the liquid (e.g., water) to the spray devices <b>108</b>. Alternatively, or in combination with an elevated tank, a pump (e.g., gear pump or peristaltic pump) may be coupled to the tank to deliver liquid to the spray devices <b>108</b> at a desire pressure and/or flow rate. In certain embodiments, the pump may be configured to pressurize the liquid to less than approximately 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 bar, or approximately 0.1 to 1 bar, 0.2 to 0.9 bar, 0.3 to 0.8 bar, 0.4 to 0.7 bar, or about 0.5 bar. As appreciated, these liquid pressures are significantly lower than those used for hydraulic atomization. For example, hydraulic atomizers may operate at liquid pressures between approximately 5 to 100 bar. Lower pressure operation may significantly decrease the production and operational costs of the web moistening system <b>100</b> compared to higher pressure hydraulic atomization systems. For example, manifolds and nozzles for hydraulic atomizers are typically machined from solid blocks of material to eliminate joints that may leak at the higher pressures. Brass is generally employed for such pneumatic components because it is well suited for complex machining operations. However, machining components is both expensive and time consuming, thereby increasing production costs. In addition, to prevent corrosion of the brass components, caustic soda may be added to the liquid, thus increasing operational costs. In contrast, due to the lower pressures associated with pneumatic atomization, the manifolds and nozzles may be constructed from less expensive materials such as aluminum, composites (e.g., fiberglass), stainless steel or plastic, for example. In certain embodiments, the manifolds and/or nozzles may be constructed from extruded aluminum having an anti-corrosion coating. In addition, as compared to machining components, the manifolds and nozzles may be constructed from laminated layers including internal passages that are secured together to form complete structures. Because these internal passages may be formed using less expensive techniques (e.g., laser cutting, water jet, plasma cutting, etching, etc.), the overall cost and production time of the web moistening system <b>100</b> may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As discussed above, certain embodiments may employ a gear pump to supply a liquid to the spray devices <b>108</b>. A gear pump may include a housing containing a drive gear interlocked with an idle gear. The housing may be configured such that a minimum gap exists between an interior surface of the housing and teeth coupled to each gear. The drive gear may be coupled to a shaft that extends outside of the housing and is driven to rotate by an electric motor, for example. A liquid inlet and liquid outlet of the housing may be positioned perpendicular to the direction of gear rotation and aligned with the interlocking portion of the gears. As the drive gear rotates, the idle gear may be induced to rotate and liquid may be pumped from the inlet to the outlet via motion of the gear teeth. Specifically, as the teeth of the drive gear and idle gear rotate, liquid becomes trapped within a space defined by the gear teeth and the interior surface of the housing. As the gears rotate, the trapped liquid is transported from the inlet side of the housing to the outlet side. In this manner, the gear pump may provide a constant liquid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further embodiments may employ a peristaltic pump. A peristaltic pump may include an annular flexible conduit and a rotor configured to compress a portion of the conduit. The flexible conduit may be disposed adjacent to an interior surface of a substantially rigid annular structure, and the rotor may be disposed adjacent to the conduit on an opposite side from the annular structure. The rotor may be connected to a shaft disposed within the center of the annular structure and driven to rotate by an electric motor, for example. As the shaft rotates, the rotor compresses the flexible conduit against the rigid annular structure. The rotor then moves along the entire circumferential extent of the flexible conduit, thereby establishing a pressure differential between liquid at an entrance to the conduit and the liquid exiting the conduit. This pressure differential induces liquid to flow through the pump in discrete pulses. As appreciated, flow rates for both the gear pump and the peristaltic pump may be varied by adjusting the speed of the driving motor to achieve a desired liquid pressure within the web moistening system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternative embodiments may utilize water provided by a public utility (i.e., tap water). However, the tap water may be supplied at greater than 3 bar, for example. Therefore, the liquid supply <b>112</b> may be configured to reduce the liquid pressure prior to the liquid entering the spray devices <b>108</b>. For example, the liquid supply <b>112</b> may include a flow rate controller and/or a pressure regulator. The flow rate controller may be configured to selectively open and close a valve to allow a precise quantity of liquid to flow from the water source (e.g., public utility) to the spray devices <b>108</b>, thereby establishing a desired liquid pressure. Similarly, the pressure regulator may be configured to reduce the incoming pressure to a desired level, while accounting for pressure variations in the supplied liquid. The flow rate controller and/or the pressure regulator may ensure that the spray devices <b>108</b> receive an appropriate liquid pressure (e.g., approximately 0.5 bar) such that a desired quantity of liquid is delivered to the web <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The corona-charging electrode <b>106</b>, the pneumatic supplies <b>110</b> and the liquid supplies <b>112</b> may be controlled by a control system <b>114</b>. The control system <b>114</b> may include an electrostatic controller <b>116</b>, a liquid supply controller <b>118</b>, a pneumatic supply controller <b>120</b>, a computer system <b>122</b> and a user interface <b>124</b>. For example, the electrostatic controller <b>116</b> may adjust the voltage and/or current supplied to the corona-charging electrode <b>106</b> based on a desired web charge. Similarly, the liquid supply controller <b>118</b> and the pneumatic supply controller <b>120</b> may adjust the output of the liquid supply <b>112</b> and the pneumatic supply <b>110</b>. For example, if the liquid supplies <b>112</b> include gear pumps, the liquid supply controller <b>118</b> may adjust the speed of each gear pump based on a desired liquid flow rate. The liquid supply controller <b>118</b> may be described as a continuous flow controller, and may continuously adjust the gear pump to maintain accurate control of the flow rate. Each of the individual controllers may be regulated by the computer system <b>122</b> coupled to the user interface <b>124</b>. The user interface <b>124</b> may allow an operator to adjust parameters of the web moistening system <b>100</b> through a graphical user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a web moistening system <b>100</b> having a unique atomization mechanism in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention. In this embodiment, the web (not shown) may enter along the reversing roller <b>104</b>. The web may then pass between two rows of spray devices <b>108</b>, one on each side of the web. Each spray device <b>108</b> may spray a fan shaped stream of liquid onto the web, establishing the desired moisture content. Because the present embodiment utilizes pneumatic atomizers, the liquid stream may have a greater velocity than web moistening systems <b>100</b> employing hydraulic atomizers. This higher velocity stream may increase liquid deposition efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As illustrated, a mechanical/electrical enclosure <b>126</b> is disposed adjacent to the web moistening section of the system <b>100</b>. In certain embodiments, the enclosure <b>126</b> may be covered by one or more panels to protect the electrical and mechanical components disposed within the enclosure <b>126</b>. The enclosure <b>126</b> includes a control cabinet <b>128</b> that may include elements of the control system <b>114</b> previously described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Furthermore, the enclosure <b>126</b> includes a high-voltage electrical supply <b>130</b> that may provide electrical power to the corona-charging electrode <b>106</b>. Components of the pneumatic supply <b>110</b> and the liquid supply <b>112</b> are also contained within the enclosure <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present embodiment, the liquid supply <b>112</b> includes a liquid inlet <b>132</b>, an inlet pressure controller <b>134</b>, a liquid filter <b>136</b>, a flow rate controller <b>138</b>, and liquid outlets <b>140</b>. For example, water from a public utility may enter the liquid supply <b>112</b> through the liquid inlet <b>132</b>. The water may then flow into the inlet pressure controller <b>134</b> (e.g., pressure regulator). The inlet pressure controller <b>134</b> may be configured to reduce the pressure of the incoming water to a desired level appropriate for web moistening. The inlet pressure controller <b>134</b> may also monitor incoming water pressure to ensure the pressure is sufficient for web moistening. The water may then flow into the liquid filter <b>136</b> to remove contaminants that may be present within the tap water. Specifically, the liquid filter <b>136</b> may be configured to collect particulate matter within the water such that the particulates do not obstruct flow paths downstream from the filter <b>136</b>. The water flows from the filter <b>136</b> to the flow rate controller <b>138</b>. As previously described, the flow rate controller <b>138</b> may be configured to provide continuous liquid flow regulation, i.e., accurate control and/or precise adjustment of liquid flow rates. In certain embodiments, the flow rate controller <b>138</b> may include a flow meter coupled to a low pressure controller configured to monitor and continuously adjust liquid flow to achieve a desired level. For example, pressure may be adjusted such that the spray devices <b>108</b> provide approximately 2 grams of water for each square meter of the web <b>102</b>, thereby establishing a proper web moisture content. As appreciated, the flow rate may be higher or lower depending upon the configuration of the web <b>102</b> (e.g., initial moisture content, material properties, binding operations, etc.). For example, the flow rate controller <b>138</b> may be configured to enable the spray devices <b>108</b> to provide approximately 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, or more grams of water for each square meter of the web <b>102</b>. The water from the flow rate controller <b>138</b> then flows to the liquid outlets <b>140</b>. A hose (not shown) or other suitable fluid connector may couple the flow rate controller <b>138</b> to the liquid outlets <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternative embodiments may include a gear pump or peristaltic pump to flow the liquid from the liquid inlet <b>132</b> to the liquid outlets <b>140</b>. For example, if the liquid pressure entering the liquid inlet <b>132</b> is lower than a desired pressure for web moistening, the pump may increase the pressure to the desired level. In addition, the pump may be configured to precisely regulate the pressure and/or flow rate of liquid provided to the spray devices <b>108</b>. In certain embodiments, the pump may have sufficient control of liquid flow to obviate the pressure regulating functions of the inlet pressure controller <b>134</b> and/or the flow rate controller <b>138</b>. In such embodiments, these controllers <b>134</b> and/or <b>138</b> may be omitted. However, as appreciated, a peristaltic pump may provide uneven flow due to the pulsating nature of the pumping system. Therefore, configurations employing a peristaltic pump may also include the flow rate controller <b>138</b> downstream from the pump to provide a substantially constant liquid pressure to the outlets <b>140</b>. The liquid outlets <b>140</b>, in turn, may provide liquid to a liquid inlet <b>142</b> within the web moistening section of the system <b>100</b>. A hose or other fluid connector (not shown) may couple the outlets <b>140</b> to an inlet <b>142</b> on each row of spray devices <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The pneumatic supply <b>110</b> may include a blower <b>144</b> and pneumatic outlets <b>146</b>. As previously discussed, the blower <b>144</b> may be configured to provide low-pressure, high-volume air to the spray devices <b>108</b>. For example, the blower <b>144</b> may provide air at a flow rate of about 1 to 20, 2 to 10, or approximately 2 to 5 standard cubic feet per hour. This configuration may enable the spray devices <b>108</b> to properly atomize the liquid provided by liquid supply <b>112</b>. In certain embodiments, the spray devices <b>108</b> may be configured to utilize a constant pneumatic flow rate. In such embodiments, the blower <b>144</b> may be a constant speed blower, thereby reducing the cost of the web moistening system <b>100</b>. In further embodiments, the constant speed blower may be coupled to a valve configured to vent a portion of the air to the outside. By adjusting the position of this valve, variable pneumatic flow rates may be achieved with a constant speed blower. Air may be transferred from the pneumatic outlets <b>146</b> to a pneumatic inlet <b>148</b> disposed on each row of spray devices <b>108</b>. A hose or other pneumatic connector (not shown) may couple the outlets <b>146</b> to the inlets <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, the web moistening system <b>100</b> includes a series of cables <b>150</b> that link the control cabinet <b>128</b> with spray devices <b>108</b>. In certain embodiments, the cables <b>150</b> are configured to provide both electrical power and control signals to the spray devices <b>108</b>. Alternatively, separate control and power cables <b>150</b> may be employed. As discussed in detail below, the spray devices <b>108</b> may be organized into modules, with each module including a circuit board. A valve associated with each spray device <b>108</b> may be coupled to the circuit board within each module. A cable <b>150</b> electrically couples the control cabinet <b>128</b> to a first module. Another cable <b>150</b> then couples the first module to a second module. Further cables <b>150</b> are provided such that each module is linked to a successive module. Control signals from the control cabinet <b>128</b> flow through the cables <b>150</b> to each successive module. For example, the web moistening system <b>100</b> may employ the controller-area network (CAN or CAN-bus) standard to facilitate communication between the control cabinet <b>128</b> and each module. This standard may enable various components of the web moistening system <b>100</b> to communicate with one another without a host computer. Further embodiments may utilize the CANopen standard, which is an open protocol and may be better suited for web moistening systems <b>100</b>. In certain embodiments, a single cable <b>150</b> may connect with multiple modules, e.g., a single cable may include multiple connectors to plug into the multiple modules. For example, the system may include a single cable <b>150</b> for each row of modules or a single cable <b>150</b> for all modules. Using the one or more cables <b>150</b>, the control system <b>114</b> may control the operation of each spray device <b>108</b>. For example, certain webs <b>102</b> may not extend along the entire width of the web moistening assembly. In such situations, certain spray devices <b>108</b> (i.e., those not adjacent to the web <b>102</b>) may be deactivated by closing valves associated with those spray devices <b>108</b>. This configuration may conserve water by only activating spray devices <b>108</b> adjacent to the web <b>102</b>. In certain embodiments, web width and position may be determined automatically via sensors in the web moistening system <b>100</b>. The control system <b>114</b> may then activate the appropriate spray devices <b>108</b> based on the detected web width and position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of a modular web moistening assembly taken within line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As illustrated, three modules <b>152</b> are positioned on each row of spray devices <b>108</b>. More or fewer modules <b>152</b> may be employed in alternative embodiments. For example, certain configurations may include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more modules <b>152</b> positioned along each side of the web <b>102</b>. The number of modules <b>152</b> may be selected based on web width. For example, web moistening systems <b>100</b> configured to accommodate narrower webs <b>102</b> may include fewer modules than those configured to accommodate wider webs <b>102</b>. In addition, while 8 spray devices <b>108</b> are coupled to each module <b>152</b>, more or fewer spray devices <b>108</b> may be included in alternative embodiments. For example, certain embodiments of the modules <b>152</b> may include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, or more spray devices <b>108</b> per module <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">This modular configuration may reduce construction costs by enabling faster assembly of the web moistening system <b>100</b>. For example, a number of modules <b>152</b> may be assembled and stored. Each module <b>152</b> may include preassembled spray devices <b>108</b>, valves, manifolds, and associated electronic devices. When a customer orders a web moistening system <b>100</b> configured to accommodate a particular web width, an appropriate number of modules <b>152</b> may be readily removed from storage and mounted to the system <b>100</b>. This construction technique may significantly reduce assembly time compared to individually mounting each spray device <b>108</b>, manifold, valve and electronic component to the web moistening system <b>100</b>. Reduced construction time may facilitate lower manufacturing costs and faster deliver times.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, each module <b>152</b> includes a protective hood <b>154</b> disposed on an opposite side from the spray devices <b>108</b>. In alternative embodiments, the hood <b>154</b> may be disposed on the same side of each module <b>152</b> as the spray devices <b>108</b>. The hood <b>154</b> may serve to block water from the spray devices <b>108</b> from entering the module <b>152</b> and interfering with operation of the valves and/or electronic components. This configuration may further reduce construction costs compared to individually sealing each valve/electronic assembly associated with each spray device <b>108</b>. Pressurized air from the pneumatic supply <b>110</b> may be routed through a conduit within a manifold <b>156</b> to each module <b>152</b>. The pressurized air may increase the pressure under the hood <b>154</b> such that the internal pressure is greater than the external air pressure. This arrangement may block or oppose entry of external debris or humid outside air into the module <b>152</b> without employing expensive hood sealing devices. For example, the moisture content of the outside air may be greater than approximately 80% relative humidity due to the presence of water droplets from the spray devices <b>108</b>. This moist air may interfere with operation of the valves and/or electronic components within the module <b>152</b>. Therefore, blocking outside air from entering the module <b>152</b> via internal pressurization may ensure proper operation of the components within module <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In certain configurations, the hood <b>154</b> may be constructed from a transparent or semi-transparent material, such as a translucent plastic, for example. Such a configuration may enable an operator to visually determine which spray devices <b>108</b> are in operation via lights mounted within the module. As previously discussed, each spray device <b>108</b> may have an associated valve configured to regulate the flow of liquid and/or air into the spray device <b>108</b>. These valves may be coupled to a common circuit board disposed within each module <b>152</b>. The circuit board may include a series of lights corresponding to the position of each valve. For example, the circuit board may include one light emitting diode (LED) for each valve. The LED may be configured to illuminate when the valve is open (i.e., the associated spray device <b>108</b> is in operation). In certain embodiments, a green light may indicate operation, a red light may indicate no operation, and/or a yellow light may indicate a problem. Any configuration of lights and colors may be used to indicate operational characteristics of the valves and other components of the modules <b>152</b>. In this configuration, an operator may determine the position of each valve by visually inspecting the LEDs through the transparent or semi-transparent hood <b>154</b>. This hood configuration may reduce construction costs compared to configurations employing opaque hoods <b>154</b> with lights mounted on the surface. Specifically, the transparent or semi-transparent hood <b>154</b> may obviate additional components and operations associated with sealing passages for wires and/or connectors coupled to external lights.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As illustrated, the cable <b>150</b> connects the mechanical/electrical enclosure <b>126</b> to a first module <b>152</b>. In certain embodiments, the cable <b>150</b> is configured to electrically couple to the circuit board within the first module <b>152</b> via a first connector mounted on the bottom of the module <b>152</b>. A second connector on the bottom of the first module <b>152</b> may couple the circuit board to a second cable <b>150</b> that electrically couples the first module <b>152</b> to a second module <b>152</b>. Similar configurations may be employed to link each of the modules <b>152</b> together. This configuration may reduce construction costs compared to systems employing one or more cables linking each spray device <b>108</b> to the enclosure <b>126</b>. Furthermore, because the cable <b>150</b> does not pass through the hoods <b>154</b>, the hoods <b>154</b> may be manufactured without holes and/or sealing devices (e.g., grommets), thereby reducing the cost of hood construction.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional side view of the manifold <b>156</b> including a thermally isolated liquid passage taken along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The manifold <b>156</b> includes an outer structure defining a pneumatic passage <b>158</b> configured to provide air from the pneumatic supply <b>110</b> to the spray devices <b>108</b>. The manifold <b>156</b> also includes an inner structure defining a liquid passage <b>160</b> configured to provide liquid from the liquid supply <b>112</b> to the spray devices <b>108</b>. As illustrated, the liquid passage <b>160</b> is nested within the pneumatic passage <b>158</b>. In other words, the pneumatic passage <b>158</b> circumscribes the liquid passage <b>160</b>. In the present embodiment, both the liquid passage <b>160</b> and the pneumatic passage <b>158</b> are rectangular. Alternative embodiments may employ other cross-sectional configurations, such as circular, polygonal or elliptical, for example. In addition, the liquid passage <b>160</b> of the present embodiment contacts the pneumatic passage <b>158</b> along two surfaces. In further embodiments, the liquid passage <b>160</b> may contact 0, 1 or 3 surfaces. As illustrated, the air inlet <b>148</b> is coupled to the pneumatic passage <b>158</b>, while the liquid inlet <b>142</b> is coupled to the liquid passage <b>160</b>. This coaxial configuration may reduce the formation of condensation on the surface of the manifold <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As previously discussed, evaporation of liquid droplets may increase air moisture content to approximately 80% or higher relative humidity. Therefore, if the liquid passing through a liquid passage is colder than the surrounding air, condensation may form on the liquid passage. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, one row of spray devices <b>108</b> is positioned directly above one of the rollers. Therefore, any condensation that forms on a liquid passage may potentially fall onto the web <b>102</b>. In addition, because the web may be positively charged, a negative charge may be induced on the falling droplets. In certain configurations, the charge may be sufficient to attract droplets toward the web <b>102</b> even if a row of spray devices <b>108</b> is not positioned directly above a roller. The opposite charge may cause the droplets to be readily absorbed into the web <b>102</b>, thus resulting in excessive and non-uniform web moisture content. Furthermore, the water droplets may stain the web, thereby rendering a portion of the web unacceptable for publication. Therefore, limiting the formation of condensation on the surface of the manifold <b>156</b> may reduce the possibility of excessive and non-uniform web moisture and/or staining of the web.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As appreciated, increasing air pressure also increases air temperature. Therefore, pressurized air from the blower <b>144</b> may be warmer than the outside air. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, this warm air flowing through the air passage <b>158</b> may at least partially surround the liquid passage <b>160</b>, thereby thermally insulating the liquid from the outside air. Specifically, the warm air within the air passage <b>158</b> may increase the surface temperature of the manifold <b>156</b> such that significantly less condensation forms on the manifold <b>156</b>. In other words, the warm air may thermally isolate the liquid passage <b>160</b> from the surface of the manifold <b>156</b>, thereby reducing condensation. In certain embodiments, the system may include a heater to elevate the temperature of the air, the manifold <b>156</b>, or a combination thereof.</p>

The liquid flowing in direction <b>162</b> may cause condensation to form on the liquid passage <b>160</b>. However, because the liquid passage <b>160</b> is completely circumscribed by the pneumatic passage <b>158</b>, any condensation that forms on the surface of the liquid passage <b>160</b> may be contained within the pneumatic passage <b>158</b>. Furthermore, condensation may be dislodged and captured by air flow in direction <b>164</b>, and ultimately expelled through the spray devices <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the modular web moistening assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> showing certain web moistening modules <b>152</b> separated from the manifold <b>156</b>. As previously discussed, this configuration may reduce construction costs by facilitating decreased assembly time of the web moistening system <b>100</b>. As illustrated, the manifolds <b>156</b> may serve to support the modules <b>152</b> in addition to providing liquid and air to the spray devices <b>108</b>. Specifically, each module <b>152</b> may be secured to the manifold <b>156</b> by bolts <b>166</b>. While four bolts per module are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, alternative embodiments may include more or few bolts, such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more bolts <b>166</b>. In addition, manifold <b>156</b> includes four liquid passages <b>168</b> and two pneumatic passages <b>170</b> for each module <b>152</b>. As appreciated, more or fewer passages <b>168</b> and/or <b>170</b> may be employed in alternative embodiments. For example, the manifold <b>156</b> may include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more passages <b>168</b> and/or <b>170</b> for each module <b>152</b>. As discussed in detail below, each module <b>152</b> includes corresponding orifices configured to align with the passages <b>168</b> and <b>170</b> within the manifold <b>156</b>. In this configuration, both liquid and air may flow into the modules <b>152</b> and ultimately to the spray devices <b>108</b>. The modules <b>152</b> also include fasteners <b>172</b> configured to secure to bolts <b>166</b>, thereby coupling the modules <b>152</b> to the manifold <b>156</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the modules <b>152</b> are arranged in two parallel rows with three modules <b>152</b> per row. In other embodiments, each row may include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more modules <b>152</b> per row depending on the size and nature of the web moistening system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an exploded top perspective view of a module <b>152</b> of the modular web moistening assembly taken within line <b>8</b>-<b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As illustrated, the hood <b>154</b> has been separated from the remainder of the module structure. The module <b>152</b> includes stand-off posts <b>174</b> configured to secure the hood <b>154</b> to the module <b>152</b> via bolts <b>176</b>. Specifically, three bolts <b>176</b> may pass through openings <b>177</b> in the hood <b>154</b> and secure to the stand-off posts <b>174</b>, thereby coupling the hood <b>154</b> to a manifold <b>178</b>. More or fewer bolts <b>176</b>, openings <b>177</b> and stand-off posts <b>174</b> may be employed in alternative embodiments. For example, the module <b>152</b> may include 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more bolts <b>176</b>, openings <b>177</b> and stand-off posts <b>174</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As previously discussed, the hood <b>154</b> may serve to protect a circuit board <b>180</b> and valves <b>182</b> from external moisture and other contaminants. As illustrated, the circuit board <b>180</b> is mounted perpendicular to the manifold <b>178</b>. In alternative configurations, the circuit board <b>180</b> may be mounted parallel and adjacent to the manifold <b>178</b> (i.e., between the manifold <b>178</b> and the valves <b>182</b>), or above the valves <b>182</b>. In the present embodiment, each valve <b>182</b> is positioned directly opposite the manifold <b>178</b> from each spray device <b>108</b>. As discussed in detail below, the manifold <b>178</b> is configured to direct a flow of liquid through each valve <b>182</b> prior to directing the liquid into the spray device <b>108</b>. Each valve <b>182</b> includes a connector <b>184</b> that may be coupled to the circuit board <b>180</b>. As previously discussed, the cable <b>150</b> may couple to the circuit board <b>180</b> to control the operation of the valves <b>182</b>. Control signals from the cable <b>150</b> may pass through the circuit board <b>180</b> to each of the valves <b>182</b> via the connectors <b>184</b>. Such an arrangement may reduce construction costs compared to providing each valve <b>182</b> with an individual electronic control unit. In certain embodiments, the connectors <b>184</b> may be configured to plug directly into the circuit board <b>180</b>. This configuration may reduce construction costs due to decreased assembly time and fewer parts (e.g., connecting wires). In addition, LEDs <b>185</b> may be mounted to the circuit board <b>180</b> to indicate the operation of each spray device <b>108</b>. For example, a control signal may direct a valve <b>182</b> to open. The circuit board <b>180</b> may include circuitry configured to detect the position of each valve <b>182</b> and illuminate an LED associated with the valve <b>182</b> to indicate valve position (e.g., lit LED indicates valve is open).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In further embodiments, the circuit board <b>180</b> may include additional circuitry configured to directly control valve operation based on input pressures or flow rates. For example, the control system <b>114</b> may output a desired liquid flow rate to each of the modules <b>152</b> via the cables <b>150</b>. Circuitry within each circuit board <b>180</b> may then adjust the liquid flow through each spray device <b>108</b> to achieve the desired flow rate. This configuration may facilitate an even distribution of liquid droplets across the web <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In certain embodiments, the manifold <b>178</b> may be composed of multiple layers. These layers may be stacked to form a complete structure including internal liquid and pneumatic passages. As illustrated, the manifold <b>178</b> includes an orientation guide <b>187</b> to ensure proper orientation (e.g., stacking) of the multiple layers. In certain embodiments, the guide <b>187</b> may be a diagonal mark <b>187</b> on one side or edge of the multiple layers. Specifically, if any layer is not in the correct order, the mark <b>187</b> may not appear as a diagonal line. This configuration may serve to ensure proper flow of air and liquid through the manifold <b>178</b>. The mark <b>187</b> may be located at any suitable position about the circumference of the manifold <b>178</b>. The mark <b>187</b> may be etched into the structure of the manifold <b>178</b> or marked on the surface. In alternative embodiments, the orientation guide <b>187</b> may include an arcuate line, a series of indents, a series of notches, or the like, wherein these indicia indicate a proper order of the layers. As discussed in detail below, a similar orientation guide may be used on multiple layers of the spray devices <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is an exploded bottom perspective view of a manifold <b>178</b> and associated spray devices <b>108</b> taken within line <b>9</b>-<b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, showing a spray device <b>108</b> removed from the manifold <b>178</b>. As illustrated, the manifold <b>178</b> includes 4 openings <b>186</b> configured to facilitate passage of bolts <b>166</b> through the manifold <b>178</b> such that the bolts <b>166</b> may couple with fasteners <b>172</b> to secure the manifold <b>178</b> to the manifold <b>156</b>. In addition, manifold <b>178</b> includes four liquid inlets <b>188</b> and two air inlets <b>190</b>. These inlets <b>188</b> and <b>190</b> are configured to provide liquid and air, respectively, to each of the spray devices <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The spray devices <b>108</b> are each secured to the manifold <b>178</b> by four bolts <b>191</b> configured to pass through the spray device <b>108</b> and secure to the manifold <b>178</b> via four corresponding bolt holes <b>192</b>. The manifold <b>178</b> also includes a liquid outlet <b>194</b> and two pneumatic outlets <b>196</b> for each spray device <b>108</b>. As discussed in detail below, each spray device <b>108</b> includes corresponding pneumatic and liquid inlets. This configuration may facilitate the passage of air and liquid from the pneumatic and liquid inlets <b>188</b> and <b>190</b>, through the pneumatic and liquid outlets <b>194</b> and <b>196</b>, to the spray devices <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As discussed in detail below, the spray devices <b>108</b> may include multiple layers secured together by the bolts <b>191</b>. However, these layers may be pre-assembled prior to delivery to a customer. For example, if a spray device <b>108</b> is not functioning properly, it may be removed for maintenance. However, once the bolts <b>191</b> are removed the layers may separate from one another, thereby increasing the possibility that the layers may be reassembled in an incorrect order. Therefore, each spray device <b>108</b> may include one or more bolts or rivets that secure the layers together. This configuration may facilitate enhanced removal and attachment of spray devices <b>108</b>. In certain embodiments, the securing bolt or rivet may be located in a corner of the spray device <b>108</b> such that each layer may rotate with respect to the next. In such a configuration, passages within the spray device <b>108</b> may be cleaned without creating a possibility that the layers may be reordered.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Furthermore, as illustrated, the spray devices <b>108</b> are secured below the manifold <b>178</b> (i.e., along the direction of travel of the web <b>102</b>). This configuration reduces the possibility that dirt and/or other contaminants may clog passages within the spray devices <b>108</b> during operation and/or while removing and reinstalling spray devices <b>108</b>. For example, due to high web speeds, contaminants attached to the web <b>102</b> may be dislodged and impact the modules <b>152</b>. However, because the spray devices <b>108</b> are positioned below the manifold <b>178</b>, any debris from the web <b>102</b> may be deposited on an opposite surface from the spray devices <b>108</b>. This configuration may increase the time between maintenance cycles, thereby reducing the operational costs associated with the web moistening system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an exploded view of a manifold <b>178</b>, showing individual layers that comprise flow paths within the manifold <b>178</b>. Specifically, manifold <b>178</b> includes a first layer <b>198</b>, a second layer <b>200</b>, a third layer <b>202</b>, a fourth layer <b>204</b> and a fifth layer <b>206</b>. The first layer <b>198</b> corresponds to the portion of the manifold <b>178</b> coupled to the spray devices <b>108</b>, while the fifth layer <b>206</b> corresponds to the portion coupled to the valves <b>182</b>. As previously discussed, the first layer <b>198</b> includes bolt holes <b>186</b> configured to couple the manifold <b>178</b> to the manifold <b>156</b>. The first layer <b>198</b> also includes liquid inlets <b>188</b> and pneumatic inlets <b>190</b>, configured to receive air and liquid from the manifold <b>156</b>. Furthermore, the first layer <b>198</b> includes liquid outlets <b>194</b> and pneumatic outlets <b>196</b> configured to provide the spray devices <b>108</b> with liquid and air, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As illustrated, the bolt holes <b>186</b> extend through each layer <b>198</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>. This configuration enables the bolts <b>166</b> to pass through the entire manifold <b>178</b> and engage the fasteners <b>172</b>. Liquid entering liquid orifices <b>188</b> may pass through liquid passages <b>208</b> in the second layer <b>200</b>. Similarly, air from the pneumatic orifices <b>190</b> may pass through pneumatic passages <b>210</b>. As illustrated, the diameter of the liquid passages <b>208</b> is smaller than the diameter of the liquid inlets <b>188</b>, and the diameter of the pneumatic passages <b>210</b> is smaller than the diameter of the pneumatic inlets <b>190</b>. The difference in diameters may facilitate insertion of O-rings within the liquid passages <b>208</b> and/or the pneumatic passages <b>210</b>, thereby providing a seal between the manifold <b>178</b> and the manifold <b>156</b>. In alternative embodiments, diameters of the passages <b>208</b> and/or <b>210</b> may be substantially the same or larger than the diameters of the respective inlets <b>188</b> and/or <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The air and liquid may then pass into passages within the third layer <b>202</b>. Specifically, the third layer <b>202</b> includes liquid passages <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>, and pneumatic passages <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> that extend within the plane of the layer <b>202</b>. Liquid from the liquid passage <b>208</b> may enter a first planar liquid passage <b>212</b>. As illustrated, the width of the first planar liquid passage <b>212</b> is smaller than the diameter of the liquid passage <b>208</b>. As appreciated, alternative embodiments may employ a liquid passage <b>212</b> having a width substantially similar to or greater than the diameter of liquid passage <b>208</b>. A second planar liquid passage <b>214</b> and a third planar liquid passage <b>216</b> branch off from the first planar liquid passage <b>212</b>. In this configuration, substantially equal quantities of liquid may be directed to each passage <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>. Furthermore, liquid passing through liquid passage <b>214</b> flows into a smaller width planar liquid passage <b>218</b>, while liquid passing through liquid passage <b>216</b> flows into a smaller width planar liquid passage <b>220</b>. The width of passages <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> may be configured to facilitate proper liquid flow into each spray device <b>108</b>. In other words, the passages <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> may ensure a substantially equal pressure drop between each spray device, each module <b>152</b> and generally across the web moistening system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In a similar arrangement, air from the air passage <b>210</b> flows into the planar air passage <b>224</b> in the third layer <b>202</b>. The air flow is then split between two planar air passages <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> that extend in a substantially perpendicular direction to the air passage <b>224</b>. As illustrated, the width of the branched passages <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> is smaller than the width of the air passage <b>224</b>. This configuration may establish a substantially even air flow to each of the spray devices <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Returning to the liquid flow path, liquid from planar liquid passages <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> may flow through liquid passages <b>230</b> in the fourth layer <b>204</b> and exit the manifold <b>178</b> through liquid outlets <b>232</b> in the fifth layer <b>206</b>. As illustrated, the diameters of the liquid passages <b>230</b> and the liquid outlets <b>232</b> are substantially similar to the widths of the planar liquid passages <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>. Alternative embodiments may include liquid passages <b>230</b> and/or liquid outlets <b>232</b> having smaller or larger diameters than the widths of the liquid passages <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, valves <b>182</b> are disposed on the manifold <b>178</b> adjacent to the fifth layer <b>206</b>. Specifically, one valve is positioned directly adjacent to each liquid outlet <b>232</b>. In this configuration, liquid exiting the manifold <b>178</b> through liquid outlet <b>232</b> may enter the valve <b>182</b>. If the valve <b>182</b> is in a closed positioned, the path of the liquid terminates at the valve. However, if the valve <b>182</b> is in an open position, liquid may pass through the valve <b>182</b> and reenter the manifold <b>178</b> through a liquid inlet <b>234</b>, also disposed adjacent to the valve <b>182</b>. The liquid may then flow through a liquid passage <b>236</b> in the fourth layer <b>204</b> and enter a planar liquid passage <b>238</b> in the third layer <b>202</b>. Finally, the liquid may pass through a liquid passage <b>240</b> in the second layer <b>200</b> before exiting the manifold <b>178</b> through the liquid outlet <b>194</b>. As illustrated, the diameter of the liquid passage <b>240</b> may be substantially smaller than the width of the planar liquid passage <b>238</b>. This configuration may serve to maintain a substantially even pressure drop across the manifold, while supplying a proper quantity of liquid to the spray devices <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In contrast to the liquid flow path, air from the two planar air passages <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> may be directed back to the second layer <b>200</b>. Specifically, because the fourth layer <b>204</b> does not include pneumatic passages, air flow may be restricted to layers <b>198</b>, <b>200</b> and <b>202</b>. Therefore, air from the passages <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> may flow through air passages <b>242</b> within the second layer <b>200</b> and exit the manifold <b>178</b> through the pneumatic orifices <b>196</b>. Similar to the liquid configuration, the diameter of the passages <b>242</b> may be configured to maintain a substantially even pressure drop across the manifold, while supplying a proper quantity of air to the spray devices <b>108</b>. As appreciated, the thickness of each layer may be configured to establish a suitable flow of air and liquid through the manifold <b>178</b>. Furthermore, each illustrated layer may be representative of multiple layers. For example, in certain embodiments, layer <b>202</b> may include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more layers to establish an appropriate thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The arrangement of air and liquid passages described above may be configured to provide a substantially equal air and liquid pressure to each spray device <b>108</b>, thus establishing an even flow of water droplets across the web <b>102</b>. As previously discussed, the layers <b>198</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> may be composed of aluminum or stainless steel, and secured together by bolts <b>166</b>. Alternative configurations may employ plastic layers that may be laser welded together to form the manifold <b>178</b>. For example, the layers may be composed of a plastic that is semi-transparent to infrared radiation. After the layers are aligned, an infrared laser may project a beam into the layers, inducing the layers to fuse together. Such a configuration may provide reduced construction costs compared to aluminum or stainless steel layers, while providing enhanced sealing between layers. This enhanced sealing may enable higher pressure operation compared to bolted layers. Alternatively, aluminum, composite or stainless steel layers may be sealed using various welding, soldering, brazing, diffusion bonding, or adhesion techniques (e.g., via adhesives). Thus, the layered construction of the manifolds <b>178</b> may include one or more material bonds along seams between the layers. The material bonds may be along edges, faces, or both, of the adjacent layers. As appreciated, in addition to the multi-layered assembly described above, other embodiments of the manifold <b>178</b> may be constructed using alternative techniques. For example, the manifold <b>178</b> may be machined from solid blocks of material.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a top view of three spray devices <b>108</b> that may be employed in the present embodiment. As illustrated, each spray device <b>108</b> may project a fan-shaped droplet pattern <b>304</b> from a liquid orifice <b>302</b>. The fan-shaped droplet pattern <b>304</b> may be substantially flat and oriented in a direction perpendicular to the direction of travel of the web. The liquid streams <b>304</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> overlap each other as they expand, thereby providing substantially uniform water distribution across the web. In other embodiments, the spacing of the spray devices <b>108</b> and/or the angle of each fan-shaped droplet pattern <b>304</b> may be varied to alter the amount of overlap. Adjustment of these parameters may be based on a desired level of web moistening.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a perspective view of a spray device <b>108</b> having a unique atomization mechanism in accordance with certain embodiments of the invention. As discussed in detail below, the spray device <b>108</b> may be composed of layers, with each layer bolted together to form a complete apparatus. In the present embodiment, spray device <b>108</b> includes an orientation guide <b>401</b> to ensure proper orientation (e.g., stacking) of the multiple layers. In certain embodiments, the guide <b>401</b> may be a diagonal mark <b>401</b> on one side. Specifically, if any layer is not in the correct order, the mark <b>401</b> may not appear as a diagonal line. This configuration may serve to ensure proper flow of air and liquid through the spray device <b>108</b>. The mark <b>401</b> may be located at any suitable position about the circumference of the spray device <b>108</b>. The mark <b>401</b> may be etched into the structure of the spray device <b>108</b> or marked on the surface. In alternative embodiments, the orientation guide <b>401</b> may include an arcuate line, a series of indents, a series of notches, or the like, wherein these indicia indicate a proper order of the layers. After the layers have been properly aligned (i.e., a diagonal line is visible), bolts may pass through holes <b>402</b> to secure the layers. These bolt holes <b>402</b> may pass through the entire spray device <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A liquid inlet <b>404</b> may serve to deliver liquid from the liquid supply <b>112</b> to the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. Similarly, pneumatic inlets <b>406</b> may facilitate gas flow from the pneumatic supply <b>110</b> through the spray device <b>108</b> to pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Both the liquid orifice <b>302</b> and the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> are components of the nozzle <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Liquid exiting the liquid orifice <b>302</b> may be separated into droplets by pneumatic atomization. The liquid orifice <b>302</b> may emit liquid at a relatively low flow rate, while the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may expel gas at a relatively high flow rate. Interaction between the high flow rate gas and the low flow rate liquid may cause the liquid to break up into droplets. Furthermore, some of the energy from the gas may be transferred to the liquid, increasing liquid droplet velocity. Because droplet velocity is a function of gas flow rate, pneumatic atomization may produce high velocity droplets while maintaining a low liquid flow rate. In other words, pneumatic atomizers may vary droplet velocity independently of the liquid flow rate. This configuration, unattainable with hydraulic atomization, may be well-suited for web moistening where greater droplet velocity and lower liquid flow rates are desired.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the liquid droplets emitted from liquid orifice <b>302</b> form a substantially flat fan-shaped pattern <b>304</b>. This pattern <b>304</b> may include vacillating droplets established by gas streams emanating between the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Specifically, two gas streams emanating from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may converge near the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. These high velocity gas stream may induce a liquid stream emitted from liquid orifice <b>302</b> to form vacillating droplets. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows an exemplary droplet <b>412</b> as it vacillates in space between boundaries <b>414</b>. This droplet <b>412</b> is merely representative of droplets formed through the pneumatic atomization process. The frequency and amplitude of this vacillation may be controlled by varying the liquid and/or gas flow rates, the liquid and/or gas velocities, and/or the spacing between the liquid orifice <b>302</b> and the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Adjusting the parameters of droplet vacillation is described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,540, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Droplet vacillation may not be visible in the fan-shaped streams <b>304</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> because each droplet may vacillate at a high frequency. A combination of this high frequency vacillation and a large number of droplets may create the appearance of the relatively flat fan-shaped droplet pattern <b>304</b>. The particular fan-shaped pattern <b>304</b> created by this vacillation may result in uniform web moistening.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The flow rates of both liquid and gas are particularly adjusted to maintain the fan-shaped droplet pattern <b>304</b>. Specifically, if the gas flow rate is too high relative to the liquid flow rate, liquid droplets may not properly vacillate to form the fan spray pattern <b>304</b>. Without proper vacillation, the flattened fan-shaped pattern <b>304</b> may rotate approximately 90&#xb0;, resulting in ineffective web moistening due to uneven liquid distribution across the web. For example, in certain embodiments, the liquid flow rate may be about 2 to 100, 5 to 70, 10 to 50, or approximately 10 to 30 cubic centimeters per minute. For example, if the liquid flow rate is approximately 10 to 30 cubic centimeters per minute, a gas flow rate of about 1 to 20, 2 to 10, or approximately 2 to 5 standard cubic feet per hour may produce proper droplet vacillation.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The liquid orifice <b>302</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> protrudes from the front face of the spray device <b>108</b> such that the liquid orifice <b>302</b> is positioned downstream from the gas flow of pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. As illustrated, the protrusion is both rectangular and tapered. Alternative embodiments may employ a liquid orifice <b>302</b> having a non-tapered protrusion and/or a non-rectangular configuration. For example, in certain embodiments, the protrusion may have a circular, elliptical or triangular cross-section. This protrusion may facilitate automatic unclogging of the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. A portion of the gas emitted from each pneumatic orifice <b>408</b> may pass over the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. In this configuration, if an object or liquid on the surface obstructs the flow of liquid, the gas flow may dislodge it.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic diagram of a front view of the nozzle <b>410</b> component of the spray device <b>108</b>. The nozzle <b>410</b> depicted in this figure contains a rectangular liquid orifice <b>302</b> and rectangular pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Experimentation has determined that rectangular orifices may produce effective spray patterns for web moistening. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows that the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> are longer than the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. In particular, pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> have a length <b>409</b>, whereas liquid orifice <b>302</b> has a length <b>303</b>. In certain embodiments, length <b>409</b> may be at least 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more times length <b>303</b>. For example, length <b>409</b> may be more than approximately 20 percent longer than length <b>303</b>. Furthermore, liquid orifice <b>302</b> may be positioned such that pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> extend past opposite ends of liquid orifice <b>302</b> along a vertical axis <b>411</b>. This overlapping, or sandwich, configuration may reduce tails by confining liquid droplets to the plane of the fan-shaped stream. Tails are undesirable components of a spray pattern that are formed when a small number of droplets travel outside of the desired flow pattern. Confining these droplets to the fan-shaped stream may provide a more uniform liquid distribution across the web <b>102</b>. Alternative embodiments may employ pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> that extend past only one end of liquid orifice <b>302</b> along the vertical axis <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Dimensions of both the liquid orifice <b>302</b> and the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may be varied based on the desired liquid spray configuration. For example, if a greater gas velocity is desired, the size of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may be reduced. In addition, larger droplets may be formed by increasing the size of the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. However, as previously discussed, the disclosed embodiments may maintain the rectangular shape of orifices <b>302</b> and <b>408</b>, where the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> are longer than the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. Therefore, a width <b>415</b> of liquid orifice <b>302</b> and a width <b>417</b> of pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may be varied to adjust the size of orifices <b>302</b> and <b>408</b>, respectively. In the present embodiment, the width <b>415</b> of liquid orifice <b>302</b> is substantially similar to the width <b>417</b> of pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. However, widths <b>415</b> and <b>417</b> may vary in alternative embodiments. In addition, the length <b>303</b> of liquid orifice <b>302</b> may be approximately two times the width <b>415</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Alternatively, the length <b>303</b> may be about 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 or more times the width <b>415</b> of liquid orifice <b>302</b>, for example. Similarly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the length <b>409</b> of pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may be four times the width <b>417</b>. In alternative embodiments, the length <b>409</b> may be about 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5 or more times the width <b>417</b> of pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Furthermore, orifice spacing may be varied to alter the frequency and/or amplitude of droplet vacillation, for example. As illustrated, pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> are spaced a distance <b>419</b> from liquid orifice <b>302</b> along lateral axis <b>413</b>. As presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, spacing <b>419</b> is approximately 1.5 times the width <b>415</b> of liquid orifice <b>302</b>. In alternative embodiments, the spacing <b>419</b> may be about 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 or more times the width <b>415</b> of liquid orifice <b>302</b>. Further embodiments may enhance droplet formation by minimizing the spacing around liquid orifice <b>302</b>, such that spacing <b>419</b> approaches zero. By adjusting dimensions of nozzle components, spray patterns may be configured for particular applications.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">One advantage of the present embodiment is that the liquid orifice <b>302</b> may be larger than the liquid orifice of a hydraulic atomizer. Hydraulic atomizers generally require a small liquid orifice to sufficiently accelerate the liquid linearly and/or rotationally such that it atomizes. In contrast, pneumatic atomizers use gas flow to atomize liquid. Therefore, a larger liquid orifice <b>302</b> may be employed. Larger liquid orifices may be less prone to clogging because small particles may simply pass through instead of becoming lodged and obstructing liquid flow. Because the liquid orifice <b>302</b> may be able to accommodate particles in the liquid, tap water may be used as the moistening liquid, instead of the more expensive de-ionized water typically utilized in hydraulic atomizers. In addition, the larger liquid orifice <b>302</b> may facilitate spraying other liquids, including silicone and lotion, that may induce clogging and/or be too viscous to flow through the smaller orifice of a hydraulic atomizer.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Furthermore, pneumatic atomization may utilize substantially less water than hydraulic atomization, thereby reducing operational costs. Specifically, to achieve proper atomization using a hydraulic system, a high water flow rate may be utilized. For example, a flow rate of approximately 1 liter per hour through each nozzle may be employed to achieve proper droplet formation via hydraulic atomization. However, desired flow rates may be significantly less than 1 liter per hour for proper web moistening. Therefore, a shield may be partially disposed within the spray pattern to block a portion of the liquid from contacting the web <b>102</b>. For example, if a flow rate of 0.3 liters per hour is desired, the shield may redirect 0.7 liters per hour. Because the redirected water may not be recovered and reused, 0.7 liter per hour of water may be wasted for each nozzle. In contrast, because pneumatic atomization utilizes air flow to achieve proper atomization, liquid flow rates may be decreased without adversely affecting droplet formation. For example, pneumatic atomization may enable the web moistening system <b>100</b> to vary flow rates between approximately 0.1 to 3.0, 0.2 to 2.5, or 0.3 to 2.0 liters per hour for each spray device <b>108</b>. In other words, the web moistening system <b>100</b> in the present embodiment may include a flow rate ratio (minimum to maximum) of approximately 1:20.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Moreover, pneumatic atomization may facilitate increased droplet size compared to hydraulic atomization, thereby further reducing water consumption. For example, hydraulic atomizers may produce droplets between approximately 20 to 100 microns in diameter. In contrast, pneumatic atomizers may produce droplets between approximately 100 to 1000, 200 to 800, or 300 to 500 microns in diameter. The larger droplets may experience less evaporation as they travel from the spray device <b>108</b> to the web <b>102</b>. Specifically, for a given quantity of water, larger droplets yield a smaller total surface area than smaller droplets because fewer larger droplets are formed. As appreciated, evaporation rate is dependent on surface area. Therefore, larger droplets may experience less evaporation, thereby reducing the quantity of water emanated from the spray devices <b>108</b> to achieve a desired web moisture content. In addition, larger droplets may result in a greater deposition efficiency compared to smaller droplets because the larger droplets may penetrate farther into the web <b>102</b>. In certain embodiments, deposition efficiency may increase between approximately 20% to 50%. Finally, water consumption may be reduced because a greater percentage of the larger droplets may overcome the web boundary layer. As appreciated, due to high web speeds through the system <b>100</b>, the web <b>102</b> may develop a boundary layer that may redirect the flow of droplets away from the web <b>102</b>. Due to the greater mass associated with larger droplets, more droplets may overcome this boundary layer and contact the web <b>102</b>. The combination of the mechanisms described above may decrease water consumption, thereby reducing operating costs.</p>

As previously discussed, the spray device <b>108</b> may be formed from multiple layers of material. All of the layers, <b>602</b> through <b>614</b>, for one embodiment are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref> show a top view of the individual layers. As discussed in detail below, gas and liquid enter the spray device <b>108</b> along the vertical axis <b>411</b> generally perpendicular to layers <b>602</b> through <b>614</b>. The spray device <b>108</b> then expels the gas and liquid in a plane defined by a horizontal axis <b>617</b> and lateral axis <b>413</b>, generally in the plane of layers <b>602</b> through <b>614</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Layer <b>602</b> is the top layer of the spray device <b>108</b>. A top view of this layer may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As illustrated, liquid from the liquid supply <b>112</b> may enter the liquid inlet <b>404</b> along vertical axis <b>411</b>. Similarly, gas from the pneumatic supply <b>110</b> may enter pneumatic inlets <b>406</b> along vertical axis <b>411</b>. As previously discussed, layer <b>602</b> includes bolt holes <b>402</b> configured to facilitate securing layers <b>602</b> through <b>614</b> together with bolts.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A top view of the second layer <b>604</b> may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. This layer contains a vertical liquid conduit <b>616</b> which may facilitate liquid flow from the liquid inlet <b>404</b> to the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. Similarly, two vertical pneumatic conduits <b>618</b> are located in layer <b>604</b>. These conduits enable gas to travel through the spray device to the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. The vertical pneumatic conduits <b>618</b> are configured to control gas flow under a given pressure drop. Specifically, smaller conduit size reduces gas consumption under the same pressure drop. As can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, a diameter <b>619</b> of the vertical pneumatic conduits <b>618</b> is smaller than a diameter <b>407</b> of the pneumatic inlets <b>406</b>. For example, the diameter <b>407</b> may be more than approximately 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, or more times the diameter <b>619</b>. Furthermore, a diameter <b>405</b> of the liquid inlet <b>404</b> may be substantially similar to or larger than a diameter <b>621</b> of the vertical liquid conduit <b>616</b>. However, the diameter and shape of the vertical conduits <b>616</b> and <b>618</b> within this layer may be varied in alternative embodiments based on desired flow properties.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> depicts a top view of the third layer <b>606</b>. This layer includes another section of the vertical liquid conduit <b>616</b>. Layer <b>606</b> also contains two horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b> which redirect gas from the vertical pneumatic conduits <b>618</b> to the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an initial width <b>623</b> of the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b> is substantially similar to the diameter <b>619</b> of the vertical pneumatic conduits <b>618</b>. However, the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b> narrow as they approach the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Specifically, width decreases from the initial width <b>623</b> to a width <b>417</b> at the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. For example, the width <b>623</b> may be more than about 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 or more times the width <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A top view of the fourth layer <b>608</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. This layer contains the two horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>, as seen in layer <b>606</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). In addition, layer <b>608</b> contains a horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b> that transfers liquid from the vertical liquid conduit <b>616</b> to the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, an initial width <b>627</b> of the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b> is substantially the same as the diameter <b>621</b> of the vertical liquid conduit <b>616</b>. Furthermore, the width of the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b> progressively decreases to correspond to a width <b>415</b> of the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. As with the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>, the configuration of the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b> affects liquid flow properties.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> also depicts an angle, &#x3b1;, between each horizontal pneumatic conduit <b>620</b> and the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b>. This angle may be adjusted between approximately 0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0;. For example, in certain embodiments, &#x3b1; is about 10&#xb0;, 20&#xb0;, 30&#xb0;, 40&#xb0;, 50&#xb0;, 60&#xb0;, 70&#xb0; or 80&#xb0;, or an angle therebetween. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, &#x3b1; is approximately 10&#xb0;. Experimentation has determined that an angle &#x3b1; of approximately 30&#xb0; may be well-suited for certain web moistening applications. Varying &#x3b1; may affect both the configuration of the fan-shaped stream and the ability of the gas streams to dislodge obstructions in the liquid orifice <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As previously discussed, liquid orifice <b>302</b> may protrude in a downstream direction from the gas flow of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. As illustrated, liquid orifice <b>302</b> is positioned a distance <b>625</b> from the face of spray device <b>108</b>. In certain embodiments, distance <b>625</b> may be approximately 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more times the width <b>415</b> of liquid orifice <b>302</b>. As described above, the protrusion of liquid orifice <b>302</b> is tapered at an angle &#x3b1; and has a generally rectangular shape. Positioning the liquid orifice <b>302</b> downstream from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may serve to dislodge obstructions in the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. However, in alternative embodiments, liquid orifice <b>302</b> may be positioned substantially flush with the face of spray device <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Layer <b>610</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, is substantially similar to layer <b>606</b>, and layer <b>612</b> is substantially similar to layer <b>604</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the top and bottom of the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b> is formed by layers <b>606</b> and <b>610</b>, respectively. In other words, liquid flowing through the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b> is confined to a path through layer <b>608</b>. Therefore, the length <b>303</b> of the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b>, and liquid orifice <b>302</b>, along vertical axis <b>411</b> is equal to a thickness <b>609</b> of layer <b>608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In addition, layers <b>604</b> and <b>612</b> serve to confine the flow of gas to the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>. Unlike the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b>, the length <b>409</b> of horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>, and pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>, along vertical axis <b>411</b> is equal to the thickness <b>609</b> of layer <b>608</b> combined with thicknesses <b>611</b> of layers <b>606</b> and <b>610</b>. As a result of this layering, the length <b>409</b> of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> is greater than the length <b>303</b> of the liquid orifice <b>302</b>. Layer <b>612</b> serves to provide symmetry to the spray device <b>108</b> between layers <b>604</b> and <b>612</b>. In this configuration, layers <b>604</b> to <b>612</b>, as a stack, may be rotated 180 degrees about horizontal axis <b>617</b> and sandwiched between layers <b>602</b> and <b>614</b>. Alternative embodiments may omit layer <b>612</b> such that layer <b>614</b> serves to confine the flow of gas to the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The final layer of the spray device <b>108</b> is layer <b>614</b>. This layer serves as an end cap for both the vertical pneumatic conduits <b>618</b> and the vertical liquid conduit <b>616</b>. By capping these conduits, both gas and liquid are forced to exit their respective orifices. The layered configuration described above may enable the spray devices <b>108</b> to be reconfigured for varying droplet sizes and/or spray patterns by replacing individual layers. Furthermore, as appreciated, in addition to the multi-layered assembly described above, other embodiments of the spray device <b>108</b> may be constructed using alternative techniques. For example, the spray device <b>108</b> may be machined and/or molded from solid blocks of material.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref> represent an alternative embodiment of spray nozzle <b>108</b> that is configured to reduce a buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may accumulate adjacent to pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> during operation of the spray device <b>108</b>. For example, the liquid supply <b>112</b> may provide the spray device <b>108</b> with &#x201c;softened&#x201d; water. Softened water is formed by passing tap water, for example, through a reverse-osmosis filter. However, this process may add small amounts of salt to the water. During operation of the web moistening system <b>100</b>, liquid droplets from the liquid orifice <b>302</b> may impact various regions of the spray device <b>108</b>, including areas adjacent to pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. As these droplets evaporate, salt and/or other minerals within the water may be deposited within the flow path of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Over time, these deposits may accumulate, eventually interfering with gas flow and resulting in a non-uniform spray pattern. The alternative embodiment described below is configured to reduce the buildup of salt and/or other minerals within the flow path of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a top view of an alternative embodiment of a third layer <b>702</b> of the spray device <b>108</b>. Layer <b>702</b> may replace layer <b>606</b> of the embodiment described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>. Layer <b>702</b> includes certain features configured to reduce a buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may accumulate within the flow path of pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> during operation of the spray device <b>108</b>. Specifically, layer <b>702</b> includes a point <b>703</b> forming an angle <b>704</b> and a curved portion <b>705</b> having a depth <b>706</b> and a width <b>708</b>. As discussed in detail below, the curved portion <b>705</b> is configured to direct a flow of gas toward the point <b>703</b> such that water droplets impact the point <b>703</b> and/or are redirected away from the spray device <b>108</b>. Any salt and/or mineral buildup on the point <b>703</b> may be dislodged by gas flow and/or vibration of the spray device <b>108</b>. In this manner, salt and/or mineral buildup within the flow path of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The angle <b>704</b> of the point <b>703</b> relative to the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b> is configured to provide a reduced surface area for the accumulation of salt and/or other minerals. As appreciated, deposits may be extricated from a smaller surface area with a reduced force. Therefore, the sharper the point <b>703</b>, the more likely a given force may dislodge the mineral buildup. Consequently, force provided by gas flow from the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b> may remove salt and/or other minerals from the point <b>703</b> due to the reduced surface area. For example, in certain embodiments, the angle <b>704</b> may be less than approximately 30&#xb0;. Alternative embodiments may include angles <b>704</b> from 0&#xb0; to 45&#xb0;, 2&#xb0; to 40&#xb0;, 4&#xb0; to 35&#xb0;, 6&#xb0; to 30&#xb0;, 8&#xb0; to 25&#xb0;, 10&#xb0; to 20&#xb0;, and 12&#xb0; to 15&#xb0;, for example. Further embodiments may include angles <b>704</b> less than about 30&#xb0;, 25&#xb0;, 20&#xb0;, 15&#xb0;, 12&#xb0;, 10&#xb0;, 8&#xb0;, 6&#xb0;, 4&#xb0;, or 2&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Furthermore, the curved portion <b>705</b> is configured to redirect a flow of gas toward the point <b>703</b> and/or in a direction away from the spray device <b>108</b> (i.e., in the downstream direction). Specifically, the depth <b>706</b> of the curved portion <b>705</b> may be approximately two times the width <b>417</b> of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Further embodiments may include a depth <b>706</b> of greater than approximately 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more times the width <b>417</b>. The width <b>708</b> of the curved portion <b>705</b> may be approximately seven times the width <b>417</b> of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Further embodiments may include a width <b>708</b> of greater than approximately 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 or more times the width <b>417</b>.</p>

As illustrated, the point <b>703</b> and the curve portion <b>705</b> are substantially similar to the point <b>703</b> and curved portion <b>705</b> of layer <b>702</b>. Therefore, a thickness of the point <b>703</b> and the curved portion <b>705</b> is at least partially defined by the thickness of layers <b>702</b> and <b>710</b>. In alternative embodiments, the angle <b>704</b> of the point <b>703</b> and/or the depth <b>706</b> and/or the width <b>708</b> of the curved portion <b>705</b> may vary between layers <b>702</b> and <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As illustrated, layer <b>710</b> includes a first pneumatic passage <b>620</b> extending directly along the liquid passage <b>622</b> to a first pneumatic orifice <b>408</b> disposed between a first surface <b>707</b> and a second surface <b>709</b>. The second surface <b>709</b> includes the point <b>703</b> and the curved portion <b>705</b> configured to reduce salt and/or other mineral buildup along the flow path of the first pneumatic orifice <b>408</b>. Specifically, the curved portion <b>705</b> forms a C-shape, U-shape, concave recess or curved recess within the second surface <b>709</b> and extends to the first pneumatic passage <b>620</b>. In other words, the curved portion <b>705</b> is directly adjacent to the first pneumatic orifice <b>408</b>. The interface between the curved portion <b>705</b> and the first pneumatic passage <b>620</b> forms the point <b>703</b>.

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In certain configurations, an alternative embodiment of the fifth layer may be included. The alternative fifth layer may be substantially similar to layer <b>702</b>. Layers <b>702</b>, <b>710</b> and the alternative fifth layer may be sandwiched between layers <b>604</b> and <b>612</b> of the spray device <b>108</b> presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Thus, the thickness of the expansion portion <b>703</b> may be defined by the combined thicknesses of the layers <b>702</b>, <b>710</b> and the fifth layer. In this configuration, the alternative embodiment may function in a similar manner to the previously described embodiment, while limiting buildup of salt and/or other minerals in the flow path of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a detailed top view of liquid orifice <b>302</b> and pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> of the alternative embodiment of the fourth layer <b>710</b>, showing the flow path of gas (e.g., air) around the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. As previously described, the point <b>703</b> and the curved portion <b>705</b> are configured to reduce the buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may interfere with the flow of gas from pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. As illustrated, gas emitted from pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may flow in a downstream direction <b>712</b>. As appreciated, the flowing gas may establish a region of low pressure, drawing surrounding air toward the flow. The curved portion <b>705</b> is configured to direct the air flow toward the point <b>703</b>. Specifically, the curved portion <b>705</b> converges with an inner surface of the horizontal pneumatic conduit <b>620</b> in the downstream direction, thereby forming the point <b>703</b> and directing air along the surface of the curved portion <b>705</b> in a direction <b>714</b>. Water droplets may be captured by the air flow and directed toward the point <b>703</b>. A portion of the water droplets may adhere to the point <b>703</b>, while other droplets remain in the air flow. Over time, the droplets that adhere to the point <b>703</b> may evaporate, causing an accumulation of salt and/or other minerals on the point <b>703</b>, as represented by buildup <b>716</b>. However, due to the small surface area associated with the point <b>703</b>, air flow from the surface of the curved portion <b>705</b> and/or gas flow from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may dislodge the buildup <b>716</b> from the point <b>703</b>. Specifically, the flows may apply a shear force along the point <b>703</b> in a direction away from the spray device <b>108</b>. As previously discussed, the small surface area of the point <b>703</b> increases the likelihood that a given flow pressure may dislodge the buildup <b>716</b>. Therefore, the flows may remove the buildup <b>716</b> from the point <b>703</b> and carry it in a downstream direction <b>712</b>. In addition, the spray device <b>108</b> may vibrate during operation, providing an additional force to extricate the buildup <b>716</b>. Therefore, the quantity of salt and/or other minerals deposited adjacent to the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition, buildup <b>716</b> on the point <b>703</b> may be further reduced because a portion of the water droplets captured by the air flow along the surface of the curved portion <b>705</b> may remain in the air flow. As illustrated, water droplets captured by air flowing in direction <b>714</b> may bypass the point <b>703</b> and flow in a direction <b>718</b>. For example, more than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% of the water droplets may remain in the flow. Because some of the water droplets do not adhere to the point <b>703</b>, less buildup <b>716</b> may be formed. In certain embodiments, the direction <b>718</b> may be substantially similar to the downstream direction <b>712</b> of the gas flow from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. In this configuration, the air flow from the curved portion <b>705</b> may combine with the gas flow from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. In addition, a portion of the air and/or gas flow may return to the curved portion <b>705</b>, thus establishing a recirculating flow in direction <b>714</b>. The combination of directing water droplets away from the spray device <b>108</b> and the small surface area of the point <b>703</b> may reduce salt and/or mineral buildup that may interfere with gas flow from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>, thereby maintaining a substantially uniform spray pattern <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref> represent an second alternative embodiment of spray nozzle <b>108</b> that is configured to reduce a buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may accumulate adjacent to pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> during operation of the spray device <b>108</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a top view of an alternative embodiment of a third layer <b>802</b> of the spray device <b>108</b>. Layer <b>802</b> may replace layer <b>606</b> of the embodiment described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>. Layer <b>802</b> includes certain features configured to reduce a buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may form adjacent to pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> during operation of the spray device <b>108</b>. Specifically, layer <b>802</b> includes an expansion portion <b>803</b> within each horizontal pneumatic conduit <b>620</b>, forming recesses within an exit surface <b>805</b>. The expansion portions <b>803</b> are configured to induce recirculation within the recesses and/or adjacent to the exit surface <b>805</b>. As discussed in detail below, recirculation within the expansion portion <b>803</b> may deposit salt and/or other minerals outside of the flow path of gas emitted from horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>. In addition, recirculation adjacent to the exit surface <b>805</b> may deposit salt and/or other minerals on a point or angled tip of the expansion portion <b>803</b> having a small surface area. Air flow and/or vibrations of the spray device <b>108</b> may dislodge the deposits from the point, thereby reducing buildup within the flow path of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As illustrated, the expansion portion <b>803</b> has a depth <b>804</b> and a width <b>806</b> configured to induce recirculation within the expansion portion <b>803</b>. In the present embodiment, the depth <b>804</b> is approximately 3 times the width <b>417</b> of the pneumatic orifice <b>408</b>. Alternative embodiments may include a depth <b>804</b> of greater than approximately 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more times the width <b>417</b>. Furthermore, the width <b>806</b> is approximately 2 times the width <b>417</b> of the pneumatic orifice <b>408</b>. Alternative embodiments may include a width <b>806</b> of greater than approximately 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or more times the width <b>417</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The illustrated embodiment includes a substantially rectangular expansion portion <b>803</b>. Further embodiments may include alternative configurations such as substantially circular, triangular, elliptical or polygonal, among other configurations. In addition, the expansion portion <b>803</b> forms a point <b>808</b> along the exit surface <b>805</b> of the spray device <b>108</b>. The point <b>808</b> is configured to provide a reduced surface area for the accumulation of salt and/or other minerals. As appreciated, deposits may be extricated from a smaller surface area with a reduced force. Therefore, the sharper the point <b>808</b>, the more likely a given force may dislodge the mineral buildup. Consequently, force provided by gas flow from the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b> may remove salt and/or other minerals from the point <b>808</b> due to the reduced surface area.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a top view of an alternative embodiment of a fourth layer <b>810</b> of the spray device <b>108</b>. Layer <b>810</b> may replace layer <b>608</b> of the embodiment described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>. As illustrated, the depth <b>804</b> and the width <b>806</b> are substantially similar to the depth <b>804</b> and the width <b>806</b> of layer <b>802</b>. In addition, the thickness of the expansion portion <b>803</b> is at least partially defined by the thickness of layers <b>802</b> and <b>810</b>. In alternative embodiments, the depth <b>804</b>, the width <b>806</b> and/or the geometric configuration of the expansion portion <b>803</b> may vary between layers <b>802</b> and <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The point <b>808</b> represents an exterior angled tip at an interface of the exit surface <b>805</b> and an interior wall <b>812</b> of the expansion portion <b>803</b>. As illustrated, the interior wall <b>812</b> extends toward the point <b>808</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the horizontal pneumatic conduit <b>620</b>. The intersection between the interior wall <b>812</b> and the exit surface <b>805</b> forms the point <b>808</b> which may also be considered an angled projection, external peak, or angled tip. As appreciated, an angle <b>814</b> of the point <b>808</b> may be varied by adjusting the geometric configuration of the expansion portion <b>803</b>. Furthermore, an interior corner <b>816</b> is defined by an interior angle between an interior ledge or step <b>818</b> and the interior wall <b>812</b>. As illustrated, the ledge <b>818</b> extends substantially perpendicularly outward from the horizontal pneumatic conduit <b>620</b>, i.e., away from the horizontal liquid conduit <b>622</b>. The interior wall <b>812</b> extends between the point <b>808</b> and the ledge <b>818</b>, forming the interior corner <b>816</b>. As appreciated, an angle <b>820</b> of the corner <b>816</b> may be varied by adjusting a length of the ledge <b>818</b> and/or the wall <b>812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In certain configurations, an alternative embodiment of the fifth layer may be included. The alternative fifth layer may be substantially similar to layer <b>802</b>. Layers <b>802</b>, <b>810</b> and the alternative fifth layer may be sandwiched between layers <b>604</b> and <b>612</b> of the spray device <b>108</b> presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Thus, the thickness of the expansion portion <b>803</b> may be defined by the combined thicknesses of the layers <b>802</b>, <b>810</b> and the fifth layer. In this configuration, the alternative embodiment may function in a similar manner to the previously described embodiment, while limiting buildup of salt and/or other minerals in the flow path of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a detailed top view of liquid orifice <b>302</b> and pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> of the alternative embodiment of the fourth layer <b>810</b>, showing the flow path of gas (e.g., air) around the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. As previously described, expansion portion <b>803</b> is configured to reduce the buildup of salt and/or other minerals that may interfere with the flow of gas from pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. As illustrated, gas emitted from pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may flow in a downstream direction <b>821</b>. As appreciated, the flowing gas may establish a region of low pressure, drawing surrounding air toward the flow. Specifically, gas from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> and/or surrounding air may recirculate in a direction <b>822</b>. Water droplets may be captured by the air flow and directed toward the point <b>808</b>. A portion of the water droplets may adhere to the point <b>808</b>, while other droplets remain in the air flow. Over time, the droplets that adhere to the point <b>808</b> may evaporate, causing an accumulation of salt and/or other minerals on the point <b>808</b>, as represented by buildup <b>824</b>. However, due to the small surface area associated with the point <b>808</b>, recirculating air flow along direction <b>822</b> and/or gas flow from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may dislodge the buildup <b>824</b> from the point <b>808</b>. Specifically, the flows may apply a shear force along the point <b>808</b> in a direction away from the spray device <b>108</b>. As previously discussed, the small surface area of the point <b>808</b> increases the likelihood that a given flow pressure may dislodge the buildup <b>824</b>. Therefore, the flows may remove the buildup <b>824</b> from the point <b>808</b> and carry it in a downstream direction <b>821</b>. In addition, the spray device <b>108</b> may vibrate during operation, providing an additional force to extricate the buildup <b>824</b>. Therefore, the quantity of salt and/or other minerals deposited adjacent to the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may be minimized. Furthermore, the buildup <b>824</b> on the point <b>808</b> may be substantially outside of the flow path of gas emitted from the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>. Consequently, flow conditions may be generally uniform over extended use of the spray device <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In addition, buildup <b>824</b> on the point <b>808</b> may be further reduced because a portion of the water droplets captured by the recirculating air may remain in the air flow. As illustrated, water droplets captured by air flowing in direction <b>822</b> may bypass the point <b>808</b> and flow in a direction <b>826</b>. For example, more than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% of the water droplets may remain in the flow. Because some of the water droplets do not adhere to the point <b>808</b>, less buildup <b>824</b> may be formed. In certain embodiments, the direction <b>826</b> may be substantially similar to the downstream direction <b>821</b> of the gas flow from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. In this configuration, the recirculating air flow may combine with the gas from the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. In addition, a portion of the air and/or gas flow may return to the exit surface <b>805</b>, thus establishing the recirculating flow in direction <b>822</b>. Further embodiments may include a curved recess in the exit surface <b>805</b> adjacent to the expansion portion <b>803</b> and configured to direct the air flow toward the point <b>808</b>. The combination of directing water droplets away from the spray device <b>108</b> and the small surface area of the point <b>808</b> may reduce salt and/or mineral buildup that may interfere with gas flow from pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>, thereby maintaining a substantially uniform spray pattern <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">It is believed that a second recirculation zone may be formed within the expansion portion <b>803</b>. Specifically, a portion of the gas flowing through the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b> may flow in a direction <b>828</b> prior to exiting the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Water droplets may be captured within the recirculating flow and deposited in the interior corner <b>816</b> of the expansion portion <b>803</b>. As the water evaporates, a buildup <b>830</b> may be formed within the corner <b>816</b>. As illustrated, the buildup <b>830</b> may be substantially outside of the flow path of gas emitted from the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>. In this manner, the buildup <b>830</b> may not interfere with the gas flow from pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. Over time, the buildup <b>830</b> may expand as additional salt and/or other minerals are deposited in the corner <b>816</b>. However, once the buildup <b>830</b> reaches a critical size, it may become dislodged by the gas flow from the horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>. Therefore, the size of buildup <b>830</b> may be limited to prevent interference with the gas flow. The combination of features described above may reduce salt and/or mineral deposits within and/or surrounding pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>, thereby maintaining a substantially uniform spray pattern <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a top view of a third alternative embodiment of a fourth layer <b>902</b> of the spray device <b>108</b>. Layer <b>902</b> may replace layer <b>608</b> of the embodiment described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>. As illustrated, layer <b>902</b> includes a curved portion <b>904</b> similar to the curved portion <b>705</b> described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>. The curved portion <b>904</b> is configured to direct a flow of gas toward a point <b>905</b> such that water droplets impact the point <b>905</b> and/or are redirected away from the spray device <b>108</b>. Any salt and/or mineral buildup on the point <b>905</b> may be dislodged by gas flow and/or vibration of the spray device <b>108</b>. In this manner, salt and/or mineral buildup within the flow path of the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b> may be reduced. In addition, layer <b>902</b> includes an expansion portion <b>906</b> within each horizontal pneumatic conduit <b>620</b>. The expansion portions <b>906</b> are configured to induce recirculation within the recesses and/or adjacent to an exit surface <b>908</b>. As previously discussed, recirculation within the expansion portion <b>906</b> may deposit salt and/or other minerals outside of the flow path of gas emitted from horizontal pneumatic conduits <b>620</b>. In contrast to the rectangular expansion portions <b>803</b> described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref>, the expansion portions <b>906</b> of layer <b>902</b> form a curved shape. This configuration may provide enhanced reduction of deposits adjacent to the pneumatic orifices <b>408</b>. In addition, the combination of the curved portions <b>904</b> and the expansion portions <b>906</b> may serve to reduce mineral deposits to a greater extent than either feature alone. Therefore, the present embodiment may enable the spray device <b>108</b> to maintain a substantially uniform spray pattern <b>304</b>.</p>
