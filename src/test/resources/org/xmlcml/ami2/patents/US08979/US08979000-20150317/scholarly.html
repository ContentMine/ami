      <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
      <?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
      
      <div>
         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for atomizing a liquid into
            fine mists. The invention relates in particular to an ultrasonic atomization method
            and apparatus that is used as an apparatus for atomizing Sake, alcohol used for Sake
            production, petroleum, crude oil or the like into the mists to obtain a highly concentrated
            solution as a target substance, or which is optimally used as a humidifier, etc. for
            atomizing water into the mists to be vaporized into the air.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Art</p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present inventor has previously developed an apparatus for atomizing a liquid
            containing alcohol into mists, collecting such atomized mists, and separating highly
            concentrated alcohol (see Patent Document 1). This separation apparatus can, for example,
            ultrasonically oscillate a starting liquid containing alcohol, atomize the liquid
            into fine mists to be sent into carrier gas, separate and collect the atomized mists,
            and separate an alcohol liquid having a higher concentration than the starting liquid.
            The separation apparatus of this system can separate a highly concentrated alcohol
            with a small amount of energy when compared with an apparatus in which a starting
            liquid is heated and vaporized.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, a humidifier ultrasonically oscillating and atomizing water into the
            mists and vaporizing the atomized mists can humidify the air with a large amount of
            water and with a small amount of power consumption when compared with a method of
            heating and vaporizing the water.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the case of the apparatus for atomizing a liquid into the mists, it is vital how
            efficiently the liquid can be ultrasonically oscillated and atomized into the mists.
            This is because the efficiency of atomizing into the mists determines the amount of
            energy to be consumed, and when the efficiency decreases, the energy consumption increases
            accordingly. For example, when a lowly concentrated alcohol having been obtained from
            fermented organic substances is to be separated from water in producing a highly concentrated
            alcohol, the atomization of water into the mists can be utilized. This is because
            the lowly concentrated alcohol is atomized into the mists and the atomized mists are
            collected to obtain a highly concentrated alcohol. The lowly concentrated alcohol
            is produced by fermentation of organic waste. According to this method, a huge amount
            of waste can be efficiently utilized to produce a lowly concentrated alcohol. Conventionally,
            however, the lowly concentrated alcohol is distilled for concentration into the highly
            concentrated alcohol, which leads to a great amount of energy consumption. Thus, for
            production of a highly concentrated alcohol, a large amount of energy is consumed
            in order to utilize the lowly concentrated alcohol being available at a lower cost,
            which results in an increased cost due to a large amount of energy consumption. It
            is really important to seek a lower cost process for converting the lowly concentrated
            alcohol to the highly concentrated alcohol. The method of atomizing the lowly concentrated
            alcohol into the mists can save energy consumption because the alcohol is not vaporized
            unlike in the method of distillation. In the process of atomization into the mists,
            however, it is important to efficiently atomize the lowly concentrated alcohol into
            the mists.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">The apparatus is also used as a humidifier for ultrasonically oscillating water into
            the mists. For this humidifier as well, it is important to increase the efficiency
            of atomizing into the mists by the ultrasonic oscillation in order to achieve efficient

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">The apparatus shown in figref[FIG. 2]
            	 is designed to ultrasonically oscillate and atomize a liquid into mists. In this
            apparatus, a liquid column P generated in projecting upwardly of the liquid surface
            W by means of the ultrasonic oscillation is blasted by a laterally blown wind, by
            which wind the liquid column P is bent down in a parallel direction with respect to
            the liquid surface W and thus the atomization efficiency is improved. By bending down
            the liquid column in a parallel direction with respect to the liquid surface, the
            apparatus can efficiently atomize the liquid inside the liquid column because attenuation
            of the vertical ultrasonic oscillation caused by collision is effectively prevented.
            However, if an even higher atomization efficiency is available than this particular
            atomization apparatus, it will be possible to further reduce running and equipment
            costs to minimum. In particular, the apparatus shown in figref[FIG. 2]
            	 suffers a disadvantage that it is difficult to increase an atomization efficiency
            by using multiple ultrasonic oscillators in order to increase an amount of atomization
            per unit time.

            seventh aspects of the invention can yield such an excellent efficiency of atomization
            as may exceed a conventional method and apparatus of atomization. For example, in
            terms of the same ultrasonic oscillator and the same air volume, a speed of atomization
            per hour in the ultrasonic atomization apparatus as shown in figref[FIG. 3]
            	 exhibits a superb improvement of being more than seven times the speed achieved by
            the apparatus shown in figref[FIG. 2]
            	. This is because in the atomization method and apparatus of the present invention
            the carrier gas is sucked from the lateral point being away at a distance (d
            <b>1</b>)) of 5 cm or less from the center axis of the liquid column and is blown to the liquid
            column, and thus the carrier gas flows across the liquid column to efficiently separate
            from the liquid column the mists which are atomized around the periphery of the liquid
            column.

         <p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the ultrasonic atomization method according to a second aspect of the invention,
            the carrier gas is blown across the intermediate point of the liquid column, and the
            mists can be efficiently separated from the liquid column. This is because the carrier
            gas blown across the liquid column can separate the mists from the liquid column at
            its full height.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the ultrasonic atomization method according to a third aspect of the invention,
            the carrier gas is blown from a first lateral point of the liquid column and sucked
            into a second lateral point of the liquid column, which assures that the carrier gas
            can be most efficiently used for separating the mists. This enables the mists to be
            efficiently separated with a particularly smaller air volume.

         <p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the ultrasonic atomization method according to a fifth aspect of the invention,
            a plurality of ultrasonic oscillators efficiently separate the mists from each of

            plurality of ultrasonic oscillators enables a total amount of atomizable mists to
            be highly increased.

         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the ultrasonic atomization apparatus according to an eighth aspect of the invention,
            the carrier gas is blown out of the blower port in the blast mechanism to the lateral

            liquid column into the suction port in the suction mechanism in a manner that the
            carrier gas is carried across the liquid column. The carrier gas blown from a first
            lateral point of the liquid column and sucked into a second lateral point can be most
            efficiently used for separation of the mists. Thus, the mists can be efficiently separated
            with a smaller air volume in the blower mechanism.

         <p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the ultrasonic atomization apparatus according to a tenth aspect of the invention,
            the arrangement of the suction port and blower port respectively at the opposing lateral
            points away from the liquid column enables the carrier gas fed out of the blower port
            to be carried across the liquid column for an efficient suction into the suction port.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the ultrasonic atomization apparatus according to an eleventh aspect of the invention,
            the arrangement of the liquid column between the suction port and the blower port,

            blown rectilinearly from the blower port to the suction port, with the dispersion
            of the carrier gas being reduced to minimum. In addition, the passage of such blown
            carrier gas through the liquid column enables the mists to be separated in a specially

         <p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present ultrasonic atomization method and apparatus, the liquid is ultrasonically
            oscillated to atomize the mists into the carrier gas. A specific example in which
            the ultrasonic atomization apparatus is used as a separation apparatus shall now be
            discussed in conjunction with embodiment(s) of the present invention. In the separation
            apparatus described below, a liquid containing two or more substances is ultrasonically
            oscillated to be atomized into mists, and such atomized mists are condensed and collected
            to thus separate the liquid. In the present invention, however, an application of
            the ultrasonic atomization apparatus is not limited to a liquid separation apparatus.
            The ultrasonic atomization apparatus of the present invention can also be used as
            a humidifier for atomizing water into mists to be vaporized into the air.

         <p id="p-0073" num="0072">When a liquid containing two or more substances is ultrasonically oscillated to separate
            mists from the liquid and such separated mists are condensed and collected, a concentration
            of contained substance(s) differs between the liquid collected from the mists and
            the remaining liquid which is not turned to the mists. For example, when an alcoholic
            solution is atomized into mists by the ultrasonic oscillation and such atomized mists
            are collected, the liquid thus collected from the atomized mists has a higher concentration
            of alcohol than does the remaining alcohol which is not turned to the mists. The reason
            for such higher alcohol concentration in the liquid obtained by condensing and collecting
            the mists is that when compared with the water, the alcohol is easier to be atomized
            into fine mists by the ultrasonic oscillation.

            can be used for separating any of the liquids that can be separated in the form of

            sucked into the suction port

            around the liquid column P are more likely to be sucked into the suction port 
            <b>22</b>, resulting in a difficulty of selectively sucking fine mists alone. When larger mists
            are sucked, a separation efficiency decreases in the case of the separation apparatus.
            For example, in the case of an apparatus for atomizing an alcoholic solution into
            the mists, an alcoholic concentration with fine mists becomes higher than the one

            an advantage that the ultrasonic oscillation can be efficiently transmitted inwardly

            the energy required of the ultrasonic oscillator for atomization can be made smaller,
            but the surface area of the liquid column becomes smaller and the efficiency of atomizing

            <b>5</b>. The mists, not being the gas in nature, can be condensed and collected without being

         <p id="p-0107" num="0106">And, although not illustrated, the collection unit can also be so designed that a
            vapor of target substance such as alcohol contained in the gas is adsorbed into an

            into the adsorbent can be removed by using a heated recovery gas, and then the recovery
            gas is cooled to condense and recover the removed alcohol. Such a collection unit
            can be composed of a rotor with the adsorbent provided in an air gap, and a rotational
            drive mechanism for rotating the rotor. The rotor is a honeycomb rotor having the
            air gap through which a carrier gas can pass in the direction of the rotational axis.
            As the adsorbent, for example, any one of zeolite, activated carbon, lithium oxide
            and silica gel or a mixture of them can be used. In this collection unit, the rotor
            is rotated at a predetermined speed by means of the rotational drive mechanism and
            moved between an adsorbing region in which the vapor is adsorbed and a releasing region
            in which the adsorbed vapor is released. When the rotor is moved into the adsorbing
            region, the gas containing the vapor of alcohol that is the target substance is passed
            through the air gap, and the alcohol contained as a target substance in the gas is
            adsorbed by the adsorbent. When the rotor is rotated and moved into the releasing
            region, the adsorbed alcohol as a target substance is released. The released alcohol
            as a target substance is recovered by cooling the recovery gas. The gas having passed
            through the adsorbing region of the rotor is moved back to the ultrasonic atomization
            chamber again.

            with a plurality of baffles inside, upon the surface of baffle the mists are impinged

            has an uneven or rugged surface to enable the mists to be in contact with the surface
            and collected more efficiently. Furthermore, the collection unit is provided with
            a fan for forcibly blowing and agitating the mists. Thus, the mists in the collection
