      <h1>abstract"</h1>
      
      <p>The present disclosure generally relates to fluid sprayers and more specifically,
         but not by limitation, to a portable airless fluid sprayer including fluid container
         support features configured to accommodate fluid containers of different sizes. In
         one example, a fluid sprayer pump assembly is provided and includes a pump assembly
         housing and a fluid intake conduit configured to provide a fluid path to the pump
         assembly housing. The fluid sprayer pump assembly also includes a frame assembly supporting
         the pump assembly housing and including a plurality of fluid container support features.
         Each of the fluid container support features is configured to accommodate a respective
         fluid container such that an inlet end of the fluid intake conduit is positionable
         within the respective fluid container. In one example, a fluid container support feature
         includes a fluid container holder pivotably attached to the frame assembly and movable
         between first and second positions.

         <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
         <p id="p-0002" num="0001">An exemplary fluid sprayer includes a portable airless paint sprayer having a pumping
            unit for pumping paint supplied from a paint source, such as a paint container. In
            one instance, the pumping unit is driven by an electric motor to supply a flow of
            pressurized paint to an output nozzle or tip of a spray gun. The output nozzle or
            tip has a particular shape and size to generate a desired spray pattern. Other types
            of fluid sprayers include air-driven or air-assisted devices. For example, some types
            of paint sprayers employ compressed gas, usually air compressed by an air compressor
            or turbine, to atomize and direct paint particles onto a surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many painting applications require user mobility and necessitate portability of a
            paint source, such as a paint container. Some application examples include, but are
            not limited to, painting an exterior of a building, painting interior walls and ceilings
            of a building, painting or staining a deck or fence, to name a few.

         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">figref[FIG. 1]
            	 is a perspective view of a fluid sprayer 
            <b>100</b> comprising a portable fluid pump assembly 
            <b>101</b>. Fluid sprayer 
            <b>100</b> is configured to spray fluid material supplied from a fluid container (not shown
            in figref[FIG. 1]
            	) through the air onto a surface. As used herein, “fluid” or “fluid material” refers
            to liquids for spray-coating applications such as, but not limited to, paints, varnishes,
            stains, inks, and the like. In the embodiment illustrated in figref[FIG. 1]
            	, sprayer 
            <b>100</b> comprises an airless sprayer configured to spray atomized paint. However, sprayer
            
            <b>100</b> can include other configurations and can be utilized to spray other types of fluid
            materials.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">A housing 
            <b>102</b> of pump assembly 
            <b>101</b> houses an electric drive or motor operably configured to drive a fluid pump mechanism.
            In one embodiment, the fluid pump mechanism comprises a reciprocating piston pump
            that delivers pressurized paint to an output port 
            <b>106</b>. A conduit, such as a sprayer hose 
            <b>107</b>, can be connected to housing 
            <b>102</b> at output port 
            <b>106</b> and supply the pressurized paint to a spray gun 
            <b>109</b>, for example. Pump assembly 
            <b>101</b> includes a power switch 
            <b>108</b> (illustratively an on/off switch) and a pressure adjustment mechanism 
            <b>110</b> (illustratively a rotatable dial). A power cord (not shown in figref[FIG. 1]
            	) is configured to provide electrical power from a wall outlet, for example.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">Pump assembly 
            <b>101</b> includes a fluid intake conduit 
            <b>114</b> and a fluid return conduit 
            <b>116</b> (collectively referred to as conduit set 
            <b>115</b>). Fluid intake conduit 
            <b>114</b> illustratively comprises a suction or siphon tube having an inlet end 
            <b>112</b> positionable within the fluid container. Conduit 
            <b>114</b> is configured to supply an inlet paint flow from the inlet end 
            <b>112</b> to the fluid pump mechanism in housing 
            <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, a fluid filter 
            <b>113</b> is mounted at the inlet end 
            <b>112</b> of conduit 
            <b>114</b>. Preferably, inlet end 
            <b>112</b> is positioned at (i.e., in contact with or spaced a small distance away from) the
            bottom of the fluid container. In this arrangement, conduit 
            <b>114</b> can remove substantially all the contents of the fluid container while minimizing
            the possibility of air entering inlet end 
            <b>112</b> during operation of sprayer 
            <b>100</b>. Fluid return conduit 
            <b>116</b> illustratively comprises a return tube providing a return path from housing 
            <b>102</b> for paint and/or air, for example during priming of the fluid pump mechanism.

            <b>102</b> at an elevated position above a support surface 
            <b>122</b> (such as a floor of a worksite) on which base 
            <b>120</b> is positioned. Intake conduit 
            <b>114</b> depends from a bottom of housing 
            <b>102</b> and into an interior of the paint container. In the illustrated embodiment, frame
            base 
            <b>120</b> includes a pair of wheels 
            <b>124</b> connected by an axle 
            <b>126</b>. Axle 
            <b>126</b> is mounted at ends of a pair of downwardly extending legs 
            <b>128</b>, which are attached to housing support assembly 
            <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, legs 
            <b>128</b> are formed as separate components, each being mounted to platform 
            <b>118</b> individually. In the illustrated embodiment, legs 
            <b>128</b> are integral, formed of a single unitary body. In this manner, legs 
            <b>128</b> form a support structure that is substantially U-shaped. Assembly 
            <b>118</b> is secured to legs 
            <b>128</b> such that the platform formed by assembly 
            <b>118</b> is substantially parallel to support surface

            <b>132</b> of each leg 
            <b>130</b> is configured to engage surface 
            <b>122</b>. A second end 
            <b>133</b> of each leg 
            <b>130</b> is configured to accommodate a handle 
            <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, the second end 
            <b>133</b> of each leg 
            <b>130</b> comprises a handle adjustment mechanism 
            <b>135</b> that slidably receives a portion of handle

            <b>130</b> are positioned on support surface 
            <b>122</b>. In other embodiments, the length of fluid intake conduit 
            <b>114</b> can be longer or shorter (i.e., smaller or larger gaps between inlet end 
            <b>112</b> and surface

         <p id="p-0021" num="0020">Pump assembly 
            <b>101</b> includes one or more fluid container support features configured to accommodate a
            fluid container under support assembly 
            <b>118</b>. For example, the fluid container support features include one or more fluid container
            holders each configured to suspend a fluid container from assembly 
            <b>118</b>. For instance, an exemplary fluid container holder is configured to suspend a fluid
            container above surface 
            <b>122</b> when a user tilts assembly 
            <b>101</b> backward on wheels 
            <b>124</b> (i.e., in direction 
            <b>142</b>), for example to move assembly 
            <b>101</b> about a worksite. This enables the user to easily transport assembly 
            <b>101</b> without requiring the user to remove and separately carry the fluid container. Further,
            the one or more fluid container holders are configured such that the inlet end 
            <b>112</b> of intake conduit 
            <b>114</b> is positioned within the interior of the paint container proximate (i.e., near and/or
            in contact with) an interior bottom surface of the paint container. In one example,
            a height of a fluid container holder from surface 
            <b>122</b> is such that a fluid container is suspended therefrom with a small gap between the
            fluid container and surface 
            <b>122</b>, when legs 
            <b>130</b> are also supported on surface 
            <b>122</b> (i.e., the user is not tilting assembly 
            <b>101</b>). In another example, a height of a fluid container holder from surface 
            <b>122</b> is such that the fluid container rests on surface 
            <b>122</b>, when legs 
            <b>130</b> are also supported on surface 
            <b>122</b> (i.e., the user is not tilting assembly 
            <b>101</b>).

         <p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with one embodiment, assembly 
            <b>101</b> includes a plurality of fluid container support features configured to accommodate
            fluid containers of different sizes. This is advantageous as it enables greater user
            flexibility in selecting and using paint sources (e.g., a user can use either one
            gallon or five gallon paint containers, for example). Because different sized containers
            can be utilized, the user is not required to transfer paint from one container to
            another, for example if paint is only available in one type of container. In contrast,
            when using conventional sprayers that only accommodate a single paint container size,
            a user must transfer (i.e., pour) paint from one container to another if the user
            does not have a full paint container of the correct size. This is time consuming and
            can result in spillage, which can result in waste and require cleanup.

            <b>140</b> is configured to receive a fluid container having the same (or similar) dimensions
            to a conventional five-gallon pail such that intake conduit 
            <b>114</b> is properly positioned in the fluid container. One example of a fluid container is
