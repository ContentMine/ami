      <p>A filtration irrigation method, filtration irrigation device and the manufacturing
         method thereof, said filtration irrigation device comprises a water carrying chamber,
         in which one or more porous filter membranes are arranged. One or more flow restrictors
         corresponding to each membrane are set on the wall of the water carrying chamber.
         The total permeation capacity of the flow restrictors is less than that of said filter
         membranes. The present invention can avoid the blockage of the device effectively.

         <h1>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a micro-irrigation technique for irrigating plants,
            and particularly, to an infiltration irrigation method, an infiltration irrigation
            apparatus and a method for manufacturing the same.

         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the drip irrigation and the infiltration irrigation at present, a most important
            problem is the blockage of the water outflow pores of the irrigator. In order to prevent
            the blockage, a common method is to perform a water treatment at the water supply
            end of the irrigation pipeline. However, this requires a very large investment on

         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">A diameter of the drip irrigation water outflow pore is generally between 0.5 and
            1 mm, and the diameter of the infiltration irrigation water outflow pore is mainly
            from tens of microns to more than one hundred microns. It is found upon research that
            the blockage is caused by many impurities of different diameters within the above
            pore diameter ranges, and the particle diameter ranges from tens of microns to less
            than one micron. Careful studies show that the blockage process of these water outflow
            pores is as follows. The water in the pipe flows in an axial direction under pressure,
            wherein some water flows out in a radial direction through the water outflow pores,
            i.e., becomes irrigation water. Particles carried in the water with small diameters
            or diameters close to those of the water outflow pores form a bridge and block the
            outflow passage due to quick impact and drive by the water flowing by the water outflow
            pores. Thus smaller pores are remained near the bridge, while these pores will be
            further occupied by other particles or smaller particle bridges, and then are gradually
            blocked.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">For this reason, it is necessary to provide an infiltration irrigation apparatus to
            solve or improve the problem of the blockage of the water outflow pores in the current
            drip irrigation and infiltration irrigation.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide an infiltration irrigation method,
            an infiltration irrigation apparatus and a method for manufacturing the same, which
            are capable of automatically clearing the obstructions by sufficiently utilizing the
            water flow to improve or prevent the blockage of the infiltration irrigation apparatus,
            prolong the service life of the infiltration irrigation apparatus, and reduce the
            use cost.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">After repeated tests and studies of the water in the pipe, the inventor finds that
            when the diameter of the infiltration irrigation water outflow pore is small enough
            and the water outflow rate is sufficiently low, the impurities are difficult to block
            the outflow passage. Instead, they are slightly attached to the surfaces of the outflow
            pores, and then can be easily cleared by a shearing force generated by parallel water
            stream in the pipe. An anti-blockage and water-saving infiltration irrigation apparatus
            then can be manufactured by sufficiently utilizing such characteristic. The whole
            irrigation system adopting the infiltration irrigation apparatus can completely perform
            an automatic cleaning just using the water stream inside the irrigation pipeline,
            without needing any water treatment device, and will not be blocked during a long-term
            usage.

         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet another optional embodiment of the present invention, the porous filter membrane

         <p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the infiltration irrigation apparatus and the infiltration irrigation method
            of the present invention are adopted, since the total water seepage capability of
            the one or more flow restrictors is smaller than that of the one or more porous filter
            membranes, the total water outflow of the one or more flow restrictors is smaller
            than that of the one or more porous filter membranes, which reduces the amount of
            water penetrating the one or more porous filter membrane. Therefore, the water penetration
            rate of the porous filter membrane is reduced, and the impact speed of the impurities
            carried in the water on the porous filter membrane is decreased, so that the impurities
            are attached to the surface of the porous filter membrane very slightly. In addition,
            as the porous filter membrane is disposed in the water passing chamber, the surface
            of the porous filter membrane can be washed through the axial water stream in the
            water passing chamber, so that the impurities attached to the surface of the porous
            filter membrane very slightly are washed away by the water stream flowing along the
            surface of the porous filter membrane, which improves or avoids the blockage of the
            porous filter membrane, and effectively improves the blockage of the infiltration
            irrigation apparatus. Further, since the maximum pore diameter of the restricting
            orifice of the flow restrictor is preferably larger than that of the porous filter
            membrane, the restricting orifice will not be blocked when the water filtered by the
            porous filter membrane flows by the restricting orifice. Therefore, the infiltration
            irrigation apparatus of the present invention is very difficult to be blocked during
            the usage, and the service life of an infiltration irrigation system using such infiltration
            irrigation apparatus is far prolonged as compared with the case of adopting the infiltration
            irrigation apparatus of the prior art, which greatly reduces the use cost.

            engaged (by hot melting or gluing) with each other to form the plastic sheet into

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</h1>
         <p id="p-0068" num="0067">Other features, advantages and embodiments of the present invention will be illustrated
            or explained in the following descriptions, drawings and claims. In addition, it shall
            be appreciated that the above summary and the following descriptions are just exemplary,
            and they intend to provide further explanations, instead of limiting the scope of
            the present invention.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0069" num="0068">Through a large number of tests, the inventor finds that whether the water stream
            in a pipe can burst through impurity particles blocked in the water outflow passage
            depends on the adhesive force of the impurities on the water outflow passage. Meanwhile,
            the adhesive force of the impurities on the water outflow passage is directly influenced
            by the particle size and the “impact speed” of the impurities blocked on the water
            outflow pore when the impurities is carried by a radial water stream to the water
            outflow pore. That is, the faster the “impact speed” is, the deeper the location of
            the impurities blocked in the water outflow passage is, the larger the adhesive force
            is, and the impurities are not easy to be burst through by an axial parallel water
            stream. On the contrary, if the location of the impurities blocked in the water outflow
            passage is shallow, the adhesive force is small, and the impurities are easy to be
            burst through by a transverse water stream. Since the particle sizes of the impurities
            determine the “impact speed” of the impurities during the settlement in the water,
            the relation between the particle size and the settling speed is described as follow
            by taking the sediment particles as an example: the coarse sand with a particle diameter
            of 1 mm sinks at 1 m/s in the water, the fine sand with a particle diameter of 0.1
            mm sinks at 8 mm/s, the fine soil with a particle diameter of 10 microns sinks at
            0.154 mm/s, and the fine clay with a particle diameter of 1 micron sinks at 0.00154
            mm/s The specific gravity of the clay particle is the same as that of the coarse sediment,
            and the great difference in settling speed is caused by the Brownian motion. The smaller
            the particle diameter of the impurities in the water is, the stronger the Brownian
            motion is. Thus, under the influence of the Brownian motion, the smaller impurities
            have a lower adhesive force on the water outflow pore. Such impurities will be displaced
            for a large distance even by a very slight water oscillation, and can be easily cleared
            by the water stream in the pipe.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0070" num="0069">On the other hand, even the porous filter membrane is not easy to be blocked due to
            the tiny particles of impurities are influenced by the Brownian motion, the blockage
            possibility may be greatly increased when the water penetrating the pores has a high
            water outflow rate, because the flow rate of the tiny particles carried in the water
            stream will also be increased.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0071" num="0070">Based on the above influence factors, the present invention provides an infiltration
            irrigation apparatus. As illustrated in figref[FIGS. 1 to 25]
            	, the infiltration irrigation apparatus of the present invention includes a water
            passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>, one or more porous filter membranes 
            <b>2</b>, and one or more flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b>. In which, the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> has a water inlet 
            <b>11</b> and a water outlet 
            <b>12</b>, and when the water flows between the water inlet 
            <b>11</b> and the water outlet 
            <b>12</b>, a water stream along an axial direction of the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> will be formed in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>. The one or more porous filter membranes 
            <b>2</b> are disposed in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> and formed with a filtration section 
            <b>20</b> for accommodating the water filtered by the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. The location of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is set so that when an axial water stream exists in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>, at least a part of the water stream flows along a surface of the porous filter membrane
            
            <b>2</b> to wash the surface. Each of the flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> is disposed on a sidewall of the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> corresponding to the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. Each of the flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> has one or more restricting orifices, an inlet communicated with the filtration section
            
            <b>20</b> of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> and an outlet outside the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>, and a total water seepage capability of the one or more flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> is smaller than that of the one or more porous filter membranes 
            <b>2</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present invention further provides an infiltration irrigation method based on
            the above infiltration irrigation apparatus. In which, one or more porous filter membranes
            
            <b>2</b> are installed in a water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> and formed with a filtration section 
            <b>20</b> for accommodating the water filtered by the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. One or more flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> are disposed on a sidewall of the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> corresponding to the location of each of the porous filter membranes 
            <b>2</b>. Each of the flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> has one or more restricting orifices, an inlet communicated with the filtration section
            
            <b>20</b> of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> and an outlet outside the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>, and a total water seepage capability of the one or more flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> is smaller than that of the one or more porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. The water in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> is made to flow axially at regular time so that the axial water stream flows along
            a surface of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> to wash the surface.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, when an infiltration irrigation is carried out, the water is firstly filtered
            by the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> and enters the filtration section 
            <b>20</b>, then the water filtered by the filtration section 
            <b>20</b> flows out through the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b>. Since the total water seepage capability of the one or more flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> is designed to be smaller than that of the one or more porous filter membranes 
            <b>2</b> in the present invention, the total water outflow amount of the one or more flow
            restrictors 
            <b>3</b> is smaller than that of the one or more porous filter membranes 
            <b>2</b>, which reduces the amount of water penetrating the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. Therefore, the water penetration rate of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is reduced, and the impact speed of the impurities carried in the water stream on
            the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is decreased, so that the impurities are attached to the surface of the porous filter
            membrane 
            <b>2</b> very slightly. In addition, as the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is disposed in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>, the surface of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> can be washed through the axial water stream in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>, so that the impurities attached to the surface of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> very slightly are washed away by the water stream flowing along the surface of the
            porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, which improves or avoids a blockage of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, and effectively improves the blockage problem of the entire infiltration irrigation
            apparatus.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the present invention, a maximum pore diameter of the restricting orifice of the
            flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is preferably set to be larger than a maximum pore diameter of the porous filter
            membrane 
            <b>2</b> (it can refer to Chinese national standard GB/T 1967-1996 for the method of measuring
            the maximum pore diameter). Thus a control may be carried out in the aspects of water
            penetration diameter and water seepage rate. Since the maximum pore diameter of the
            restricting orifice of the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is larger than that of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, the water filtered by the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> will not cause a blockage when flowing through the restricting orifice.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the present invention, the maximum pore diameter may be defined as follows: a pore
            diameter corresponding to an intensity of pressure required for enabling the gas to
            pass through one end and a first bubble to occur at the other end after a porous substance
            is wetted by a liquid. The definitions of various pore diameters in the present invention
            may be acquired with reference to prior methods for measuring the pore diameter of
            the porous substance, and herein are not described in details.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0076" num="0075">As illustrated in figref[FIG. 3]
            	, a plurality of flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> may be disposed at the water outflow side corresponding to each of the porous filter
            membranes 
            <b>2</b>, and each of the flow restrictors 
            <b>3</b> has at least one restricting orifice. The total water outflow amount of these flow
            restrictors 
            <b>3</b> is smaller than that of the porous filter membrane(s) 
            <b>2</b>, i.e., the total water seepage of each flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is smaller than that of corresponding porous filter membrane(s) 
            <b>2</b>, and the water filtered by all the porous filter membrane(s) 
            <b>2</b> will not flow out of the infiltration irrigation apparatus unless passing through
            these restricting orifices.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0077" num="0076">As mentioned above, the maximum pore diameter of the restricting orifice in the flow
            restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is larger than that of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, so that the water filtered by the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> will not cause a blockage when passing through the restricting orifice. These restricting
            orifices function to reduce the amount of water penetrating the porous filter membrane
            
            <b>2</b> in a certain proportion upon demand, so as to decrease the water penetration rate
            of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. That is, the impact speed of the impurities carried in the water stream on the porous
            filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is decreased, so that the impurities are attached very slightly to the pores of the
            porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> and can be easily washed away by the water stream. Such infiltration irrigation apparatus
            is suitable to a wide range of water supplying pressure, and the water outflow of
            the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> under a certain water supplying pressure may be controlled by selecting an appropriate
            number and appropriate pore diameters of restricting orifices. Thus the water has
            a sufficiently low penetration rate on the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> of a certain area where it penetrates, so as to ensure that the surface of the porous
            filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> will not be blocked under the washing of the water stream of a low flow rate.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0078" num="0077">Preferably, the present invention uses a porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> with the maximum pore diameter no more than 20 μm (more preferably 10 μm) as the
            water outflow passage for infiltration irrigation, so as to choose impurity particles
            having strong Brown motion characteristics to fit the pores of the porous filter membrane
            
            <b>2</b>. As a result, impurity particles capable of blocking the pores of the porous filter
            membrane 
            <b>2</b> are not easily to be attached to the pores of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, and can be washed away by the water flowing along the surface of the porous filter
            membrane 
            <b>2</b>. The particle diameters of smaller impurities are far less than the pores of the
            porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, and can easily pass through these pores without causing a blockage. Since large
            impurities will not be blocked in the membrane pores, the adhesive force is greatly
            reduced, and the impurities are easy to be washed away. Among even larger impurity
            particles there are many pores, and those impurities will not block the pores of the
            porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> even stayed on the surface of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, the present invention, by determining the diameters of pores of the porous filter
            membrane 
            <b>2</b>, chooses out impurities having strong Brown motion characteristics as potential obstructions.
            In the meantime, the flow rate of water penetrating the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is restricted by the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> so as to decrease the “impact speed” of the obstruction. Under the influence of the
            Brown motion, the obstructions can only suspend on the surface of the porous filter
            membrane 
            <b>2</b>, and can be easily carried away by the water stream on the surface of the porous
            filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, and the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> will nearly not be blocked by any particle. At the same time, the pore diameter of
            the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is larger than that of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, thus the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> also will not be blocked. Therefore, the infiltration irrigation apparatus of the
            present invention is difficult to be blocked, and the service life of the entire irrigation
            system using the infiltration irrigation apparatus is greatly prolonged.

         <p id="p-0080" num="0079">The water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> in the infiltration irrigation apparatus of the present invention may be formed in
            a tubular shape. As illustrated in figref[FIGS. 1]
            	, 
            <b>4</b> and

            in figref[FIGS. 6 and 7]
            	. Thus, when water flows in the water pipe, some flows in the axial direction of the
            water pipe and passes by the surface of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> to wash the surface, while some is filtered by the porous filter membrane

            <b>1</b>. Such axial flow of the water stream in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> may effectively wash the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, so that the impurities stayed thereon will be displaced and cannot block the pores
            of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, thus a long-time and stable operation of the entire irrigation system is ensured.
            Or, when the water pipe is an annular (circular, elliptical, rectangular or the like)
            structure, a micro pump may also be mounted on the pipe, so as to make the water in
            the pipe move periodically, and continuously clear the impurities on the porous filter
            membrane 
            <b>2</b>. Thus the membrane is ensured to be unobstructed and the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> will not be blocked, and the entire irrigation system can operate stably in a long
            term.

         <p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the present invention, the restricting orifices of the flow restrictor 
            <b>2</b> may be formed in various manners. For example, a porous medium having a capillary
            function or capillary tube bundles may be disposed in the flow restrictor 
            <b>2</b> to form a plurality of restricting orifices. Of course, the restricting orifices
            may also be formed in other manners known by persons skilled in the art, and herein
            is not limited.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0083" num="0082">During the actual operation, a manner may also be adopted in which the average or
            minimum pore diameter of the restricting orifice is larger than the maximum pore diameter
            of the porous filter membrane, which is more favorable to prevent the flow restrictor
            from being blocked (it can refer to Chinese national standard GB/T 1967-1996 for the
            method of measuring the average and minimum pore diameters).
         </p>
         <p id="p-0084" num="0083">Preferably, the maximum pore diameter of the restricting orifice 
            <b>3</b> is chosen to be equal to or greater than 5 times of that of the porous filter membrane
            
            <b>2</b>. Or even preferably, the maximum pore diameter of the restricting orifice 
            <b>3</b> is chosen to be equal to or greater than 10 times of that of the porous filter membrane
            
            <b>2</b>. The definitive relation between the pore diameters of the restricting orifice and
            the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> solves the problem that the restricting orifice is easy to be blocked.

         <p id="p-0085" num="0084">The larger the difference between the water seepage capabilities of the flow restrictor
            
            <b>3</b> and the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is, the slower the water seepage rate of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is, the smaller the “impact speed” of the impurity is, and the longer the service
            life of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. Thus, in order to manufacture an infiltration irrigation apparatus of an ultra-long
            service life, works of the following two aspects shall be done after the pore diameter
            of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> has been determined: on one hand, the water outflow of the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is decreased so far as possible on the condition that the water amount needed by
            the plants is satisfied, by reducing the number of the restricting orifices or the
            pore diameter thereof (not less than that of the porous filter membrane); on the other
            hand, water seepage capability of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is enhanced so far as possible by increasing the seepage area. Thus, an infiltration
            irrigation apparatus can be manufactured to work in long term using any water.

            <b>11</b> and a water outlet 
            <b>12</b>. The porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> covers a complete circumference of inner wall of the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>. The edges of both ends of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> may closely engage with the inner wall of the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> and then become waterproof, so as to form a filtration section 
            <b>20</b> between the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> and the inner wall of the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> covered thereby. The flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is disposed on a sidewall of the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> corresponding to the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. Each flow restrictor

         <p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus as illustrated in figref[FIGS. 1 to 8]
            	, since the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> covers the complete circumference of inner wall of the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b>, when an infiltration irrigation for plants is carried out, the water in the water
            passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> will be filtered by the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, enter the filtration section

            <b>3</b>, so as to form irrigation water for irrigating plants. Since the total water seepage
            capability of the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is smaller than that of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, i.e., the total water outflow amount of the flow restrictor 
            <b>3</b> is smaller than that of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>, the water penetrating the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> flows very slowly. After the infiltration irrigation apparatus is used for some time,
            the impurities in water will only be slightly attached to the porous filter membrane
            
            <b>2</b>. In that case, by making water in the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> flow axially, the axial water stream passing by the water passing chamber 
            <b>1</b> will flow along the surface of the porous filter membrane

            by appropriately extending the flow restrictor

            	, in this embodiment, the sidewall of the water passing chamber

            	 illustrate structural diagrams of Embodiment 3 of the present invention. The basic
            structure and the principle of this embodiment are substantially the same as that
            of Embodiment 1, and the descriptions of the same portions are omitted herein. As
            illustrated in figref[FIGS. 14 to 19]
            	, this embodiment differs from Embodiment 1 in that the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> is bag-shaped, and the filtration section 
            <b>20</b> is formed in a bag of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>. During the infiltration irrigation, the water cannot become irrigation water until
            it enters the bag through the bag-shaped porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> (i.e., into the filtration section

            <b>3</b>.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0118" num="0117">In addition to the effect of Embodiment 1, since a bag-shaped porous filter membrane
            
            <b>2</b> is used, a blockage is more difficult to be caused. Because firstly, as compared
            with the flush porous filter membrane, the bag-shaped porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b> can multiply the membrane area in a narrow space, reduce the adhesive force of impurities,
            and prolong the membrane life. Secondly, once water flows in the pipe, a pressure
            will be produced in a part of region of the bag of the porous filter membrane 
            <b>2</b>; such pressure is transferred to the water in the bag and causes a liquid pressure
            outward from the inside of the bag; and some water flows outwards from the inside
            of the bag through the pores on the membrane, so as to produce a certain effect of
            backwash and prolong the membrane life.
