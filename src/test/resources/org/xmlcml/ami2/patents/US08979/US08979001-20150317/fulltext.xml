<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">An exemplary fluid sprayer includes a portable airless paint sprayer having a pumping unit for pumping paint supplied from a paint source, such as a paint container. In one instance, the pumping unit is driven by an electric motor to supply a flow of pressurized paint to an output nozzle or tip of a spray gun. The output nozzle or tip has a particular shape and size to generate a desired spray pattern. Other types of fluid sprayers include air-driven or air-assisted devices. For example, some types of paint sprayers employ compressed gas, usually air compressed by an air compressor or turbine, to atomize and direct paint particles onto a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many painting applications require user mobility and necessitate portability of a paint source, such as a paint container. Some application examples include, but are not limited to, painting an exterior of a building, painting interior walls and ceilings of a building, painting or staining a deck or fence, to name a few.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one exemplary embodiment, a fluid sprayer pump assembly is provided and includes a pump assembly housing and a fluid intake conduit configured to provide a fluid path to the pump assembly housing. The fluid sprayer pump assembly also includes a frame assembly supporting the pump assembly housing and including a plurality of fluid container support features. Each of the fluid container support features is configured to accommodate a respective fluid container such that an inlet end of the fluid intake conduit is positionable within the respective fluid container. In one example, a fluid container support feature includes a fluid container holder pivotably attached to the frame assembly and movable between first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one exemplary embodiment, a frame for a fluid sprayer is provided. The frame includes a pump assembly frame, a base assembly configured to support the pump assembly frame at an elevated position above a support surface, and a fluid container support mechanism that is movable between a first position and second position in which the fluid container support mechanism is configured to receive and support a handle of a fluid container thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one exemplary embodiment, a fluid container support feature for a fluid sprayer is provided. The fluid container support feature includes a first portion configured to be pivotably attached to a frame of a fluid sprayer such that the fluid container support feature is movable with respect to the frame about a pivot axis between first and second positions. The fluid container support feature includes a second portion spaced from the first portion by a pair of arms extending between the first portion and second portion. The second portion includes a fluid container support surface configured to accommodate a fluid container.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These and various other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in the background.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a fluid sprayer <b>100</b> comprising a portable fluid pump assembly <b>101</b>. Fluid sprayer <b>100</b> is configured to spray fluid material supplied from a fluid container (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through the air onto a surface. As used herein, &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; or &#x201c;fluid material&#x201d; refers to liquids for spray-coating applications such as, but not limited to, paints, varnishes, stains, inks, and the like. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, sprayer <b>100</b> comprises an airless sprayer configured to spray atomized paint. However, sprayer <b>100</b> can include other configurations and can be utilized to spray other types of fluid materials.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A housing <b>102</b> of pump assembly <b>101</b> houses an electric drive or motor operably configured to drive a fluid pump mechanism. In one embodiment, the fluid pump mechanism comprises a reciprocating piston pump that delivers pressurized paint to an output port <b>106</b>. A conduit, such as a sprayer hose <b>107</b>, can be connected to housing <b>102</b> at output port <b>106</b> and supply the pressurized paint to a spray gun <b>109</b>, for example. Pump assembly <b>101</b> includes a power switch <b>108</b> (illustratively an on/off switch) and a pressure adjustment mechanism <b>110</b> (illustratively a rotatable dial). A power cord (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is configured to provide electrical power from a wall outlet, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Pump assembly <b>101</b> includes a fluid intake conduit <b>114</b> and a fluid return conduit <b>116</b> (collectively referred to as conduit set <b>115</b>). Fluid intake conduit <b>114</b> illustratively comprises a suction or siphon tube having an inlet end <b>112</b> positionable within the fluid container. Conduit <b>114</b> is configured to supply an inlet paint flow from the inlet end <b>112</b> to the fluid pump mechanism in housing <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, a fluid filter <b>113</b> is mounted at the inlet end <b>112</b> of conduit <b>114</b>. Preferably, inlet end <b>112</b> is positioned at (i.e., in contact with or spaced a small distance away from) the bottom of the fluid container. In this arrangement, conduit <b>114</b> can remove substantially all the contents of the fluid container while minimizing the possibility of air entering inlet end <b>112</b> during operation of sprayer <b>100</b>. Fluid return conduit <b>116</b> illustratively comprises a return tube providing a return path from housing <b>102</b> for paint and/or air, for example during priming of the fluid pump mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Housing <b>102</b> is supported by a pump assembly frame <b>104</b> comprising a housing support assembly <b>118</b> connected to a frame base <b>120</b>. Assembly <b>118</b> comprises a platform supporting housing <b>102</b> at an elevated position above a support surface <b>122</b> (such as a floor of a worksite) on which base <b>120</b> is positioned. Intake conduit <b>114</b> depends from a bottom of housing <b>102</b> and into an interior of the paint container. In the illustrated embodiment, frame base <b>120</b> includes a pair of wheels <b>124</b> connected by an axle <b>126</b>. Axle <b>126</b> is mounted at ends of a pair of downwardly extending legs <b>128</b>, which are attached to housing support assembly <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, legs <b>128</b> are formed as separate components, each being mounted to platform <b>118</b> individually. In the illustrated embodiment, legs <b>128</b> are integral, formed of a single unitary body. In this manner, legs <b>128</b> form a support structure that is substantially U-shaped. Assembly <b>118</b> is secured to legs <b>128</b> such that the platform formed by assembly <b>118</b> is substantially parallel to support surface <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Frame base <b>120</b> includes a second pair of legs <b>130</b> that are connected to the first pair of legs <b>128</b>. A first end <b>132</b> of each leg <b>130</b> is configured to engage surface <b>122</b>. A second end <b>133</b> of each leg <b>130</b> is configured to accommodate a handle <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, the second end <b>133</b> of each leg <b>130</b> comprises a handle adjustment mechanism <b>135</b> that slidably receives a portion of handle <b>134</b> therein. Handle <b>134</b> is configured to telescope from the second end <b>133</b> of legs <b>130</b> in directions <b>136</b>, thereby enabling a user to adjust the height of handle <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, handle adjustment mechanism <b>135</b> comprises a locking mechanism <b>138</b> that is configured to engage and secure handle <b>134</b>. In one example, locking mechanism <b>138</b> comprises a spring loaded button having a pin that is selectively insertable into one of a series of holes formed in handle <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are front and side views, respectively, of portable fluid pump assembly <b>101</b>. As shown, housing <b>102</b> is supported on housing support assembly <b>118</b> of frame <b>104</b> at an elevated position above support surface <b>122</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a length of fluid intake conduit <b>114</b> is such that inlet end <b>112</b> is positioned in close proximity to support surface <b>122</b>, when legs <b>130</b> are positioned on support surface <b>122</b>. In other embodiments, the length of fluid intake conduit <b>114</b> can be longer or shorter (i.e., smaller or larger gaps between inlet end <b>112</b> and surface <b>122</b>). Preferably, the length of fluid intake conduit <b>114</b> is such that inlet end <b>112</b> is positioned at the bottom of the fluid container.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Pump assembly <b>101</b> includes one or more fluid container support features configured to accommodate a fluid container under support assembly <b>118</b>. For example, the fluid container support features include one or more fluid container holders each configured to suspend a fluid container from assembly <b>118</b>. For instance, an exemplary fluid container holder is configured to suspend a fluid container above surface <b>122</b> when a user tilts assembly <b>101</b> backward on wheels <b>124</b> (i.e., in direction <b>142</b>), for example to move assembly <b>101</b> about a worksite. This enables the user to easily transport assembly <b>101</b> without requiring the user to remove and separately carry the fluid container. Further, the one or more fluid container holders are configured such that the inlet end <b>112</b> of intake conduit <b>114</b> is positioned within the interior of the paint container proximate (i.e., near and/or in contact with) an interior bottom surface of the paint container. In one example, a height of a fluid container holder from surface <b>122</b> is such that a fluid container is suspended therefrom with a small gap between the fluid container and surface <b>122</b>, when legs <b>130</b> are also supported on surface <b>122</b> (i.e., the user is not tilting assembly <b>101</b>). In another example, a height of a fluid container holder from surface <b>122</b> is such that the fluid container rests on surface <b>122</b>, when legs <b>130</b> are also supported on surface <b>122</b> (i.e., the user is not tilting assembly <b>101</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with one embodiment, assembly <b>101</b> includes a plurality of fluid container support features configured to accommodate fluid containers of different sizes. This is advantageous as it enables greater user flexibility in selecting and using paint sources (e.g., a user can use either one gallon or five gallon paint containers, for example). Because different sized containers can be utilized, the user is not required to transfer paint from one container to another, for example if paint is only available in one type of container. In contrast, when using conventional sprayers that only accommodate a single paint container size, a user must transfer (i.e., pour) paint from one container to another if the user does not have a full paint container of the correct size. This is time consuming and can result in spillage, which can result in waste and require cleanup.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Frame <b>104</b> illustratively includes a first fluid container holder <b>140</b> configured to accommodate fluid containers having a first size. In one example, holder <b>140</b> is configured to receive a fluid container having the same (or similar) dimensions to a conventional five-gallon pail such that intake conduit <b>114</b> is properly positioned in the fluid container. One example of a fluid container is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As shown, fluid container <b>600</b> includes a body <b>601</b> having an interior for holding fluid (e.g., paint). A bail <b>602</b> comprises a handle <b>604</b>, and is attached to and extends from body <b>601</b>. Container <b>600</b> has a height <b>606</b> from a bottom surface <b>608</b> to handle <b>604</b> of bail <b>602</b>. In one particular example, height <b>606</b> is approximately 20 inches. It is noted that this is one example of a container for use with container holder <b>140</b> and is not intended to limit the scope of the concepts described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in one embodiment fluid container holder <b>140</b> is rigidly attached to and extends from assembly <b>118</b>. Holder <b>140</b> includes a top surface <b>141</b> configured to receive and support bail <b>602</b> of container <b>600</b> thereon. Holder <b>140</b> also includes a vertically extending portion <b>143</b> to retain bail <b>602</b> on holder <b>140</b>. In one embodiment, a height <b>147</b> from surface <b>141</b> to support surface <b>122</b> is based on the height <b>606</b> of container <b>600</b> to be supported on holder <b>140</b>. For example, height <b>147</b> can be the same as height <b>606</b>. In another example, height <b>147</b> is slightly less than, or is slightly greater than, height <b>606</b>. In one particular example, height <b>147</b> is approximately 19 to 20 inches. In this manner, when frame base <b>120</b> rests on surface <b>122</b> fluid container <b>600</b> also rests on surface <b>122</b>, thereby removing some or all of the weight of container <b>600</b> from holder <b>140</b>. The height of vertically extending portion <b>143</b> is sufficient to retain bail <b>602</b> on holder <b>140</b>. In one embodiment, the height of portion <b>143</b> is approximately 0.5 to 1 inch. To remove container <b>600</b> from holder <b>140</b>, a user lifts container <b>600</b> upwardly to lift bail <b>602</b> over portion <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Frame <b>104</b> illustratively includes a second fluid container holder <b>144</b> configured to accommodate fluid containers having a second, different size. In one example, holder <b>144</b> is configured to receive a fluid container having the same (or similar) dimensions to a conventional one-gallon pail such that intake conduit <b>114</b> is properly positioned in the fluid container. One example of a fluid container is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As shown, fluid container <b>700</b> includes a body <b>701</b> having an interior for holding fluid (e.g., paint). A bail <b>702</b> is attached to and extends from body <b>701</b>. Container <b>700</b> has a height <b>706</b> from a bottom surface <b>708</b> to an apex <b>704</b> of bail <b>702</b>. In one particular example, height <b>706</b> is approximately 10.75 inches. It is noted that this is one example of a container for use with container holder <b>144</b> and is not intended to limit the scope of the concepts described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, fluid container holder <b>144</b> is attached to a portion of assembly <b>118</b> and includes a container engaging portion <b>170</b>. A container support surface (generally represented by arrow <b>171</b>) is configured to receive and support bail <b>702</b> of container <b>700</b> thereon. In one embodiment, a height <b>146</b> from surface <b>171</b> to support surface <b>122</b> is based on the height <b>706</b> of container <b>700</b> to be supported on holder <b>144</b>. For example, in one embodiment, height <b>146</b> is the same as height <b>706</b>. In another example, height <b>146</b> is slightly less than, or is slightly greater than, height <b>706</b>. In one particular example, height <b>146</b> is approximately 10 to 10.75 inches. In this manner, when frame base <b>120</b> rests on surface <b>122</b> fluid container <b>700</b> also rests on surface <b>122</b>, thereby removing some or all of the weight of container <b>700</b> from holder <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In accordance with one embodiment, container holder <b>144</b> is movable between a first, extended position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) and a second, retracted position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Holder <b>144</b> is rotatably connected to a portion of assembly <b>118</b> and is configured to pivot about an axis <b>150</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>). Further, frame <b>104</b> includes one or more locking features for retaining holder <b>144</b> in the second position. Such features include, but are not limited to, latches, hooks, notches, and/or straps.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the first position, portion <b>170</b> of container holder <b>144</b> is positioned below assembly <b>118</b> and near and/or in contact with intake conduit <b>114</b>. In the first position, container holder <b>144</b> is configured to accommodate a fluid container with fluid intake conduit <b>114</b> disposed within the fluid container. In the second position, container holder <b>144</b> of portion <b>170</b> is positioned near assembly <b>118</b> and is located away from intake conduit <b>114</b>. In the second position, container holder <b>144</b> does not interfere with use of a fluid container hung from container holder <b>140</b>. A user can selectively utilize fluid container holder <b>144</b> (depending on the particular fluid container size being used) by moving container holder <b>144</b> between the first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref> illustrate one embodiment of housing support assembly <b>118</b> and container holder <b>144</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a perspective view of assembly <b>118</b> and holder <b>144</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> are side views illustrating holder <b>144</b> in an extended position and retracted position, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated, assembly <b>118</b> forms a platform having a substantially planar top portion <b>161</b> and a pair of downwardly extending sidewalls <b>163</b>. Container holder <b>140</b> is attached to and extends from wall <b>165</b> of housing support assembly <b>118</b>. Container holder <b>144</b> includes a pair of arms <b>160</b>. A first end <b>162</b> of arms <b>160</b> are positioned through apertures <b>164</b> formed in sidewalls <b>163</b> of assembly <b>118</b>, such that holder <b>144</b> is pivotable with respect to assembly <b>118</b> about axis <b>150</b>. Holder <b>144</b> is configured to be pivoted about axis <b>150</b> in directions <b>151</b> and <b>153</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to move holder <b>144</b> to the retracted and extended positions, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the first end <b>162</b> of each arm <b>160</b> is angled downwardly to retain the end <b>162</b> within the corresponding aperture <b>164</b> during use. Container engaging portion <b>170</b> is mounted on a second end <b>167</b> of each arm <b>160</b>. In one embodiment, portion <b>170</b> and arms <b>160</b> are integral, formed of a single unitary body.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in one embodiment, the container engaging portion <b>170</b> of holder <b>144</b> has an opening <b>174</b> formed by a plurality of curved sections <b>172</b> that is configured to accommodate conduit set <b>115</b>. In one embodiment, the container engaging portion <b>170</b> has a pair of lateral support bars <b>180</b> positioned on opposing sides of conduit set <b>115</b>. Conduit set <b>115</b> is supported by lateral bars <b>180</b> and a curved bar <b>182</b> that are between. In one embodiment, the curved bar <b>182</b> supports a first side of conduit set <b>115</b> and lateral bars <b>180</b> extend beyond a plain that is tangential to a second, opposite side of conduit set <b>115</b> and form the container support surface <b>171</b>. In one embodiment, a distance <b>184</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) between curved bar <b>182</b> and an edge of arm <b>160</b> against which a bail of a fluid container contacts when resting on support surface <b>171</b> is similar to, a width of fluid intake conduit <b>114</b>. In another embodiment, distance <b>184</b> is greater than the width of conduit <b>184</b>. In this manner, width <b>184</b> accommodates suction set <b>115</b> such that the bail of the fluid container does not exert a significant force against suction set <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the extended position container engaging portion <b>170</b> is angled upwardly to securely retain the bail (i.e., bail <b>704</b>) of the container (i.e., container <b>700</b>) thereon. In one embodiment, portion <b>170</b> is oriented at an angle <b>173</b> (i.e. above a horizontal plane) of approximately 20 degrees. In other embodiments, angle <b>173</b> can be greater than, or less than, approximately 20 degrees. In this manner, when the bail of the container is supported on container support surface <b>171</b> the bail also rests against arms <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the portion of each arm <b>160</b> between the first end <b>162</b> and the second end <b>167</b> is substantially straight. In the illustrated embodiment, each arm <b>160</b> has one or more curves or bends. In this manner, a point (generally represented by reference numeral <b>166</b>) along a first arm <b>160</b> between the first end <b>162</b> and second end <b>167</b> is spaced closer to the other arm <b>160</b> than other points along the first arm <b>160</b> (i.e., distance <b>168</b> is shorter than distances <b>173</b> and <b>175</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, points <b>166</b> are positioned closer to the second end <b>167</b> of arms <b>160</b> than the first end <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When holder <b>144</b> is moved to the retracted position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), points <b>166</b> of arms <b>160</b> are configured to engage sidewalls <b>163</b> at apertures <b>169</b>. In one embodiment, a distance <b>176</b> between the outwardly facing surfaces of sidewalls <b>163</b> is greater than the distance <b>168</b> between points <b>166</b> of arms <b>160</b>. Thus, the shape of arms <b>160</b> operate to retain arms <b>160</b> against sidewalls <b>163</b> and require a force exerted by the user to disengage arms from apertures <b>169</b> to move holder <b>144</b> to the extended position.</p>
