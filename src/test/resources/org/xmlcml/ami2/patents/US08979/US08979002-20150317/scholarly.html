      <p>A manual compressed-air spraying device comprising a head in which are fixed an air
         nozzle forming a venturi and an output nozzle is disclosed. The head delimits, between
         the venturi and the output nozzle, a mixing chamber into which directly opens a conduit
         for channelling product to be sprayed. The output nozzle presents a convergent section
         and a divergent section downstream of the convergent section.

         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</h1>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 7,080,761 describes an example of such a spraying device, wherein the
            product to be sprayed must follow a complex and narrow path between the conduit for
            channeling and the output conduit, in such a way that this type of spraying device
            can possibly operate for spraying a liquid product, but not for spraying a powdery
            product.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0012">In addition, the form of the output conduit disclosed in this document is also not
            suited for the spraying of powdery product.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0013">Finally, the air nozzle of this document has a form that is entirely not suited for
            the effective carrying out of a vacuum capable of sucking the product to be sprayed.

         <h1>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</h1>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0014">This invention has in particular for purpose to overcome these disadvantages.</p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0015">To this effect, according to the invention, a spraying device of the type in question
            is characterized in that the head delimits a mixing chamber between the air nozzle
            and the output nozzle, said mixing chamber forming said vacuum zone and being arranged
            directly above the conduit for channeling, in that the venturi comprises a convergent
            section, and in that the output conduit comprises a divergent section open towards
            the exterior and a convergent section open towards the mixing chamber upstream of
            the divergent section.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0016">Thanks to these arrangements, the spraying device according to the invention is adapted
            to effectively spray powdery products, as well as liquid products. In addition, the
            form of the Venturi, provided with a convergent section, allows for effective suction
            of the product to be sprayed.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0017">In various embodiments of the spraying device according to the invention, further
            recourse is possible to one and/or the other of the following arrangements:
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>

                     <li>the output conduit comprises an inlet cone open towards the mixing chamber, said inlet
                        cone being arranged upstream of said convergent section of the output conduit and
