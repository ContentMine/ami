<p id="p-0024" num="0049">This powdery product, in particular a composition in the form of free perfumed cosmetic powder, can for example have a granulometry between a few micrometers and 200 &#x3bc;m, and a density between 0.6 and 1. This entails for example a mineral powder (such as mica, mineral pigments, etc.) or an organic powder (polyamide, PMMA or other), or a mixture of such mineral and organic powders. This product can also contain a mixed powder such as for example organic coloring agents fixed on a mineral support.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0050">Note that the bulb <b>4</b> can for example comprise an air inlet valve <b>4</b><i>a </i>allowing the air to enter into the bulb <b>4</b> when it inflates via elasticity, but preventing the air outlet towards the exterior when a user presses said bulb <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0051">As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, the distributor <b>2</b> can comprise a head <b>107</b> which can for example be molded of plastic material.

<p id="p-0028" num="0053">The head <b>107</b> is crossed by a nozzle housing <b>110</b> which, in the example shown in the drawings, has a general form of a revolution around a substantially horizontal axis X, for example a cylindrical form.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0054">The head <b>107</b> further comprises a well <b>114</b> extending according to a substantially vertical axis Z, which opens directly upwards in a mixing chamber <b>119</b> delimited by the nozzle housing <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0034" num="0061">In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, a tip <b>122</b>, which can be for example molded from plastic material, is nested by force in the tip housing <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0062">As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tip <b>122</b> comprises a front end <b>123</b> and a rear end <b>124</b> whereon the bulb <b>4</b> is fixed in a sealed manner.

<p id="p-0037" num="0066">At the front end <b>112</b> of the nozzle housing is furthermore nested by force an output nozzle <b>132</b> which delimits the output conduit <b>120</b>, this output nozzle <b>132</b> also being nested by force in the recess arranged across from the output <b>3</b> in the added external envelope <b>31</b>. The output nozzle <b>132</b> does not extend to the contact of the air nozzle <b>116</b>, in such a way that these two nozzles leave in the nozzle housing <b>110</b> a free space which constitutes the aforementioned mixing chamber <b>119</b>. The output nozzle <b>132</b> can comprise at its front end, an external collar <b>132</b><i>a </i>which abuts against the external envelope <b>31</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0079">The convergent section <b>118</b> of the air nozzle <b>116</b>, forms a venturi which defines a vacuum zone corresponding substantially to the mixing chamber <b>119</b>, which is pressurized when air circulates in the air circuit from upstream towards downstream. Due to the fact that the venturi is formed in a part molded from synthetic material, its form is perfectly defined and can be reproduced from one spraying device to the other, independently of any mounting tolerance, in such a way that the vacuum created by the venturi is also perfectly defined.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0080">In the particular case shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, the air inlet conduit <b>127</b> is cylindrical, of diameter D<b>1</b> for example between 2 and 3 mm (in particular of a magnitude of 2.3 mm) and the minimum diameter D<b>2</b> of the convergent section <b>118</b> is for example between 0.5 and 0.7 mm (in particular of a magnitude of 0.6 mm). The ratio of the diameters D<b>1</b>/D<b>2</b> can be between 10% and 25% or, more generally, the ratio between the area of the corresponding sections can be between 1% and 6.5%. The angle at the top &#x3b1; of the convergent section <b>118</b> can for example be between 20 and 40 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0081">In light of the fact that the head <b>107</b> can where applicable be covered by a decorative added external envelope <b>31</b>, the head <b>107</b> is independent of the exterior style of the spraying device <b>1</b>. In addition, the air nozzle <b>116</b> and the output nozzle <b>132</b> can themselves be standard parts used on several types of sprayers <b>1</b>, independently not only in relation to the exterior style of the spraying device <b>1</b>, but also to the type of head <b>107</b> (several types of head <b>107</b> can be used according to the applications, in particular in order to adapt to several types of reservoirs <b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0082">A modular device can as such be manufactured comprised of a small number of thermoplastic parts which are simple to produce, and which implement all of the functions of the connection to the compressed air generator, venturi, channeling product, fixing on a recipient, product output, etc. These parts are assembled for example by simple nesting in relation to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0083">The device which has just been described operates as follows. When a user presses the bulb <b>4</b>, the inlet valve <b>4</b><i>a </i>of this bulb remains closed and the air contained in the bulb is compressed and insufflated into the distributor <b>2</b>, by following the air circuit of this distributor. Subsequent to its passing in the venturi formed by the convergent section <b>118</b>, the air flow creates a vacuum (by decreasing the pressure for example by 20 to 40 mbar [i.e. the equivalent of a column of 20 to 40 cm of water] in relation to the ambient pressure).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0084">This vacuum sucks the powdery product via the dip tube. If the powdery product has agglomerates, these possible agglomerates are disintegrated by the front end <b>116</b><i>a </i>in the form of a point which protrudes into the mixing chamber <b>119</b> above the conduit for channeling delimited by the dip tube <b>15</b> (this front end in the form of a point does not however hinder the arrival of the powdery product in the mixing chamber <b>119</b> due to the form of a point of this front end and due to the fact that it does not fully overhang the section of passing of the conduit for channeling.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0085">Note that the spraying device according to the invention makes it possible to spray a substantially constant dose of powdery product, right from the first actuating of the bulb <b>4</b>, and this, regardless of the level of product <b>6</b> in the reservoir <b>5</b>, as soon as the lower end of the dip tube <b>15</b> dips into the product <b>6</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0087">The distributor <b>2</b> comprises a head <b>307</b> which can for example be molded from plastic material and which can in particular be fixed by clipping-on or other on the neck <b>8</b> of the reservoir <b>5</b>, a seal <b>9</b> able to be, where applicable, interposed between the head <b>7</b> and the neck <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0088">In the head <b>7</b> is arranged a cylindrical nozzle housing <b>310</b> which opens towards the exterior at a front end <b>312</b>. The nozzle housing <b>310</b> extends according to a substantially horizontal axis X from the front end <b>312</b> to a rear end <b>311</b> where said nozzle housing is extended upwards by a shaft <b>311</b><i>a </i>of which the lateral wall protrudes upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0089">The head <b>307</b> comprises as hereinabove, a well <b>314</b> which opens upwards in the nozzle housing <b>310</b> and which extends downwards, in parallel to a substantially vertical axis Z. In the well <b>314</b> can be nested a dip tube <b>15</b> made of plastic material or other, which extends downwards by dipping into the product to be sprayed <b>6</b> contained in the reservoir <b>5</b>. The dip tube <b>15</b> as such comprises, as hereinabove, a conduit for channeling product to be sprayed towards a mixing chamber <b>319</b> delimited on the inside by the nozzle housing <b>310</b>, above the well <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0090">At the rear end <b>311</b> of the nozzle housing is nested by force an air nozzle <b>316</b> which is molded of a single part of synthetic material, in particular thermoplastic. The air nozzle <b>316</b> has an exterior cylindrical form that is complementary to the interior form of the nozzle housing <b>310</b>, and it delimits interiorly a cylindrical air inlet conduit <b>327</b> of diameter D<b>1</b>, centered on the axis X. This inlet conduit <b>327</b> is extended, to 90 degrees upwards, inside the shaft <b>311</b><i>a</i>, passing through a hole <b>316</b><i>b </i>arranged at the rear end of the air nozzle <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0091">The air inlet conduit <b>327</b> is extended towards the front, in the air nozzle <b>316</b>, by a tapered convergent section <b>318</b> which can have an angle at the top for example between 20 and 40 degrees and which is extended by a short narrowed passage <b>318</b><i>b </i>of diameter D<b>2</b>, arranged at the front end <b>316</b><i>a </i>of the air nozzle. The diameters D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> can be similar to the diameters already described in the first embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0092">The front end <b>316</b><i>a </i>of the air nozzle can be in the form of a point, in particular in a tapered form, and protrudes into the aforementioned mixing chamber <b>319</b>, above the well <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0093">Moreover, at the front end <b>312</b> of the nozzle housing is nested by force an output nozzle <b>332</b> of which the rear end arrives at the limit of the mixing chamber <b>319</b> and of which the front end comprises an exterior collar <b>332</b><i>a </i>coming to abut against the exterior lateral wall of the head <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0094">The output nozzle <b>332</b> delimits the output conduit <b>320</b> which can for example comprise a convergent inlet cone <b>320</b><i>a </i>open towards the mixing chamber <b>319</b>, followed by a convergent section <b>320</b><i>b </i>then where applicable by a short cylindrical passage of transition and finally by a divergent section <b>320</b><i>c </i>opening towards the exterior on the outlet orifice <b>3</b>, diameter D<b>3</b>. The form and the dimensions of the outlet passage <b>320</b> and of the outlet orifice <b>3</b> can be identical or similar in form and in dimension of the output passage <b>120</b> and of the outlet orifice <b>3</b> of the second embodiment described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0095">Moreover, on the aforementioned shaft <b>311</b><i>a</i>, can be nested a tip <b>322</b> belonging to a part <b>334</b> which can be molded of plastic material. The tip <b>322</b> has a general cylindrical form of revolution centered on a vertical axis parallel to the axis Z and extends upwards to a tapered portion which converges upwards by forming a valve seat <b>326</b>. The valve seat <b>326</b> is normally sealed by a valve member <b>29</b> solicited upwards par coiled spring <b>30</b> pressing against the upper end of the shaft <b>311</b><i>a</i>. The valve member <b>29</b> and the spring <b>30</b> can be identical or similar to those already described hereinabove. The valve member <b>29</b> forms with the spring <b>30</b> and the valve seat <b>326</b> an air inlet valve <b>28</b> which allows only the entry of the air in the air inlet conduit <b>327</b>, through a recess <b>326</b><i>a </i>arranged in the center of the valve seat <b>326</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0096">The part <b>334</b> made of plastic material forms moreover a substantially horizontal piston <b>335</b> and has for example a form of a disk centered on the axis Z.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0097">The piston <b>335</b> can comprise exteriorly one or several peripheral lips <b>336</b> whereon is nested a push-button <b>337</b> in the form of an inverted cup, made for example by molding of plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0098">The push-button <b>337</b> can comprise for example an upper bottom <b>338</b> extended downwards by a cylindrical skirt <b>339</b> centered on the axis Z, the interior wall <b>339</b><i>a </i>of this skirt sliding sealingly on the peripheral lips <b>336</b> of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0099">At its lower end, the cylindrical skirt <b>339</b> of the push-button is extended radially towards the exterior, by a flange ring <b>339</b><i>b </i>(or where applicable by exterior prongs) which is guided by vertical sliding, without sealing, by the cylindrical interior surface <b>340</b><i>a </i>of an annular lateral wall <b>340</b> centered on the axis Z, which can be formed of a single part with the head <b>307</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0100">The annular lateral wall <b>340</b> comprises, at its upper end, an interior rim <b>341</b> (continuous or discontinuous) against which abuts the flange ring <b>339</b><i>b </i>upwards, in order to limit the sliding upwards of the push-button <b>337</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0101">In the piston <b>335</b> can furthermore be formed an air inlet valve <b>342</b> which allows only the entry of air from the exterior, via the space located below the piston <b>335</b>, towards the space delimited between the piston <b>335</b> and the push-button <b>337</b>. This valve <b>342</b> can comprise for example an orifice <b>344</b> of tapered form, expanded upwards, which delimits as such a valve seat <b>345</b> against which is applied a valve member <b>343</b> which can for example be formed by a tab molded from a single part with the piston <b>335</b> and connected to this piston by a zone forming a hinge <b>343</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0102">Moreover, coiled spring <b>346</b> is interposed between the piston <b>335</b> and the bottom <b>338</b> of the push-button <b>337</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0103">Finally, the piston <b>335</b> can be supported by two cylindrical tubular supports <b>347</b> which extend downwards according to the axis Z starting from the lower surface of said piston and which are nested by force on two cylindrical tenons <b>348</b> molded from a single part with the head <b>307</b> and extending upwards starting from said head (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0104">The device that has just been described operates as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0105">When a user presses on the push-button <b>337</b>, against the solicitation of the spring <b>346</b>, he compresses the air contained in the chamber which is delimited between the piston <b>335</b> and the push-button <b>337</b>, in such a way that this compressed air is expulsed through the air inlet valve <b>28</b>, towards the air inlet conduit <b>327</b>, then the convergent section <b>318</b> forming venturi, then the mixing chamber <b>319</b> where a vacuum is produced sucking upwards the powdery product <b>6</b> contained inside the reservoir <b>5</b>. This powdery product is mixed with the air flow inside the chamber <b>319</b>, and then sprayed towards the exterior through the output conduit <b>320</b> as explained hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0106">When the user releases the push-button <b>337</b>, the latter returns to its initial position under the solicitation of the spring <b>346</b>. During this movement, the air inlet valve <b>28</b> remains closed, but the valve <b>342</b> opens, allowing the entry of air into the chamber delimited between the piston <b>335</b> and the push-button <b>337</b>.</p>
