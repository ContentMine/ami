         <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
         <p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a process for recycling used absorbent sanitary products.</p>
         <p id="p-0005" num="0004">By the term “absorbent sanitary products” is meant in general disposable absorbent
            products, such as: baby diapers, incontinence absorbent pads, ladies sanitary pads,
            bed mats, etc.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
         <p id="p-0007" num="0006">Absorbent sanitary products are generally made up of a wide range of different materials,
            amongst which sheets of plastic material, cellulose fluff, superabsorbent polymers,
            sheets of non-woven fabric, etc.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0008" num="0007">Absorbent sanitary products contain high-quality materials such as plastic and cellulose,
            and it would be desirable to recover said materials to use them in a new production
            cycle or else for the production of energy.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0009" num="0008">Currently, used absorbent sanitary products are disposed of as undifferentiated waste
            to be sent to rubbish dumps. The component materials of used absorbent sanitary products
            are not recovered in the first place because the various materials (cellulose fibres,
            superabsorbent polymers, sheets of plastic material, etc.) are intimately interconnected,
            and to obtain separation of the materials it would be necessary to carry out a complete
            destructuring of the products. In addition, used absorbent sanitary products contain
            organic excretions and bacteria, and it would be necessary to carry out a sterilization
            of the products prior to recycling of the materials.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0010" num="0009">For the above reasons, used absorbent sanitary products are not included amongst recyclable
            waste products for which differentiated collection is carried out.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is estimated that absorbent sanitary products constitute approximately 2-3% of
            the total of urban solid waste. However, where a differentiated collection is carried
            out with a high percentage of differentiation of the waste (with a percentage of differentiated
            waste higher than 60% of the total) the percentage of absorbent sanitary products
            with respect to the remaining part constituted by the undifferentiated residual fraction
            rises to approximately 20%.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0012" num="0011">The high percentage of absorbent sanitary products with respect to the residual fraction
            of non-recyclable waste renders highly desirable the availability of equipment and
            processes that enable a treatment of absorbent sanitary products to be carried out
            aimed at recycling their component materials in an efficient and economically convenient
            way.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0013" num="0012">Currently known techniques for treatment of used absorbent sanitary products are not
            satisfactory. A first known technique envisages carrying out washing of the used absorbent
            products with water, alkalis, and soap and separating the cellulose from the plastic
            during the washing operation. Examples of this technique are disclosed in the documents
            Nos. WO 94/20668 and WO 96/27045.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0014" num="0013">The document No. U.S. Pat. No. 5,292,075 describes a process in which the dirty absorbent
            sanitary products are preliminarily shredded. The shredded material is then washed
            in a washing machine comprising a perforated cylindrical drum that withholds the plastic
            material inside it. The material containing the cellulose pulp is then dehydrated.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0015" num="0014">These techniques of treatment of absorbent sanitary products are in actual practice
            problematical to implement since the washing water would contain a high amount of
            pollutants, such as gelified superabsorbent polymers and organic residue, which renders
            problematical disposal thereof. Drying of the cellulose after washing moreover entails
            a high expenditure of energy.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further difficulty derives from the fact that used absorbent sanitary products are
            normally thrown away folded and closed to form a pack, with the outer plastic layer
            of the products that forms an impermeable barrier. If the products are treated in
            the form in which they have been thrown away, the outer impermeable layer prevents
            an effective sterilization of the products. On the other hand, a preliminary treatment
            as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,292,075 entails the need to shred articles with a
            high content of organic excretions, bacteria, and contaminants.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0017" num="0016">The document No. JP 2004113915 describes a process for treating diapers that contain
            absorbent polymers, whereby the used diapers are set in a pressurized closed vessel
            together with sawdust. Inside the vessel the diapers are treated with steam at high
            temperature and high pressure for a pre-set time. Steam treatment is carried out at
            a pressure of 15-25 atm and at a temperature of 150-250° C. This document envisages
            use of the absorbent sanitary products, after said treatment, as fertilizers following
            upon fermentation.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0018" num="0017">The document No. WO 2010/065088 describes an autoclave for the treatment of urban
            solid waste that envisages drying of the waste using steam. The apparatus described
            in the document WO 2010/065088 comprises a rotary cylindrical autoclave provided with
            at least one hatch that can be opened to enable access to the autoclave and sealably
            closed to enable pressurization of the autoclave, an inlet for contact steam that
            comes into direct contact with the waste contained inside the autoclave, a plurality
            of straight hollow blades, which are designed to conduct non-contact steam, project
            from the inner surface of the autoclave, and are supplied with non-contact steam.
            This apparatus enables sterilization of urban solid waste and drying of the waste
            during treatment in the autoclave. The apparatus described in the document WO 2010/065088
            has been developed for treatment of undifferentiated urban solid waste and does not
            contains specific teachings to obtain sterilization, drying, and separation of the
            component materials of absorbent sanitary products.

         <h1>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</h1>
         <p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to figref[FIG. 1]
            	, designated by 
            <b>10</b> is a rotary-autoclave apparatus for treating used absorbent sanitary products. The
            apparatus 
            <b>10</b> comprises a stationary structure 
            <b>12</b>, which carries a cylindrical autoclave 
            <b>14</b> that turns about its longitudinal axis A. The apparatus 
            <b>10</b> comprises a driving device (not illustrated), which drives the autoclave 
            <b>14</b> in rotation about the axis A. The supporting structure 
            <b>12</b> may be provided with actuators 
            <b>16</b> for varying the inclination of the autoclave 
            <b>14</b> with respect to a horizontal axis, which enables tilting of the autoclave 
            <b>14</b> between a loading/unloading position and a working position. The autoclave 
            <b>14</b> has two ends, at least one of which terminates in a hatch that can be opened to enable
            access to the internal space of the autoclave and sealably closed to enable pressurization
            of the internal space. In the example illustrated two openable hatches 
            <b>18</b>, 
            <b>20</b> are provided, which can be used, for example, for loading the autoclave with the
            products to be treated and for unloading the treated products. Alternatively, a single
            openable hatch could be provided, which can be used both for loading and for unloading.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0026" num="0025">The apparatus 
            <b>10</b> comprises a circuit for heating and pressurizing the autoclave 
            <b>14</b> in order to heat the absorbent sanitary products to a sterilization temperature.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0027" num="0026">The hatches 
            <b>18</b>, 
            <b>20</b> are provided with respective rotary connectors 
            <b>34</b>, 
            <b>36</b> for inlet and outlet of heating steam coming from a steam generator 
            <b>38</b>. The flow of heating steam can be divided into a flow of non-contact steam 
            <b>42</b> that traverses ducts located on the inner wall of the autoclave 
            <b>14</b> and a flow of contact steam 
            <b>44</b> that comes into direct contact with the products to be treated and pressurizes the
            internal volume of the autoclave 
            <b>14</b>. On the outlet connector 
            <b>36</b> the flow of non-contact steam 
            <b>42</b> and the flow of contact steam 
            <b>44</b> are divided and treated separately, for example as described in the document No.

         </p>
         <p id="p-0028" num="0027">Typically, absorbent sanitary products comprise an absorbent core of cellulose fibres
            and of superabsorbent polymers. The absorbent core is usually enclosed between two
            sheets of plastic material joined together. Typically, the backsheet is impermeable,
            whereas the topsheet is porous. Used absorbent sanitary products are normally folded
            up so as to enclose the product in the form of a pack within the impermeable backsheet.
            Usually adhesive tabs are provided for closing the folded product. The organic excretions
            are thus enclosed within a sealed sheet of impermeable plastic material.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention envisages carrying out the treatment of absorbent sanitary products
            just as they are collected, i.e., in the form where they are closed to form a pack,
            and without any preliminary treatment for opening the products.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0030" num="0029">To obtain an effective action of drying and sterilization during treatment in the
            autoclave 
            <b>14</b> it is necessary to obtain destructuring of the products so as to expose all the organic
            substances to the sterilization temperature in every point inside the autoclave 
            <b>14</b>. Destructuring of the absorbent sanitary products is absolutely essential to achieve
            a complete sterilization and to separate the plastic from the cellulose fibres.
         </p>
         <p id="p-0031" num="0030">With reference to figref[FIG. 2]
            	, in operation, the autoclave 
            <b>14</b> is loaded with a load of absorbent sanitary products

            elements 
            <b>48</b> may be small and sharp objects such as for example stones or objects coming from
            metalwork such as screws, bolts, lengths of L-sectional steel, etc.

         <p id="p-0034" num="0033">Given that the tearing elements

            available on the wall of the autoclave
