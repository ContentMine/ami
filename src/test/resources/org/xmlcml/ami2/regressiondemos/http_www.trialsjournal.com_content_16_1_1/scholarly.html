                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Research is needed on what influences recruitment to smoking reduction trials, and
                  how to increase their reach. The present study aimed to i) assess the feasibility
                  of recruiting a disadvantaged population, ii) examine the effects of recruitment methods
                  on participant characteristics, iii) identify resource requirements for different
                  recruitment methods, and iv) to qualitatively assess the acceptability of recruitment.
                  This was done as part of a pilot two-arm trial of the effectiveness of a novel behavioral
                  support intervention focused on increasing physical activity and reducing smoking,
                  among disadvantaged smokers not wishing to quit.

                  <h3>Methods</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Smokers were recruited through mailed invitations from three primary care practices
                  (62 participants) and one National Health Stop Smoking Service (SSS) database (31
                  participants). Six other participants were recruited via a variety of other community-based
                  approaches. Data were collected through questionnaires, field notes, work sampling,
                  and databases. Chi-squared and t-tests were used to compare baseline characteristics
                  of participants.

                  <h3>Results</h3>
               </div>
               <p>We randomized between 5.1 and 11.1% of those invited through primary care and SSS,
                  with associated researcher time to recruit one participant varying from 18 to 157
                  minutes depending on time and intensity invested.Only six participants were recruited
                  through a wide variety of other community-based approaches, with an associated researcher
                  time of 469 minutes to recruit one participant. Targets for recruiting a disadvantaged
                  population were met, with 91% of the sample in social classes C2 to E (NRS social
                  grades, UK), and 41% indicating mental health problems. Those recruited from SSS were
                  more likely to respond to an initial letter, had used cessation aids before, and had
                  attempted to quit in the past year. Overall, initial responders were more likely to
                  be physically active than those who were recruited via follow-up telephone calls.
                  No other demographics or behaviour characteristics were associated with recruitment
                  approach or intensity of effort. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants
                  had been attracted by the prospect of support that focused on smoking reduction rather
                  than abrupt quitting.

               </div>
               <p>Mailed invitations, and follow-up, from health professionals was an effective method
                  of recruiting disadvantaged smokers into a trial of an exercise intervention to aid
                  smoking reduction. Recruitment via community outreach approaches was largely ineffective.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Smokers from disadvantaged groups (such as the unemployed, low-skilled manual workers,
         and people with mental health problems) attempt to quit at the same rate as others
         but the success rate in quitting is lower 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. Smoking has been identified as one of the main contributing factors to health inequalities
         in industrial countries 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span> and, in England and Wales, accounts for nearly half the difference of smoking-attributed
         mortality (among males) between the highest and lowest socioeconomic groups 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. Smoking reduction may increase the motivation to quit, which is highly predictive
         of quit attempts, and reduce smoking dependence, which is related to successful quitting
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. Also, offering an intervention to support smoking reduction may increase the reach
         of services to disadvantaged smokers who would not engage in cessation programs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. Offering support for smoking reduction may attenuate the commonly reported barriers
         to engagement of ‘fear of failure’ and ‘fear of being judged’ when attempting to abruptly
         quit 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Evidence for the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions for disadvantaged
         groups is limited 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. The lack of evidence may have resulted from both the inherent difficulties in recruiting
         and engaging with such groups in clinical trials, and the predominant focus on abrupt
         quitting rather than smoking reduction. Further research is therefore needed on how
         best to recruit disadvantaged smokers to increase intervention reach 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span> with appropriate behavioral support 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>
      </p>
      <p>More detailed and transparent information on the reach of trials and interventions
         (such as the proportion of the targeted population that participated) targeting disadvantaged
         groups is needed to better assess and plan interventions 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>. Various approaches may improve recruitment into studies among disadvantaged groups
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>, including the following: engagement with the target population when developing the
         intervention and preparing participant information about the study and intervention,
         using a variety of community networks and settings to invite the target population,
         and use of follow-up telephone calls to explain the study methods and intervention.
         In a review, the most effective strategies for recruiting smokers into trials 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span> suggested that tailored interventions, recruitment methods that are proactive in
         nature (for example, approaching potential participants directly) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>, and more intensive recruitment strategies (such as repeated provision of information
         and contact) may help. But in general there is insufficient knowledge regarding the
         factors influencing recruitment and the most effective strategies for recruiting into
         randomized trials 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>, particularly among disadvantaged groups.

      <p>This article reports on the feasibility and acceptability of strategies specifically
         designed to recruit disadvantaged smokers who wished to reduce their smoking but not
         quit, into a phase two pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial: the Exercise Assisted
         Reduction then Stop (EARS) trial (Health Technology Assessment (HTA) number: 07/78/02,
         International Standardized Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN): 13837944,
         UK Clinical Research Network (UKCRN) Study ID: 8937. The specific objectives of this
         study as related to the present paper were: i) to identify the feasibility of recruiting
         disadvantaged smokers through a variety of settings (through primary care, National
         Health Service (NHS) Stop Smoking Services (SSS), and through more generalized community
         approaches) as well as to examine the effect of using varying degrees of recruitment
         activity intensity (recruitment by invitation letter only compared with an invitation
         letter plus follow-up reminder telephone calls, and through various levels of community
         engagement); ii) to examine how recruitment of participants through different locations
         and different levels of recruitment intensity impact on participant characteristics;
         iii) to identify the time requirements associated with each recruitment approach;
         and iv) to qualitatively explore the effectiveness and acceptability of different
         approaches to recruitment.

      <p>Overall, the trial sought to identify uncertainties about the methods and intervention
         to support smoking reduction with physical activity and behavioral support. The two-arm
         randomized controlled trial consisted of a weekly one-to-one counselling-based intervention
         of up to 12 weeks, supporting self-directed changes in smoking and physical activity
         behaviors, compared with usual care (brief advice on available SSS), among disadvantaged
         smokers wishing to cut down but not quit. Data collection took place at baseline,
         eight weeks, and 16 weeks post baseline. The primary outcome was the number of participants
         achieving confirmed expired air carbon monoxide abstinence at four weeks post-quitting.
         Other outcomes included the number of quit attempts made, the number achieving at
         least 50% reduction in smoking at 16 weeks, changes in physical activity, and various
         other behavioral and process measures. The protocol and main findings of the study
         have been published

            <h3>Locating and defining a disadvantaged population</h3>
         </div>
         <p>We set a target to recruit participants of whom at least 75% were unemployed or in
            social class C2 to E (NRS Social Grades, UK (skilled manual workers, semi-skilled
            and unskilled manual workers, state pensioners, casual and lowest grade workers, and
            those unemployed with state benefits only), 30% were single parents, and 20% had indicators
            of a mental health problem (indicated by answering ‘moderately’ or ‘extremely’ anxious
            or depressed to item five of the EQ-5D questionnaire). These criteria were based on
            the high prevalence of smoking among these groups 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
            </span>. Recruitment took place in the neighborhoods of Devonport and Stonehouse in Plymouth,
            United Kingdom, selected for having high deprivation (index of multiple deprivation
            score of 52 to 59.9, placing them within the 3% ‘most deprived’ areas in England 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
            </span>). Local data indicated that smoking prevalence among adults was over 40%, and the
            location had generally poor health, with a life expectancy 12.6 years lower than some
            other areas of the city

            <h3>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Participants were eligible if they were over 18-years-old, smoked at least 10 cigarettes
            per day (and had done so for at least two years), did not intend to quit in the next
            month, were able to engage in moderate intensity physical activity (walking without
            stopping for at least 15 minutes), were registered with a general practitioner (GP),
            and did not wish to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to reduce smoking. The
            study focus was initially on reducing smoking, not quitting, so those who expressed
            a desire to quit immediately were referred directly to the NHS SSS without entering
            the study. Those wishing to use NRT were excluded to avoid any confounding of the
            effects of physical activity on their smoking behaviour. We excluded those with severe
            mental health problems and ongoing substance misuse due the potential difficulties
            of engaging them in the intervention, given the large uncertainties and complexities
            of its delivery, and those who may have put the safety of the research team at risk.
            Due to the exploratory nature of the study, participants were required to be able
            to converse in English.

            <h3>Recruitment</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Recruitment was over a 12-month-period between May 2011 and May 2012, with a recruitment
            target of 120 smokers. Recruitment was split between two distinct approaches: 1) primary
            care and 2) other community-based approaches.

               <h4>Primary care</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Initially, one primary care medical practice in each of the two neighborhoods was
               identified and approached to be included in the research study; a third practice with
               patients from both areas was approached later in the study in order to expand the
               scope of recruitment to meet the planned sample size. We planned to recruit 50% (n
               = 60) of participants through primary care. GP practice lists were searched based
               on cursory inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Taylor 
               <i>et al</i>., for more details 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
               </span>). A list of potential participants was generated and invitation letters, in batches
               of 100 per practice, were sent every two weeks from the GP with a postal reminder
               a week later. To begin with, postal invitations were sent without making any follow-up
               telephone calls so a response rate to a letter-only invitation could be established.
               Following on from this, and to increase reach to people with low literacy, telephone
               calls were made to those who did not respond directly to the invitation letter to
               check that they had received and understood the invitation, and to explore the effect
               of follow-up calls on increasing recruitment rates. If there was no answer on the
               first call a message was left to enquire if the invitation had been received and to
               leave a contact number for further information. Up to four more calls were made but,
               to avoid harassment, no further messages were left. Interested participants returned
               a form indicating interest in the study or telephoned a researcher. They were then
               screened for eligibility by telephone and provided consent for a researcher to contact
               their GP to confirm eligibility. Once eligibility was confirmed by their GP, the volunteer
               was invited to attend a baseline assessment.

               <h4>Community</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The other 50% (n = 60) of the targeted recruitment was categorized as ‘other community
               approaches’. There were two distinct recruitment methods. The first (for which a target
               of n = 30 was set) involved the searching of the local NHS SSS database for people
               who had used the service within the last two years but had failed to quit. The same
               procedure of mailed invitations and follow-up telephone calls as used for recruitment
               through GP practices was then adopted, without applying the cursory inclusion and
               exclusion criteria in the first instance. The second method involved outreach in an
               attempt to recruit smokers who may not engage with traditional services and may experience
               higher levels of disadvantage. Potential participants were contacted through: workplaces,
               educational sites, community sites, and a range of other media (see Table 
               <span tagx="tblr">1</span>). Interested participants contacted the research team directly (in person) and indirectly
               by telephone or by returning contact details with a request for further information.
               Following screening, to determine eligibility, a time for attending a baseline session
               was arranged.

            <h3>Data collection</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Data collection consisted of four elements:</p>
         <p>1. Number of invitation letters sent, responses received, telephone calls made, participants
            declining participation, participants who were ineligible, and participants entering
            the trial through which recruitment location were all recorded on databases throughout
            the recruitment period, at the recruitment location and individual level, to allow
            conversion rates to be produced by recruitment location and by recruitment activity
            intensity.
         </p>
         <p>2. As part of the main trial, the following data was collected at baseline: demographic
            information (age, sex, cohabiting status, cohabiting with other smokers, whether they
            were the parent of a resident child under 16, job status, age at leaving fulltime
            education, ethnicity, weight, and height), smoking history (age on starting smoking,
            longest period of cessation in the last year, attempts at cutting down, cessation
            aids used in past year, use of SSS, and satisfaction with previous use of SSS), number
            of cigarettes being smoked per day, Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)

            and by accelerometer). In the present paper this data was used to compare the characteristics
            of those recruited through different locations and via different recruitment activity
            intensity.
         </p>
         <p>3. The time spent by the research team on recruitment activity including: searching
            GP and SSS databases for potential participants (including screening potential participants
            for eligibility for GP databases only), preparation and mailing of invitation letters,
            making follow-up phone calls to non-responders to the mailed invitation, contacting
            interested participants to screen for eligibility, and arranging baseline appointments
            were recorded on the trial database. Additional information relating to the time spent
            recruiting through broader community approaches was recorded via researcher activity
            logs, diaries, and work sampling procedures.
         </p>
         <p>4. Qualitative data were collected through a combination of field notes, regular documented
            meetings, audio recorded interviews with the research team, and opportunistic feedback
            from stakeholders. Semi-structured, audio recorded interviews were also completed
            with the use of a topic guide on a purposively sampled range of participants after
            completing the trial to cover a range of demographics and achieved outcomes.

            <h3>Data analyses</h3>
         </div>
         <p>To calculate the conversion rates from invitation to entry into the trial, a percentage
            was derived from the total number of invites sent out via each location and the resulting
            number of randomizations from each location. Conversion rates for broader community
            approaches was not possible to determine due to the open-ended nature of the majority
            of the methods (it is unknown how many people may have read, for example, a flyer
            or poster and therefore it is impossible to derive a denominator).
         </p>
         <p>Pearson’s chi-squared and t-tests (independent, two-sample, and two-tailed) were completed
            for categorical and continuous variables, respectively, to compare characteristics
            of those recruited through primary care and SSS, and to compare those recruited by
            initial invitation letter only or by initial invitation letter plus follow-up telephone
            calls. Statistical analyses were completed using Stata SE (version 12.0, StataCorp
            LP, College Station, Texas, USA).
         </p>
         <p>To calculate time associated with various recruitment methods, the time associated
            with samples of invitations sent to groups of potential participants sent via each
            location which received the same intensity of effort (considered to represent best
            practice) was totalled and divided by the number of participants successfully recruited.
            All time associated with broader community approaches was also totalled and divided
            by the number of participants successfully recruited via these approaches. This resulted
            in a total amount of time spent by the research team per participant randomized. Reasons
            for ineligibility were also recorded.
         </p>
         <p>Qualitative data were analyzed using surface-level thematic analyses and case studies
            in NVivo (version 9 (QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia). Ethical
            approval for the study was granted by the NHS National Research Ethics Service Committee
            South West, in the United Kingdom (Local Research Ethics Committee number: 10/H0106/59).

         <p>The reasons for ineligibility were similar across recruitment methods (Table 
            <span tagx="tblr">5</span>). The main reason for ineligibility (for more than 50% of those ineligible) was due
            to the individual having already quit smoking. A summary of recruitment via different
            locations is shown in Table

                           for recruiting and referring individuals were problematic and at times convoluted
                           (due to data protection). Communication between the research team and IAPT was difficult
                           as there was a sense that the study was a low priority for the practitioners who had
                           other issues to deal with.

         <p>The novel approach of actively promoting support for reduction in smoking was well
            received by the majority of the sample. Many emphasized the appeal of reduction against
            the alternative of stopping abruptly. The appeal of reducing smoking appeared to stem
            from an underlying desire to change behaviour, but due to a lack of confidence or
            desire to stop abruptly, reduction seemed a much more manageable objective:
         </p>
         <p>‘I think that was probably it, the reduction thinking. Well you know, rather than
            sort of go cold turkey and completely stop I thought, “Oh you know, you could help
            me reduce it,” which you did, so you know that obviously it worked.’ 
            <i>(Female, 60 to 65 years, unemployed, moderate smoker, intervention)</i>
         </p>
         <p>‘Yeah it did as well, because I thought, “I don’t really want to, I am not ready to
            stop yet,” and I thought cutting down is quite good.’ 
            <i>(Female, 35 to 40 years, employed part-time, moderate smoker, control)</i>
         </p>
         <p>For some, past experiences of failed quitting heightened the appeal of support for
            reduction as a novel approach to tackling their smoking behaviour:
         </p>
         <p>‘Well, for three or four years I’ve been trying to give up smoking [and] last month
            [I] done 10 months, and then I had a smoke…This one appealed to me because you cut
            down, you know, every week you cut down two cigarettes a week and you just cut down
            and cut down and I eventually got down to none.’ 
            <i>(Male, 60 to 65 years, unemployed, moderate smoker, intervention, successful quitter)</i>
         </p>
         <p>The message in the trial invitation of support to cut down did not appear to threaten
            people’s sense of control over their own behaviour, compared with a message around
            abrupt quitting. For some, it was clear that a pervading message of the need to stop
            smoking would have completely alienated them from engaging in the study:
         </p>
         <p>‘[The researcher] was saying “We can help you to cut down. We may in time be able
            to stop you smoking” and I said “Well, that’s a very sensible attitude to take” because
            someone telling me “I’m going to stop you smoking” I’d tell them to… go away! So that’s
            what made me do it initially, because they weren’t threatening me that they could
            stop me smoking. But even at this time, there is no-one that can tell me “I can stop
            you smoking” you know what I mean?’ 
            <i>(Male, 55 to 60 years, unemployed, heavy smoker, intervention)</i>
         </p>
         <p>The invitation was designed, as was the intervention, to be supportive and client-centered
            and a step away from traditional services, and the supportive and unpressurised nature
            of the invitation was well received:
         </p>
         <p>‘You know, I say, when [the researcher] gave me the leaflet I thought “Yeah, alright,
            I’ve heard all this before” and I thought “Well, here we go with the hard sell”. But
            [they were] totally different. [They were] so relaxed, so friendly, and that’s what
            pushed me towards it. If [they] had tried to come across with the hard sell I would
            most probably have just ignored [them] and said cheerio. But I think just approaching
            people in a friendly manner…I mean, sometimes it helps.’ 
            <i>(Male, 55 to 60 years, employed full time, heavy smoker, intervention)</i>
         </p>
         <p>Negative experiences of using NRT and other medicinal therapies emerged as a strong
            theme linked to motivation for taking part. The intervention was envisaged as a novel
            alternative to NRT, and people’s description of past experiences seemed to confirm
            this particular aspect of the intervention:
         </p>
         <p>‘Oh I’ve tried a couple of times to cut out smoking totally ‘cause I’ve tried the
            smoking aids and all the things you know, the puffer and the patches and that hasn’t
            worked, so I thought “Oh well, I’ll give this a try then try and cut down,” yeah.’
            
            <i>(Male, 40 to 45 years, employed part-time, very heavy smoker, intervention)</i>
         </p>
         <p>The appeal of the invitation to reduce smoking, as opposed to quit, was supported
            by the Health Trainers when interviewed, who identified a desire to reduce smoking
            as the primary factor when asked ‘What attracted participants to the study?’:
         </p>
         <p>‘They’re only coming in because we’ve said reducing smoking, rather than quitting
            and I think that’s what is getting them into the surgery…’ 
            <i>(Health Trainer three)</i>
         </p>
         <p>‘Um, a different approach maybe, slightly different to what they’ve actually done
            before, and I think it wasn’t about quitting, it’s about trying to reduce rather than
            them quitting…’ 
            <i>(Health Trainer two)</i>
         </p>
         <p>Overall, there was a clear indication that the invitation appealed to, and reached,
            people who would not have been interested in support to quit.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>This unique study provides much needed data on the engagement of disadvantaged populations
         with a focus on harm reduction as opposed to abrupt quitting, and provides a systematic
         attempt to assess the effects of increasing intensity of recruitment activity (via
         follow-up telephone calls) and recruitment methods on accessing disadvantaged groups.
      </p>
      <p>Recruitment targets were met for the operational definition of a disadvantaged group
         of 91% in social class C2 to E (target 75%), 41% with an indicated mental health problem
         (target 20%), but failed to reach the proposed target of 30% for single parents (17%
         of sample). This was a particularly difficult group to target, partly due to this
         information not being available from GP and SSS databases, and also due to the difficulty
         in targeting single parents within the community. From the attempts that were made
         to target this sample within the community (parent and toddler groups and school settings)
         no single parents were recruited. More robust and effective methods are needed to
         understand the best way to engage with single parents who smoke. Since conducting
         the study we have become aware of several smoking and harm reduction studies (for
         example, studies cited in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
         guidelines on harm reduction, 2013, and these may provide further ideas on how best
         to recruit single parents. Future ideas for recruitment of single parents may include
         the use of midwifery records which record the smoking status of antenatal women.
      </p>
      <p>The greatest reason (&gt;50%) for ineligibility was an individual having already quit
         smoking, although it is possible that potential participants used this as an excuse
         for not participating. Records of smoking status, held by both GP practices and SSS,
         were obviously dated in terms of the last contact at which they were recorded as smoking,
         thereby increasing the resources needed for inviting and screening.
      </p>
      <p>The sample consisted overall of relatively heavy smokers (with a mean of 20 self-reported
         cigarettes per day, compared with a national average of 12.7 cigarettes per day) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
         </span>, indicating that the invitation to support reduction can recruit heavier smokers,
         building on previous survey data 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">28</span>
         </span>. The sample self-reported high levels of daily physical activity, averaging more
         than the recommended 30 minutes of moderate andvigorous activity per day, although
         objectively measured physical activity suggested that individuals were overestimating
         their levels of activity. There is evidence to suggest that this is fairly typical
         of a disadvantaged population due to higher levels of activity associated with work
         and active transport 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">29</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">30</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">31</span>
         </span>. The higher levels of activity may also reflect self-selection bias; the trial invitation
         referred to an intervention which included physical activity and lifestyle support
         which may have attracted a more active sample. Of those recruited, the gender balance
         was relatively even and similar to levels of engagement within the NHS SSS 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">32</span>
         </span>. Overall, approximately 44% and 56% of all mailed invitations went to males and females
         respectively, indicating very similar recruitment rates for males (7.7%) and females
         (7.4%), suggesting the approach to recruitment and appeal of the invitation is equally
         effective at recruiting both males and females.
      </p>
      <p>Whilst the use of follow-up telephone calls was effective at increasing recruitment
         rates, this increased researcher time (and costs) about five to seven-fold per participant
         recruited. The findings suggest that those recruited via follow-up telephone calls
         represented a harder-to-reach population, being both less likely to have used SSS
         in the past and less physically active. The use of follow-up telephone calls therefore
         may offer added value in reaching the more service-resistant smokers. It is possible
         that the reach of the intervention was higher than indicated in the recruitment rates
         presented; potentially anywhere between 10 and 66% of smokers invited into the study
         were not interested or were ineligible due to having a desire to quit 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">33</span>
         </span>. For example, if 1,000 invites were sent, but potentially 66% of those invited were
         not part of the targeted population, the conversion rates of 5.1 to 11.1% presented
         here may in fact represent 11.6 to 25.2%, allowing for those who were no part of the
         intended targeted population for recruitment.
      </p>
      <p>Differences were observed in those recruited through primary care and SSS predominantly
         in terms of smoking history. Those recruited through SSS were more likely to have
         used cessation aids in the past and more likely to have made a quit attempt in the
         previous 12 months. Another significant difference was that those invited through
         SSS were more likely to respond directly to the letter invitation than to the follow-up
         telephone call. These differences probably reflected a much more motivated group coming
         through SSS, as they had already engaged with a service to help address their smoking
         behaviour and were likely to have contemplated changing smoking behaviour. Of those
         recruited through primary care nearly three quarters (72.6%) had never previously
         engaged with SSS. When considered alongside differences in previous cessation aid
         use and previous quit attempts, this finding suggests that those recruited via primary
         care represented a much harder-to-reach group of smokers than those who had attended
         SSS.
      </p>
      <p>The use of an invitation to receive support to cut down, sent out via primary care,
         could therefore be a valid way of increasing the reach of traditional smoking services.
         The nature of the invitation itself (not being branded as part of the SSS and offering
         support to cut down as opposed to quit) may also have played a large part in increasing
         the interest in participation in the study among those harder-to-reach smokers, and
         qualitative data supported this premise. There appears to be value in the invitation
         as a successful ‘smoking cessation induction approach for those who would not otherwise
         engage with traditional services.
      </p>
      <p>Other community approaches were generally very unsuccessful, only recruiting six out
         of a targeted 30 participants. Data collected suggested this was due to three main
         reasons. First, when information was given to third parties for distribution the effectiveness
         relied on the individual’s motivation and priority for promoting the study, which
         was frequently low. Second, when the researchers took an active role in promoting
         the study in community-based locations they felt they were viewed as an ‘outsider’
         and treated with some degree of skepticism (as has been shown elsewhere 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>) and, on occasion, hostility. Third, the recruitment approach of distributing information
         in the form of flyers, posters, and public advertisements, all of which relied on
         the smoker’s motivation to directly contact the research team, was shown to be completely
         ineffective. An additional element restricting the effectiveness of the community-based
         recruitment approaches was concern over the researchers’ personal safety, which restricted
         the kinds of activity that were deemed appropriate. Our experiences mirrored those
         of public health outreach workers trying to recruit smokers into SSS to attempt abrupt
         quitting in the same location a year before the present trial.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, more research is needed about community-based recruitment approaches, although
         the indications from the present study suggest they are likely to be ineffective.
         Additional time spent with, and incentives for, community groups could be explored
         along with enrolling community ‘gatekeepers’ into the study as part of the research
         team and promoting partnership working. There is little evidence to suggest that the
         distribution of information via posters and other community media is effective; the
         possibility remains that doing so may raise the profile and increase the legitimacy
         of the research, making recruitment via other avenues more likely 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">34</span>
         </span>, although this cannot be quantified from the current research.
      </p>
      <p>It is a limitation that the present study did not seek to recruit homeless and other
         disadvantaged smokers who were not registered with a GP, as well as excluding those
         with serious mental illness (groups demonstrating high levels of smoking), but within
         the scope of the study this was necessary to ensure adequate screening during recruitment
         and safety of the research team. Smoking reduction trials may have particular appeal
         amongst such groups and future research in this area would be appropriate.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, assessing the reach of the current study (in line with the RE-AIM framework,
         used for assessing an intervention’s Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,
         and Maintenance 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">35</span>
         </span>) is problematic due to lack of any denominator figure for the eligible population
         from which the sample was derived. Ethical approval was not obtained for profiling
         those who were invited into the study but did not respond and were not successfully
         contacted by the research team. A future study should carefully consider ways to address
         this in order to more firmly establish the reach of the study in terms of accessing
         the most disadvantaged groups within society.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      </div>
      <p>This study has demonstrated that using General Practice lists is a powerful way of
         recruiting patients to health interventions in an area of deprivation, and much more
         effective than community approaches. More than 98% of people in the United Kingdom
         in all areas are registered with a GP and on average visit 5.3 times per year 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">36</span>
         </span>. People trust information provided via their GP more than other sources 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">37</span>
         </span>, and this almost certainly was the reason for the much higher response rate. It provides
         important and pragmatic information for the future recruitment of disadvantaged populations
         into research trials.
