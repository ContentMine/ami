         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Mosquito species that utilize peridomestic containers for immature development are
            commonly aggressive human biters, and because they often reach high abundance, create
            significant nuisance. One of these species, the Asian tiger mosquito 
            <i>Aedes albopictus,</i> is an important vector of emerging infectious diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya,
            and Zika fevers. Integrated mosquito management (IMM) of 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> is particularly difficult because it requires access to private yards in urban and
            suburban residences. It has become apparent that in the event of a public health concern
            due to this species, homeowners will have to be active participants in the control
            process by reducing mosquito habitats in their properties, an activity known as source
            reduction. However, limited attempts at quantifying the effect of source reduction
            by homeowners have had mixed results. Of note, many mosquito control programs in the
            US have some form of education outreach, however the primary approach is often passive
            focusing on the distribution of education materials as flyers. In 2010, we evaluated
            the use of active community peer education in a source reduction program, using AmeriCorps
            volunteers. The volunteers were mobilized over a 4-week period, in two areas with
            approximately 1,000 residences each in urban Mercer and suburban Monmouth counties
            in New Jersey, USA. The volunteers were first provided training on peridomestic mosquitoes
            and on basic approaches to reducing the number of container habitats for mosquito
            larvae in backyards. Within the two treatment areas the volunteers successfully engaged
            758 separate homes. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed a significant reduction
            in container habitats in the sites where the volunteers actively engaged the community
            compared to untreated control areas in both counties. Our results suggest that active
            education using community peer educators can be an effective means of source reduction,
            and a critical tool in the arsenal against peridomestic mosquitoes.

            mosquitoes that use peridomestic containers, and were creating nuisance concerns in
            the areas. Although our education efforts had a significant impact, it was of limited
            magnitude (&lt;20% reduction in container habitats in the educational study areas) and
            we were unable to observe a significant reduction in the numbers of containers when

            that provided verbal information about public health threats regarding mosquitoes
            and mosquito-borne diseases. This also involved active demonstrations of ways to minimize
            the occurrence of peridomestic mosquitoes. We employed a door-to-door campaign, where
            a large proportion of the community was actively involved in the educational process.
            We also included additional community events to help increase source reduction efforts.

               at each surveyed home. Survey teams would walk the entire property (front, back, and
               side yards) inspecting all potential container habitats. Containers were defined as
               anything natural or manmade whose shape and structure allows it to collect and hold
               water for 2 or more days. We also included a category called “managed containers”
               (a container that has been deliberately turned upside down, covered, chlorinated,
               aerated, or maintained in a way that would prevent the collection of water or the
               production of mosquitoes). An “unmanaged container” was any container that fit the
               definition of “container” above, and was not being “managed” as described above. Since
               we were simply looking at behavior change (measured by reduction of habitats), we
               did not identify larvae or pupae to species. At each home, a spread sheet was used
               to record the address, date, time of survey, container type, number of containers,
               number of water-filled containers, and those infested with larvae and/or pupae. All
               containers, larvae, and pupae were left undisturbed during the container surveys,
               as not to affect future survey results. We did not collect samples or identify the
               larvae or pupae to species. In Monmouth County, approximately 50 homes each were selected
               in the treatment and control sites. In Mercer County, approximately 75 homes each
               were selected in the treatment and control sites. Homes were selected using Geographic
               Information System (GIS) technology, using grids to separate out the treatment and
               control areas into 50 (Monmouth) or 75 (Mercer) zones. The home closest to the center
               of each grid, when permission was granted, was selected as our survey location. Due

               risk using these indices. The number of positive (contains larvae and/or pupae) and
               negative containers per treatment area were compared using Chi Square analysis (SPSS).
               We performed a spatial analysis, where total number of unmanaged containers for each
               sampled residence were plotted using ArcMAP GIS (North American Datum 1983). For each
               site and month, maps were created using inverse distance weighted (IDW) mapping tools.
               The parameters for the IDW included using a variable search radius, references the
               12 closest points, and weighting those points closest heavier than those further away
               (IDW squared). The color reference scales for map interpolations were standardized
               to the same scale, and compared by looking at overall trends in the dataset. These
               interpolations allowed us to ascertain if the numbers of containers per home were
               uniformly distributed or were influenced by homes with large numbers of containers
               per yard. We calculated the difference between pre-educational survey interpolations
               and interpolations of surveys immediately following education using ArcMAP’s spatial
               analyst math tools. This analysis allowed us to examine the overall change in behavior
               spatially (positive or negative) regardless of the variation in the number of containers
               per home. Difference maps were color coded either black (increase in containers) or
               grey (decrease or no change in containers). The resulting image was analyzed in ImageJ
               by calculating out the total black and grey geometric areas within each image. A chi
               square analysis of the resulting geometric area was performed to assess whether observed
               behavioral changes between residents pre-education and immediately following education
               were independent of educational events within the community.

               presentation, and advertisements for free consultations (for those individuals who
               were not home during the education). A total of 97 tires were picked up from the front
               curbs of 12 homes during the tire pick up days. The number of tires per curb (mean = 8.8)
               ranged from 1 to 22 tires. Of the 12 homes participating in the tire pick up days,
               tires were received from homes that were actively educated (50%), informed from a

            faced with implementing an emergency response to mosquitoes and mosquito-borne disease
            epidemics. The use of volunteers during these emergencies can help facilitate the

            the sites not receiving education (control sites). Interestingly, trends in container
            abundance were similar for both counties. Prior to this study, we had evaluated passive

            our previous study in 2009, we observed a willingness to help empty standing water
            on their property, when we had an interaction with the homeowner. In addition, we
            felt the presence of mosquito personnel counting containers could have indirectly
            motivated residents to conduct source reduction

            from our community peer educators. Tires are an important mosquito habitat for 
            <i>Ae. albopictus,</i> and comprise a large percentage of the container habitats in our study areas

            percent increase in container habitats in the education sites over the entire season
            (5.6%) was far less of that in the control sites (52.1%). In addition, the increase
            in container habitats needs to be assessed in the context of the entire season. In
            the warm and humid summers in New Jersey, the number of water-filled containers increases
            over the summer as residents spend more time outdoors and rain events fill them with
            water. This increase is readily exploited by 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> females that maximize their offspring’s fitness by spreading their eggs across many

            could have reduced availability of habitat for container mosquitoes. In Mercer county,
            very few containers (1.7% of all sampled) contained water during the final survey.
            This was very different to what was seen in Monmouth County, where 30.4% of all sampled
            containers in the final survey contained water. Therefore, the two counties should
            be evaluated independently when considering larval indices.

            homeowners by having one of the co-authors visit a property as it was visited by one
            of the teams. Each day, a different team was evaluated to assess their quality. We
            found all teams were always polite and did an excellent job in pointing out things
            homeowners were doing correctly. However, since the volunteers were not mosquito biologists
            or control experts, there were occasional instances where a fully or partially inconspicuous
            container habitat would go unnoticed. The quality of education may have therefore
            varied from team to team and throughout the study. However, our expectation is that
            once a homeowner becomes educated regarding mosquito habitats, they can sustain source
            reduction efforts by continually finding sources of habitats on their own property.
            This is essential, since source reduction efforts done solely by mosquito control
            personnel, in the absence of sustained effort, can result in the repopulation of key
