            <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, a mosquito native to Asia, has invaded all five continents during the past three
            decades. It was reported in central Africa in the 2000s, first in Cameroon, and, since
            then, has colonised almost all countries of the region. The species, originally considered
            a secondary vector of dengue viruses, has been showed to play a major role in transmission
            of chikungunya virus in numerous countries, including in the central African region.
            We review the current spread of 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> in central Africa, its larval ecology and its impact on indigenous species such as
            
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. We explore the potential of 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> to affect the epidemiology of emerging or re-emerging arboviruses and discuss the
            conventional means for its control, while emphasizing the importance of data on its
            susceptibility to insecticides to cope with potential outbreaks.

            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> is considered to be a vector or potential vector of several pathogens of human and
            veterinary importance. Viral isolation and vector competence studies have shown that
            this mosquito is an efficient vector of more than 20 arboviruses [

            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> was first identified in South Africa in 1989, probably due to trade in used tyres
            from Japan, and it was promptly controlled [

                  <a href="#CR7">7</a>

            </span>] and has since been found in almost all countries of the region. 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> is often found with resident species in the same city and larval breeding sites,
            particularly with

            vector 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i>. In this paper, we report the current understanding of the biology, behaviour and

               <i>Ae. albopictus</i> is present only in the southern part of the country, which is characterized by an
               equatorial climate, whereas the native species

               6°N latitude), where 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> is found alone. High densities of

               interactions between the invasive species 
               <i>Ae. albopictus</i> and the resident species 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. Data obtained showed that immature stages of both species colonized a variety of
               artificial natural breeding sites and were often found together at the same larval
               development sites. 
               <i>Ae. albopictus</i>, however, colonizes preferentially containers containing plant debris or surrounded
               by vegetation. Thus, although the two vectors are sympatric, significant differences
               in their relative proportions and their spatial distribution are likely, due to environmental
               factors (e.g. climate, vegetation and building density). In the detailed study in
               Bangui (CAR), 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> species represented the majority in the early rainy season, whereas 
               <i>Ae. albopictus</i> was most abundant in the late rainy season. This is probably due to the better tolerance
               of 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> eggs to desiccation than those of

               In CAR, where a high infestation index of 
               <i>Ae. albopictus</i> has been reported, there is thus an imminent risk for large outbreaks of arboviral
               infections, such as dengue, chikungunya and zika, as observed elsewhere in the region.

            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> in central Africa, its larval ecology and its impact on the resident species, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, and have explored the possible implication of 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> in emerging or re-emerging arbovirus diseases. Various studies conducted in the region
            indicate that establishment and expansion of 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> populations were facilitated by its ecological plasticity and by its ability to outcompete
            the indigenous species 
            <i>Ae. aegypti. Ae. albopictus</i> thus found an environment similar to its native one, suggesting competition between
            this and native species. This invasive species is an efficient epidemic viral vector
            rather than a simple pest. The fact that central Africa has many potentially suitable
            niches for 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i>, as described in this review, and the presence of several endemic arboviruses of
            medical and veterinary importance could increase the risk for transmission of arboviruses
            such as DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV in central Africa. We have therefore reported measures
            for assessing the risk for mosquito-borne diseases and for preparing to control disease
            outbreaks.
