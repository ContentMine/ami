Here we examine the potential of empty AAV2 particles (AAVLPs), assembled from VP3 alone, for display of L2 epitopes to enhance their immunogenicity. Insertion of a neutralizing epitope (amino acids 17&#x02013;36) from L2 of HPV16 and HPV31 into VP3 at positions 587 and 453, respectively, permitted assembly into empty AAV particles (AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)). Intramuscularly vaccination of mice and rabbits with AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)s in montanide adjuvant, induced high titers of HPV16 L2 antibodies as measured by ELISA. Sera obtained from animals vaccinated with the AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)s neutralized infections with several HPV types in a pseudovirion infection assay. Lyophilized AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) particles retained their immunogenicity upon reconstitution. Interestingly, vaccination of animals that were pre-immunized with AAV2 - simulating the high prevalence of AAV2 antibodies in the population - even increased cross neutralization against HPV31, 45 and 58 types. Finally, passive transfer of rabbit antisera directed against AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)s protected na&#x000ef;ve mice from vaginal challenge with HPV16 pseudovirions. In conclusion, AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) particles have the potential as a broadly protective vaccine candidate regardless of prior exposure to AAV.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been linked to the development of cervical cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-ZurHausen1">[1]</xref>. Attempts to prevent infection with the most prevalent high risk HPV types &#x02013; HPV16 and HPV18 &#x02013; led to the development of two highly efficacious HPV vaccines that comprise virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled from the major capsid protein L1. However these vaccines target only two of the 15 high-risk HPV types, responsible for 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; of cervical cancer cases. The prevention of 96&#x00025; of cervical cancer would require the immunity against at least 7 high-risk HPV types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58), but this increases the cost and complexity of manufacture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Munoz1">[2]</xref>.

AAV particles that are very stable over a wide range of pH and temperature have a diameter of 25 nm, and are composed of 60 capsid protein subunits, designated VP1, VP2, and VP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Xie1">[12]</xref>. A recent study demonstrated that assembly of AAV capsids requires the expression of a virally encoded assembly-activating protein (AAP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Sonntag1">[13]</xref>. Moreover, co-expression of VP3 with AAP allows the efficient production of virus-like particles (AAVLPs) composed of only the major capsid protein VP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Sonntag1">[13]</xref>. These capsids adopt an identical external capsid structure as VP1, VP2 and VP3 containing capsids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Sonntag2">[14]</xref> and represent a preferred scaffold for peptide vaccination, because of their simplicity and their inability to transfer genes which may inadvertently have been packaged in such AAVLPs. Due to the highly structured and repetitive presentation of epitopes on the capsid (60 times), combined with the intrinsic immunogenicity of AAV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Boutin1">[15]</xref>, potent B-cell responses against the peptide presented at immunogenic capsid positions can be expected. So far, AAV capsids have not been analyzed for this purpose.</p><p>Here we show for the first time the potential to present B-cell epitopes on AAVLP capsid surface. We generated AAVLPs displaying HPV16 L2 epitopes in position 587 and HPV31 L2 epitopes in position 453.

These observations suggest that recombinant AAVLPs could be generated with insertions of peptides in positions 587 and 453. After immunization with HPV16 L2 peptide 17&#x02013;36 a broad range of cross- neutralizing antibodies was generated, but low or no antibodies against HPV31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Gambhira1">[23]</xref>. Since HPV L2 17&#x02013;36 aa sequences of HPV16 and 31 are clearly different, we incorporated both HPV L2 peptides into AAVLP particles at position 587 and 453 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g001">figure 1A</xref>). Stretches of 3 or 5 glycine residues were added to the N and C termini of the respective peptides for optimal surface display and several amino acids resulting from restriction enzyme sites used for cloning increased the size of inserted peptide sequences to 35 aa (position 453) and 31 aa (position 587). The amino acids at positions 585 and 588 were substituted. These R585A/R588A substitutions increased the titers of AAVLP particles with inserts. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of AAVLPs confirmed the identity and size (approximately 66 kDa of AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) VP3) of the purified protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g001">figure 1B</xref>). Presentation of the inserted HPV L2 peptides on the AAVLP particles were demonstrated with L2-specific rabbit sera in a dot blot assay under native conditions.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g003">figure 3A</xref>, the enhancing effect of the adjuvant was also evident from the neutralizing activity against HPV16 and HPV31, but the HPV31-specific neutralization was weaker. Future HPV vaccines should induce immunity against other high-risk HPV types. We therefore analysed the ability of our particles to induce cross-neutralizing antibodies against several PsV (HPV18, HPV45, HPV52 and HPV58). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g003">figure 3B</xref> a similar pattern of reactivity was observed when the sera were tested for cross-neutralizing antibodies against HPV18, HPV45, HPV52 and HPV58.

We conclude from these results that neutralizing activity against HPV16 induced by the particles is higher than the one to HPV31. Cross-neutralization can only be achieved with adjuvanted AAVLPs.

Intervention with this infection pathway by prophylactic vaccination has two possible targets, the L1 or the L2 protein of the HPV capsid. While L1 antibodies are able to prevent both steps &#x02013; attachment to basal membrane and to keratinocytes &#x02013; L2 antibodies can interfere only with binding to the keratinocytes. L1 antibodies can be induced to high neutralization titers, especially when generated by HPV-VLPs, however, they have the drawback of HPV-type restriction. Furthermore, L1 VLPs are expensive to produce, especially for highly multivalent vaccines, and distribution of such vaccines requires a cold chain which limits their adoption by developing countries. Thus, although two approved L1 HPV-VLP vaccines &#x02013; Gardasil&#x02122; and Cervarix&#x02122; &#x02013; are highly protective against the main high-risk HPV infections, they lack cross-protection against other, more rare high-risk HPV types, they are not heat stable and are expensive to produce. L2 vaccines on the other hand, are able to expand the cross-protection profile due to extensive homology of the N terminus of L2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Gambhira2">[30]</xref>. In particular, oligopeptides of the L2 proteins are sufficient to induce a broadly cross-neutralizing immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Pastrana1">[31]</xref>. However, neutralizing titers generated by L2 peptides are relatively low compared to those produced by L1VLPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Roden2">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Several attempts have been made to improve the immunogenicity of L2. These include insertion of L2-neutralizing epitopes on the surface of HPV VLPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Schellenbacher1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Slupetzky1">[33]</xref>, construction of tandem repeats of one peptide on bacterial thioredoxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Rubio1">[3]</xref> or concatenated L2 peptides from different papillomavirus types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Jagu1">[11]</xref>. We have chosen AAVLPs as a platform for presentation of a cross-neutralizing L2 epitope (aa 17&#x02013;36). AAV capsids tolerate insertion of peptides at different positions of the capsid and can be produced in large quantities from only one capsid protein making it a simple, non-infectious, empty capsid vaccine molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Sonntag1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Muzyczka1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Michelfelder1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Mitchell1">[20]</xref>. In this first exploration of AAVLPs as a vaccine for generating a humoral immune response, the anti-peptide titers obtained were remarkably high (in the range of 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup>) after two immunizations with only 0.6 &#x000b5;g VLPs per dose. A third immunization only slightly increased the anti-L2 peptide titers. Nevertheless, an adjuvant seems to be required for AAVLP vaccination, because the recombinant AAV capsid alone elicits only a weak or no innate immune response. So far, only one alternative adjuvant (MPL) has been tested which was not as effective as montanide. Other options have still to be explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-McKee1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Guy1">[35]</xref>. Pre-existence of anti AAV antibodies which are highly prevalent in the human populations, rather boosts than prevents the generation of the L2 specific immune response. This could be explained by improved, anti-AAV antibody Fc-mediated uptake of AAVLPs by professional antibody presenting cells. A particular advantage of AAVLPs is their stability which allows lyophilization and rehydration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Kuck1">[36]</xref>. Thus, lyophilization of AAVLPs likely permits storage and delivery of AAVLPs under harsh conditions and in principle circumvents the need of a cold chain for vaccine distribution. This may be an important cost factor in developing countries and should be further explored.</p><p>The AAVLPs of this study can be produced by transient transfection of one or two plasmids expressing the capsid protein VP3 and the assembly activating protein AAP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Sonntag1">[13]</xref>. Under these conditions production of 10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>13</sup> capsids/ml can be achieved. Purification of the particles follows standard chromatography procedures and does not constitute a bottle-neck for AAVLP manufacturing. Co-expression of VP3 and AAP using baculovirus based vectors in insect cells provides one possibility of scale-up for clinical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Aucoin1">[37]</xref>, our own results). Methods for less costly AAVLP production, e.g. using bacteria or yeast, have still to be explored.</p><p>Immunization with AAVLPs containing the insertion of two different L2 peptide sequences at two separate positions of the same capsid provided a broadly cross-neutralizing antiserum, as tested in a pseudovirion (PsV) infection assay. This was observed in C57BL/6 mice, Balb/c mice and in rabbits. The HPV16-L2 peptide inserted at 587 provided nearly 100&#x00025; protection against HPV16 PsV infection with rather high neutralizing antibody titers. This was not the case for the HPV31-L2 peptide inserted at aa position 453 and tested in the HPV31 PsV-based neutralization assay. The result is in agreement with the study of Jagu et al. that showed that a multitype L2 fusion protein which included a peptide of HPV31 induced robust antibody titers against various HPV types, but had relatively low titers against HPV31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Jagu1">[11]</xref>. However, also the position of peptide insertion in the AAV capsid may play a role. Peptides at position 453 are more exposed on the AAV capsid surface and have a larger interpeptide distance at the threefold symmetry axis of AAV2 than peptides inserted at aa 587. Immunization with the same peptides inserted at the reversed positions should show whether the inherent immunogenicity of the two peptides or the localization on the capsid surface is responsible for the difference in the immune reaction. Such an analysis might provide valuable information for the optimal spatial arrangement of antigenic epitopes on viral scaffolds for vaccination.</p><p>Because vaccination at low dose applies only 0.6 &#x000b5;g of AAVLPs/dose, a number of combinations of different AAVLPs can be tested for optimization of the vaccine. This includes also combinations of different AAVLPs with insertions of different HPV-L2 peptides at one position or combined at two positions. Another option would be the insertion of L2 peptides into other immunogenic sites of the AAV capsid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Bartel1">[38]</xref>. Furthermore, the combination of peptide insertions with the expression of antigens by gene transfer may provide a basis for a combined prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine.</p><p>Cross-neutralizing vaccines against HPV types may not only be prophylactic for cervical cancer and genital warts, but may also have an impact on the prevention of a subset of head and neck or skin cancers for which a causal role of certain HPV types has been described.

Each 2 &#x000b5;l of the serially diluted sera were transferred to 21 white 384 well cell culture plates (PerkinElmer) with an EP3 384-head pipetting robot (Perkin Elmer), the plates immediately sealed with a polypropylene cover foil and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="s4n"><title>In Vivo Pseudovirus Delivery and Infection</title><p>HPV16 pseudovirions with encapsulated luciferase reporter were generated by cotransfection of 293TT cells with plasmids encoding codon-modified L1 and L2 and a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Pastrana2">[40]</xref>. Female Balb/c mice were treated with 3 mg of Depo-provera (Pfizer) 4 days prior to viral challenge. One day prior to challenge, mice were injected i.p. with buffer, undiluted rabbit antisera or 20 &#x000b5;g of purified RG-1 monoclonal antibody. The mice were anesthetized and challenged with pseudovirus as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Roberts1">[42]</xref>, but with modifications. Briefly, a HPV16 PsV inoculum of 20 &#x000b5;l mixed with 20 &#x000b5;l of a 3&#x00025; CMC preparation, based on L1 content, was used. The inoculum was delivered using an M20 positive-displacement pipette in two doses; 20 &#x000b5;l before and 20 &#x000b5;l after insertion in the vagina of a Cytobrush that was turned clockwise and counterclockwise 10 times. After the challenge, standard dissecting forceps were used to occlude the vaginal introitus to achieve maximal retention of the material while the mice recover from anesthesia. Three days after pseudovirion challenge, the mice were again anesthetized and 20 &#x000b5;l of luciferin (7.8 mg/ml) was deposited in the vaginal vault. Luciferase signals were acquired for 10 min with a Xenogen IVIS 100 imager, and analysis was performed with Living Image 2.0 software (Caliper Life Sciences). An identical region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the luciferase signal emitted from each mouse, and the average radiance within the ROI was determined.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We want to thank Prof. Dr. Gerhard Wanner of the faculty of biology at the LMU in Munich, Germany for making the electron microscopic pictures.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have read the journal&#x02019;s policy and have the following conflicts: MW, MR, SS, MK, MH and UM are or were employees of MediGene AG when the study was performed.
