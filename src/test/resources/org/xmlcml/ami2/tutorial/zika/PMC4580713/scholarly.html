         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The purpose of this study was to examine whether meaning in life understood in terms
            of presence, search, and personal meaning is a mediator in the relationships between
            religious coping and psychological well-being. Associations of religiousness and psychological
            well-being are complex and suggest the existence of meaning and purpose in their internal
            structures. Two studies were conducted. In Study 1, presence of meaning in life was
            a mediator between negative coping and psychological well-being in the scope of a
            total score and all its dimensions. Search for meaning in life did not mediate the
            above relations. In Study 2, personal meaning turned out to be a partial mediator
            between negative coping and psychological well-being. These findings suggest that
            meaning in life is a crucial element of religious coping and psychological well-being
            that is used by people as a part of their meaning system to cope with life’s difficulties
            and challenges.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">One of the factors that affect human functioning is meaning in life. Many psychologists

               goals, and categorize important objects. Despite widespread agreement regarding the
               importance of meaning in life, defining it poses a challenge from both a theoretical
               and empirical point of view. Frankl (

               aim for their lives and tries to actualize as many values as possible in their community.

               researchers describe meaning in life in terms of significance (Yalom

               and comprehensible information.

               or see significance in their lives, accompanied by the degree to which they perceive
               themselves to have purpose, mission, or overarching aim in life” (p. 682). This definition
               is broad enough to encompass a wide range of human experiences related to purpose
               and significance and also suggests that people can find meaning by engaging in creative
               endeavours and pursuing their goals. Steger (

               </span>) points out that meaning is a superordinate term that encompasses two main factors:
               comprehension and purpose. The first factor reflects the human ability to make sense
               of and understand one’s life, including one’s self, the external world, and how one
               fits with and operates within the world. The second factor denotes overarching and
               long-term life aspirations that are self-concordant and stimulate related activity.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">According to Steger et al. (

                  </sup>
               </span>), people’s approach to understanding meaning in life can be viewed in two principal
               dimensions: presence of meaning in life and search for meaning in life. The former
               concerns the degree to which individuals perceive their lives as significant and meaningful.
               The latter reflects the degree to which people are engaged in a search for meaning
               in life. Both dimensions have an essentially different character and express dissimilar
               attitudes to life. Presence of meaning in life allows people to experience their lives
               as comprehensible and significant and feel a sense of purpose or mission in their
               lives that transcends the mundane concerns of daily life (Steger

                  </sup>
               </span>). Search for meaning in life relates to the dynamic and active efforts individuals
               expend when they try to comprehend the meaning, significance, and purpose of their
               lives (Steger et al.

               constructed cognitive system, which endows life with personal significance. It can
               be conceived as a dynamic, cognitive map that directs people through their life course.

               motivational, cognitive, relational, and personal. The categories are used to assess
               both self and life events in regard to meaning (McDonald et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">

                  </sup>
               </span>). Personal meaning measures implicit meaning (i.e. conceptions and beliefs regarding
               life held by people) which is viewed as “comprising an ideally meaningful life”. It
               assesses the level of meaning in seven domains: achievement (pursuit and attainment
               of significant life goals), relationship (general social adeptness), religion (having
               affirmative beliefs about relationships with the divine), self-transcendence (engagement
               in selfless pursuits), self-acceptance (a humble acceptance of one’s limitations),
               intimacy (having emotionally close relationships), and fair treatment (perceiving
               a degree of justice in life).

               (Pargament 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">

               </span>, p. 32). Despite the fact that the relationship between religion and meaning is intimate
               and complex, many people find in religious beliefs a sense of purpose, understanding,
               and psychological support (Park

               </span>). In their seminal book 
               <i>“</i>The psychology of religion. An empirical approach”, Hood et al. (

               are that the search for meaning is of central importance to human functioning, and
               that religion is uniquely capable of helping in that search” (p. 12). Religious systems
               provide individuals with an integrated set of beliefs, goals, and meanings which can
               be used in explaining intricacies of the world and dealing with personal situations
               and problems.

               </span>) emphasize four criteria by which religion is uniquely capable of providing global
               meaning: comprehensiveness, accessibility, transcendence, and direct claims. First,
               religion is the most comprehensive of all meaning systems, because it includes an
               extensive range of other sources of meaning, such as social relationships, work, family,
               achievement, personal relationships, and important values. Religion is accessible
               to people in the sense of contributing to global meaning through promoting doctrinal
               teachings and creeds, religious education, and ethical norms of acceptable and unacceptable
               behaviours. The next criterion: transcendence reflects people’s tendency to search
               for an invisible reality and explore “ultimate concerns” (Emmons 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">
                  <sup>
                     <a href="#CR13">2005</a>
                  </sup>
               </span>) which requires some belief in an ultimate authority in which higher meaning is found.
               Finally, religion makes direct claims to provide a sense of significance as it facilitates
               people’s efforts to interpret their experiences in terms of existential intentions
               and meaning which is embedded within religion’s sacred character.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The ability of religion to provide meaning in life is particularly noticeable in the
               context of coping with stress and major life events. Religious coping can be defined
               in terms of “the degree to which religion is a part of the process of understanding
               and dealing with critical life events” (Pargament et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">

               </span>) who introduced the concept of religious coping reveal that it can be helpful or
               harmful, depending upon the particular type of religious coping strategy employed.
               In general, religious coping methods can be grouped into two wide overarching categories:
               positive and negative religious coping (Pargament et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">

                  </sup>
               </span>). Positive religious coping styles relate to secure relationships with God and a
               sense of spiritual connectedness with others. They tend to be more beneficial for
               people who experience stressful events. Negative religious coping styles reveal insecure
               relationships with God and strains between individuals, and as research indicates,
               they are usually maladaptive (Ano and Vasconcelles

               by making meaning after the loss of a loved one. In the initial period of mourning,
               people who had strong religious beliefs tended to experience more stress, which was
               linked to the discrepancy between their global meaning system and appraisals of such
               events. However, after a period of a few months, these effects disappeared or even
               reversed, suggesting a positive association between religion and long-term adjustment.
               Drawing on religion as a meaning system, studies show that individuals can derive
               comprehensive frameworks of personal meaning from their religious beliefs which in

               (PIL), and (6) personal growth. Taken together, they offer a multidimensional, eudaimonic

               and self-esteem. In addition, meaning in life turned out to be an important mediator
               of the relation between daily religious activity and well-being, which can suggest
               that religious individuals might feel greater well-being because they derive meaning
               in life from their religious feelings and activities. Krok (

               system and PWB. However, research has not been conducted that would investigate relations
               between religious coping and PWB which could reveal more precisely the nature and
               mechanisms relating religion to well-being.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The evidence from the above studies indicates that in the context of other potential
               mediators between religiousness and well-being, meaning in life appears very promising.
               Yet, examination of measures of meaning in life reveals that these scales often refer
               to diverse dimensions and are based on different premises. Some of them assume that
               daily life itself may be assessed with regard to meaning [e.g. the PIL, Crumbaugh

               </span>], while others evaluate meaning in life in terms of both presence and search (Steger

                  </sup>
               </span>). Thus, meaning in life is not simply a one-dimensional, global judgment made about
               a life as a whole but a construct that encompasses more dimensions. It needs to be
               examined from different perspectives if we want to discover the complexities of meaningful
               life and find variables associated with daily meaning in life.

            <h3>Overview of Studies</h3>
            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In the present study, we decided to examine meaning in life as a factor that can explain
               the relation between religious coping and PWB. First, we wanted to investigate more
               deeply relationships between religious coping and PWB which expand our knowledge about
               the ways in which people rely on their religious beliefs and activities in building
               existential life satisfaction and forming a global judgment of a well-lived life.
               People use their religion in order to discover the deeper truths and mysteries in
               life and to understand what makes their life valuable. Second, because meaning in
               life was analysed in the perspectives of both presence and search (Study 1), and personal
               meaning (Study 2), it allows us to investigate its different dimensions and their
               mediational effects between religious coping and PWB. Meaning in life is often portrayed
               as emerging out of motivation. Therefore, the question of whether its dimensions play
               a role in mediating relations between the forms of coping based on religious experiences
               and well-being ingrained in existential challenges of life appears very important.
               Finally, we wanted to assess which dimensions of meaning in life are most associated
               with PWB. It is very likely that when individuals have a view of life as personally
               significant and purposeful, they ought to experience their life as valued and self-fulfilled.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In Study 1, we examined how positive and negative religious coping related to meaning
            in life and PWB. Then, we used multiple regression and mediational tests to assess
            the degree to which presence of and search for meaning in life mediated the relation
            between the two ways of religious coping and PWB. We used PWB as an outcome measure
            because it has received considerable research attention and occupies a prominent place
            in theories of eudaimonic well-being (Ong and Zautra

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The study focused on the following hypotheses: (1) endorsement of religious coping
            styles will be differently correlated with individuals’ meaning in life. That is,
            positive coping will show positive associations with meaning in life, whereas negative
            coping will correlate negatively with meaning in life; (2) there will be associations
            between religious coping and PWB; (3) presence of meaning in life will be a stronger
            mediator between religious coping and PWB than search for meaning in life.

                  solving, religious forgiveness, and benevolent religious appraisals of illness; and

                  powers. People indicate how often they engage in each form of religious coping on

                  </sup>
               </span>). There was no significant association between positive coping and the total score
               of PWB which invalidates further statistical analyses. However, negative coping was
               negatively related to PWB which satisfies the first requirement (
               <i>β</i> = −.42; 
               <i>p</i> &lt; .001). Fulfilling the second requirement, negative coping was also related to presence
               of meaning (

               <i>p</i> &lt; .01). Satisfying the third requirement, presence was related to PWB, controlling
               for negative coping (
               <i>β</i> = .39; 
               <i>p</i> &lt; .001). The next requirement was that the relation between negative coping and PWB
               be significantly smaller, with presence entered as a predictor. However, the relation
               between negative coping and PWB decreased (from −.42 to −.32), although it remained
               significant. The Sobel test was significant (
               <i>z</i> = −4.30; 
               <i>p</i> &lt; .001). Presence of meaning seemed thus to be a partial mediator of the relation
               between negative coping and PWB.

               life as a mediator, because there was no significant association between negative
               coping and search (

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In summary, the results obtained in Study 1 indicate that religious coping is associated
               with meaning in life. Positive coping positively correlated with both dimensions of
               meaning in life: presence and search, whereas negative coping was only negatively
               linked with presence. The results confirmed the first hypothesis showing that religiousness
               understood in terms of coping styles relates to a sense of purpose and significance.
               Only negative coping was related negatively to PWB in the scope of the total score
               and all the dimensions: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive
               relations with others, PIL, and self-acceptance. It allows us to partially verify
               the second hypothesis indicating associations between religious coping and PWB. The
               associations only occur in the negative forms of religious coping. The main result
               of Study 1 was revealing presence of meaning in life as a mediator between negative
               coping and PWB in the scope of a total score and all its dimensions. However, meaning
               only partially mediated the above relation which suggests that people’s expectations
               for significance and purpose in the future cannot be explained completely by religion’s
               contribution to their meaning in life. This view was supported by the fact that search
               for meaning in life did not mediate the relation between religious coping and PWB.
               The third hypothesis was thus partially confirmed.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The results provide support for the mediational role of presence of meaning in life
               in the relation between religious coping and PWB. Yet, one limitation of this study
               was that the measure of presence of meaning in life was assessed in only one dimension.
               Therefore, using a more refined measure of presence appears reasonable and fully justified.
               In Study 2, we sought to continue to examine the relations between religious coping
               and PWB by using a multidimensional measure of meaning in life which also has a slightly
               different character.

            religious coping and PWB by including personal meaning that is based on an implicit
            theories approach and regarded as “comprising an ideally meaningful life” (Wong

            self-transcendence, self-acceptance, intimacy, and fair treatment. Consistent with
            the meaning-as-mediator model, we hypothesized that personal meaning would mediate
            the relation between religious coping and PWB.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Positive correlations were found between positive coping and personal meaning and
               its dimensions: achievement, relationship, religion, self-transcendence, self-acceptance,
               intimacy, and fair treatment. On the contrary, negative coping was negatively associated
               with personal meaning and all its dimensions except religion. The last result was
               rather surprising if we take into account opposite directions between positive and
               negative coping. PWB positively correlated with personal meaning and all its dimensions.

               meaning and PWB as most relationships turned out to be statistically significant.
               The only associations which were insignificant occurred between relationship and autonomy,
               religion and both autonomy and environmental mastery, fair treatment and autonomy.

               personal meaning (total score) mediated the relation between religious coping and
               PWB. To assess whether the conditions for mediation were met, we separately assessed
               each necessary relation (Baron and Kenny

               </span>). No significant association was found between positive coping and the total score
               of PWB (
               <i>β</i> = .08; 
               <i>p</i> &lt; .26) which does not allow further statistical analyses.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">However, negative coping was negatively related to PWB which meets the first requirement
               (

               meaning (
               <i>β</i> = −.24; 
               <i>p</i> &lt; .001). According to the third requirement, personal meaning was related to PWB,
               controlling for negative coping (
               <i>β</i> = .46; 
               <i>p</i> &lt; .001). Regarding the fourth requirement of mediation, negative coping was still
               significantly related to PWB (
               <i>β</i> = −.31; 
               <i>p</i> &lt; .001) when personal meaning was added to the model. The relation between negative
               coping and PWB decreased (from −.41 to −.31), although it remained significant. Next,
               a Sobel test was performed to determine whether personal meaning partially mediated
               the relation between negative coping and PWB. The Sobel test was significant (
               <i>z</i> = −2.95; 
               <i>p</i> &lt; .003), indicating that personal meaning is a partial mediator accounting for at
               least a portion of the relation between negative coping and PWB.

               achievement, relationship, self-transcendence, self-acceptance, intimacy, and fair
               treatment met the statistical requirements (regressions and a Sobel test) for mediation
               and were partial mediators in the relations between negative coping and PWB. Religion
               was the only factor that did not satisfy mediational requirements.

               personal meaning. All the dimensions of personal meaning showed positive links with
               PWB. The mediational analyses revealed that personal meaning was a partial mediator
               between negative coping and PWB which confirms our predictions. In line with results
               from the previous study, this finding added strong support for the hypothesis that
               presence of meaning in life is an important partial mediator of the relation between
               religious coping and PWB, but only for the form of coping which is based on negative
               appraisals and accusatory attitudes towards God.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The aim of the studies was to empirically test assumptions that meaning in life may
            be a mediator in the relation between religious coping and PWB. In addition, we wanted
            to assess relationships between religious coping, meaning in life, and PWB. These
            questions were examined by using different indices of meaning in life: presence, search,
            and personal meaning which enabled us to understand more deeply how individuals form
            a meaningful life and approach a domain of significance and purpose. The results indicate
            that these relations exist which has potentially important implications.

            of the relation between negative religious coping and PWB. Several previous studies
            implied that meaning in life was a mediator between religion and well-being (Chamberlain

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR2">2003</a>

               </sup>
            </span>). The evidence from the present studies indicates that meaning in life plays a mediational
            role between a negative form of religious coping and PWB. Taken together, these results
            demonstrate that meaning in life is an important element of religion that imbues religious
            behaviour with a sense of purpose and significance. It is especially noticeable in
            the context of religious coping that is strongly connected to the domain of meaning
            (Pargament et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">

               </sup>
            </span>). Approaching challenging and problematic life circumstances, individuals draw on
            the orienting system of religion and meaning through which they interpret and handle
            stressful situations. Religious coping methods are used to strengthen other non-religious
            psychological resources to enable people to face life challenges.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">There are two questions that can arise in the context of the current research: why
            presence of meaning in life turned out to be a partial mediator and why only negative
            coping was related to PWB. According to recent research, meaning is a central element
            of religion because every religion addresses important questions related to a sense
            of purpose and significance (Hood et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR18">2009</a>
               </sup>
            </span>; Park 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR35">2013</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). People turn to religious beliefs and activities in order to find meaning in complex
            and incomprehensible events. Religious interpretations enable individuals to perceive
            daily experiences in terms of universal goals and provide explanations for situations
            of high ambiguity and threat. Therefore, religion is inseparably interconnected with
            meaning on both the structural and functional levels. As a result, meaning in life
            only partially mediates the relation between religious coping and PWB mainly because
            the religious realm is already imbued with meaning.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Analyses of the question why only negative religious coping was related to PWB need
            to take into account the fact that the relation had a negative character. The less
            individuals use negative coping strategies, the more their level of PWB increases.
            This result can suggest that avoidance of negative religious coping strategies such
            as punishing God appraisals, interpersonal religious discontent, or questioning God’s
            powers is beneficial for one’s PWB. When facing stressful situations, people rely
            on a system of religious beliefs, practices, and relationships which affects the ways
            in which they deal with difficult situations (Pargament 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR29">1997</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). This religious orienting system is translated into concrete situation-specific
            appraisals which are used to gain or search for a sense of significance. The process
            enables people to find meaning which, in turn, increases their PWB.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The results of this study also deepen our understanding of the function of religion
            in both human life as a whole and creating well-being. Previous studies have established
            that religion is linked to subjective well-being and that meaning in life mediates
            their relations (Chamberlain and Zika 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">

               </sup>
            </span>). The current research showed that religious coping is moderately related to PWB
            and that meaning in life is a partial mediator in the relation between both factors.
            These moderate relationships can imply that people do not primarily engage in religious
            activities to elevate subjective or PWB. Religion contributes to well-being by providing
            individuals with a sense of meaning, but the main function of religion is to bring
            people into greater contact with sacred matters, rather than maximizing happiness
            or self-fulfilment.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The findings also provide evidence that meaning in life is a crucial element of religious
            coping and PWB. People use religious beliefs, feelings, and practices as a part of
            their meaning system to cope with life’s difficulties and challenges (Pargament et
            al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). The links existing between religious coping and meaning in life suggest that religion
            can influence many aspects of meaning by providing an ultimate motivation to all aspects
            of a person’s life, establishing goals and value systems and helping to instil a deeper
            sense of meaning in life. It is unquestionably evident within a framework of the meaning
            making model proposed by Park (

            the meaning system of many individuals.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Meaning in life appears instrumental in creating PWB. It mainly refers to the dimensions
            of presence and personal meaning, but not search which did not have any associations
            with PWB apart from its two dimensions: personal growth and positive relations with
            others. The results imply that existential convictions regarding a sense of significance
            and purpose help individuals to attain higher levels of PWB in the domain of autonomy,
            environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, and self-acceptance.
            They also appear to reflect a noticeably human characteristic of striving for meaning
            in life as a way of increasing the form of well-being that is based on values and
            engaged with existential challenges of life. People struggle to explore important
            areas of their life through personal goal systems and PIL.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The present study certainly has limitations which warrant discussion. First, religiousness
            was only assessed in terms of religious coping which is the degree to which religion
            is helpful in understanding and dealing with critical life events. Replication of
            the current results with other measures of religiousness would reveal the associations
            of other domains of religion (e.g. specific religious beliefs, emotions, or activities)
            with PWB and broaden our understanding of which factors are most important in those
            relations. Second, the current work relied wholly on self-report measures of meaning
            in life. Although it has been the most popular method of measuring this factor, it
            does not tap the full range of individual differences regarding a sense of purpose
            and significance (Reker 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR37">2005</a>

            </span>; Steger

               <sup>

            </span>). Future research could employ experimental procedures of assessing meaning in life.
            Procedures consisting in inducing thoughts or feelings related to the domain of meaning
            would enable researchers to formulate more precise causal relations and understand
            how meaning can change under the influence of various factors. Thirdly, the assessment
            was done once at a given time which limits chances of investigating potential changes
            in meaning in life. Introducing longitudinal methods of evaluations e.g. asking participants
            to keep a diary of meaningful events for a longer time (i.e. a month or even more)
            would more precisely divulge the process by which meaning is created from life experiences.
            A final limitation of the present study is that the samples were mainly composed of
            Christians. It was a consequence of the specific character of the examined population
            (Poland) in which a vast majority of the people are Christians. Hence, the findings
            may not generalize to other populations which include other religions.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Despite its limitations, the current study provides evident support for the hypotheses
            that meaning in life is a partial mediator through which religious coping is associated
            with PWB and that presence of meaning in life is strongly linked with well-being based
            on a eudaimonic approach. The programme of two studies reported here lays a strong
            foundation for further research exploring the role of meaning in life and other related
            factors in fostering well-being, as well as applying the literature on religion, meaning,
            and PWB to important human problems.
