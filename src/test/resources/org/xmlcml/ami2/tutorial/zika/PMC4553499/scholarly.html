         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Dengue is considered to be the most important mosquito-borne viral disease in the
            world. The 
            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito, its vector, is highly anthropophilic and is very well adapted to urban
            environments. Although several vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of development
            no licensed dengue vaccine is yet available. As a result, controlling the spread of
            dengue still requires that mosquitoes be targeted directly. We review the current
            methods of dengue vector control focusing on recent technical advances. We first examine
            the history of Brazil’s National Dengue Control Plan in effect since 2002, and we
            describe its establishment and operation. With the persistent recurrence of dengue
            epidemics, current strategies should be reassessed to bring to the forefront a discussion
            of the possible implementation of new technologies in Brazil’s mosquito control program.

         <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Mosquito-borne diseases are among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in
            humans. Globalization of travel and trade, unplanned urbanization and environmental
            changes have all had a significant impact on disease transmission in recent years.
            Some arboviruses, such as dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus, are emerging in
            countries where they have previously been unknown [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-insects-06-00576">

               </sup>
            </span>]. Another example of a mosquito-borne disease is the Zika fever (transmitted by a
            dengue-related flavivirus), which has not previously been thought to be an important
            human arboviral pathogen. The epidemic capacity of the Zika virus was revealed in
            an outbreak in Micronesia in 2007 and affected approximately 5000 people [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Dengue has stood out among the reemerging diseases, and it is considered to be
            the most important viral disease transmitted by arthropods. In 2013, it was estimated
            that approximately 390 million people experienced dengue virus infections per year,
            of which 96 million cases had some kind of apparent manifestation [

            </span>]. The Americas are not an exception to this trend, and the incidence of dengue in
            the Americas has increased 30-fold in the last 50 years; between 2008 and 2012, more
            than 1.2 million cases of dengue were identified each year. Furthermore, 2013 had
            the highest burden of the disease ever registered with the largest epidemic in the
            history of the Americas. A total of 2.3 million cases were reported [

            this outbreak of serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-4 was rapidly suppressed. In 1986, dengue
            acquired epidemiological importance when an epidemic broke out in the state of Rio
            de Janeiro with Serotype 1. The virus spread throughout seven states with periodic
            outbreaks until 1990 when Serotype 2 was also introduced in the Rio de Janeiro state.
            Since 1994, there has been a rapid dispersal of the vector over a large area, which
            led to a viral circulation in more states and municipalities and caused a rapid increase
            in the extent of the disease [

            fever virus through a partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Brazilian
            National Department of Public Health. Actions aimed at vector control using insecticides
            started in 1947. The advent of DDT made it possible to imagine the notion of mosquito
            eradication not only on a nationwide scale, but on a continent-wide scale. This mindset
            led to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization
            (WHO) forming a new group to fight mosquitoes: the Eradication Program of 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> in the Western Hemisphere. Thanks to these programs, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> was considered to be eradicated from Brazil by the end of the 1950s [

            control yellow fever and malaria. After 10 years, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> was reintroduced and the responsibilities of DNERu were delegated to the Superintendence
            of Public Health Campaigns (SUCAM) through the National Program of Yellow Fever and
            Dengue Control. This campaign was disbanded in 1973, and the vector was, once more,
            considered to be eradicated from the country. However, in 1976 it was reintroduced
            due to failures in epidemiological surveillance and social and environmental changes
            resulting from rapid urbanization [

            of mosquito resistance to DDT and other organochlorine insecticides, the high costs
            of materials and wages, insufficient community participation or support from the health
            sector, and an unwillingness on the part of some governments to join in simultaneous

            and disease control in 1990. Its first strategy was to develop the Eradication Plan
            of 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (PEAa). However, this plan failed because of the uncoordinated actions of each municipality
            and inconsistencies in the implementation of actions to combat the vector. FUNASA
            then gave up on eradicating the mosquito and focused instead on controlling the vector
            through the Intensification Plan of Dengue Control Actions (PIACD) in 2001. Some changes
            were enacted in 2002, and the final National Plan for Dengue Control (PNCD) was established

            to control dengue disease in the national territory. The PNCD addresses important

            sanitation activities, integrated actions of health education, communication and social

            the establishment of vector breeding sites and dengue epidemics. Moreover, climate
            change has increased the domestic practice of storing water in containers, which is
            an ideal vector-breeding site. It is therefore critical that local characteristics

            new and was originally proposed more than 20 years ago. This strategy is also known
            as paratransgenesis but only when it involves the manipulation of symbionts for the
            production of anti-pathogen effector molecules [

            <i>Wolbachia</i>, a maternally transmitted Gram-negative endosymbiotic bacterium, is a promising tool
            against diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> can be found worldwide in numerous arthropod species. More than 65% of all insect
            species are naturally infected by it due to its capacity to manipulate cellular and
            reproductive processes in invertebrates. 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> behaves more like a reproductive parasite by inducing feminization of genetic males,
            parthenogenesis, male-killing and cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Although the effects
            of 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> infection on vector reproduction are understood on some level, the exact molecular
            mechanism of cytoplasmic incompatibility remains unknown despite a substantial amount
            of research [

            <i>Wolbachia</i> strains are crossed with uninfected females (unidirectional CI) or with females carrying
            other incompatible 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> strains (bidirectional CI). The reciprocal mating of uninfected males mated with
            infected females produces viable

            <i>Wolbachia</i> infection in a given population with each subsequent generation. Uninfected males

            be performed with the simultaneous release of both males and females, population-suppression
            strategies should aim to release only males. However, both SIT and IIT require a highly
            efficient sex separation method to avoid accidental release of females, which, in
            the case of IIT, may result in population replacement of the target population; the
            females are also potential carriers of pathogens. In the absence of an adequately

            the efficiency of the control decreases rapidly when populations decline and the local
            population is not completely eliminated. In contrast, SIT becomes more efficient as
            the population decreases since insects actively seek out areas inaccessible to insecticides
            [

         <h2>5. Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">An integrated approach is the most effective strategy to overcome the constant threat
            of dengue in tropical and subtropical areas in which the existence of main vectors
            and viral circulation are an undesirable reality. To ensure effective dengue control
            measures it is necessary to maintain educational and control programs that are governmental
            priorities. Furthermore, problems such as unplanned urbanization, inadequate water
            supplies and poor sanitary conditions should be considered and addressed when looking
            for long-term interventions. Moreover, it is important to note the dengue vaccine
            development scenario since chemotherapy for this disease is not currently available.
            An ideal dengue vaccine needs to produce heterotypic immunization; in other words,
            the seroconversion needs to be efficient for all four serotypes. If not, an immunization
            may morph into an antibody-dependent enhancement after subsequent infections, a phenomenon
            inherent in dengue immunopathology [

            and TetraVax-DV dengue vaccines are in the advanced stages in Phase 3 trials, and
            the preliminary seroconversion results are encouraging but not optimal [

            licensure process, vector control is critical to disrupting the epidemiologic triad
            of dengue and other emergent/resurgent mosquito-borne viruses that 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> can also transmit. Thus, an integrated approach focusing on the mosquito vector cannot
            be disputed.

            of new vector control technologies can facilitate essential adaptations to the drastic
            epidemic scenarios occurring frequently in endemic countries. The goal of this review
            was to promote a central discussion in relation to the evolution of the national programs
            supporting dengue control using the case of Brazil as a real-life example. Brazil
            is taking the first steps to aggregate recent developed technologies such as transgenic
            mosquitoes and 
            <i>Wolbachia</i>. At the same time, the experiences made after trials or the implementation of these
            technologies in other countries can support strategy modifications as necessary in
            national programs. However, it is always critical to take into account local characteristics
            and specific problems.

            management capacities of both centralized and decentralized government programs. Prioritizing
            this view is urgent because the 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> vector has shown that it is extremely adaptable to human environments and possesses
            a high reproductive capacity and genetic flexibility, factors that fatally dismantle
            the best control programs around the world.
