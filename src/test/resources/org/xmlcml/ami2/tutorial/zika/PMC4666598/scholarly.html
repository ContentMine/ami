               diseases provides useful information regarding their prevention and control. Dengue
               fever spatio-temporal patterns result from complex interactions between the virus,
               the host, and the vector. These interactions can be influenced by environmental conditions.
               Our objectives were to analyse dengue fever spatial distribution over New Caledonia
               during epidemic years, to identify some of the main underlying factors, and to predict
               the spatial evolution of dengue fever under changing climatic conditions, at the 2100
               horizon.

               Caledonia. We then modelled and estimated the future evolution of dengue incidence
               rates using a regional downscaling of future climate projections.

               highly correlated with people's way of life. Rainfall does not seem to play an important
               role in the spatial distribution of dengue cases during epidemics. By the end of the
               21st century, if temperature increases by approximately 3°C, mean incidence rates
               during epidemics could double.

            geographical expansion during the past decades has been of growing concern for scientists
            and public health authorities because of its heavy sanitary burden and economic impacts.
            In the absence of an effective vaccine, control is currently limited to vector-control
            measures. In this context, understanding the sociologic, entomologic and environmental
            factors underlying dengue dynamics is essential and can provide public health authorities
            with sound information about control measures to be implemented. In this study, we
            analyse socio-economic, climatic and epidemiological data to understand the impact
            of the studied factors on the spatial distribution of dengue cases during epidemic
            years in New Caledonia, a French island located in the South Pacific. We identify
            at risk areas, and find that temperature and people’s way of life are key factors
            determining the level of viral circulation in New Caledonia. Hence, communication
            campaigns fostering individual protection measures against mosquito bites could help
            reduce dengue burden in New Caledonia. Using projections of temperature under different
            scenarios of climate change, we find that dengue incidence rates during epidemics
            could double by the end of the century, with areas at low risk of dengue fever being
            highly affected in the future.

            50 million people being infected each year and 2.5 billion people living in areas
            at risk of dengue worldwide [

               </sup>
            </span>]. The true burden of clinically apparent dengue could be twice as high, and the total
            burden of dengue fever infections could reach 390 million people when including asymptomatic
            cases [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004211.ref002">

            </span>]. Whereas only nine countries were affected by dengue epidemics in the 1970's, more
            than a hundred countries are now reporting dengue outbreaks on a regular basis, making
            dengue fever the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world
            [

            socio-economic changes such as global population growth and uncontrolled urbanisation.
            Lack of effective mosquito control in endemic areas, increased international air traffic
            or decay in public health infra-structure in developing countries are also important
            factors that could explain the rapid regional spread of the disease [

            these factors need to be associated with suitable climate conditions before dengue
            fever can establish, since it is transmitted by mosquito species whose life cycle
            is influenced by temperature, humidity and rainfall [

               is rare, and has been observed only once (2009). Before 2003, vector control measures
               consisted in systematic chemical control of adult mosquitoes covering large areas
               during the warm season, independently from the occurrence of dengue cases. Since 2003,
               systematic spreading of adulticide has been stopped, and vector control measures include
               continuous large communication and prevention campaigns fostering source reduction
               aimed at all citizens, as well as focal chemical control of adult mosquitoes 100 m
               around declared cases within 24 h of notification. Public Health infrastructure is
               reliable, and the surveillance system for dengue fever has been efficient for many
               years. All people have access to medical care, even though people living in remote
               areas might have more difficulties to reach local health centres.

                  were provided by Meteo France on a daily basis from 1995 to 2012 in 118 weather stations
                  scattered all over New Caledonia. We first selected data from the same time periods
                  as the epidemiological data (September of epidemic year 
                  <i>n-1</i> to August of epidemic year 
                  <i>n</i>). To handle missing data, only time series covering at least a full continuous year
                  were kept resulting in 67 locations for temperature, and 113 locations for rainfall
                  (see 
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004211.g001">Fig 1</span>). For each variable, at each weather station, we then calculated a typical year time-series,
                  365 days long, by averaging data recorded on the same day and month across the years
                  of the study period (i.e. we averaged data recorded every January 1
                  <sup>st</sup>, every January 2
                  <sup>nd</sup>, etc.). We then calculated the average of these 365 day-long time series. This average
                  is hereafter called “climate index”, thus obtaining one climate index for each climate
                  variable at each weather station.

                  we had to project the punctual station-based climate data to the same spatial level
                  as the epidemiological data (i.e. the commune level). In order to take into account
                  the fact that incidence rates are calculated from individual data, and the fact that

                  regarding the distribution of the response variable; hence there is no need for checking
                  the normality or homoscedasticity of residuals. As they are non-parametric, they are
                  also robust to collinearity between explanatory variables and, compared to classic
                  parametric non-linear models, there is no need for data exploration to specify the
                  shape of the link between the explanatory and the response variables. Another advantage
                  of using such non-linear models to begin with instead of classic linear ones is that
                  explanatory variables potentially linked to the response variable in a non-linear
                  way are not wrongly discarded.

               dengue spatial variability over New Caledonia. We thus decided to explore the evolution
               of dengue average annual incidence rates during epidemics under changing climate conditions
               (considering all others variables as remaining constant), by applying the best explicative
               multivariable model with inputs from maps of temperature for the future (see methods/data/climate
               covariates: assessing the trends of future mean temperature in New Caledonia). Because
               the use of kernels in non–linear SVM models impairs predictions outside the observed
               range of explanatory variables, we built a linear approximation of the best SVM model
               on present observed data. The linear approximation consists of a simple linear model
               linking the two best explanatory variables to observed dengue age-standardised average
               (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates as the response variable. Normality
               and homoscedasticity of residuals were confirmed by the Shapiro-Wilks' test and the
               Bartlett's test respectively [

               of mean temperature increase projections, we calculated, for each time-period and
               each scenario, the average annual incidence rates during epidemics as predicted by
               each GCM, and then calculated a standard deviation of predicted annual incidence rates

               range from 22 to 375 cases per 10,000 people per year, with a mean across communes

               and dengue age-standardised annual incidence rates averaged across epidemic years.
               Dengue is spatially positively correlated with variables related to temperature and
               precipitation, but is negatively correlated with variables reflecting mean thermal
               range or extreme thermal conditions (see "Isothermality", "Temp range" or the number
               of days when maximum temperature exceeds 32°C in January, February and March in 
               <span ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0004211.t001">
                  <a href="#pntd.0004211.t001">Table 1</a>
               </span>). This suggests that, in a given commune, marked temporal variations of temperature
               is a factor limiting viral circulation. Based on the linear dependence measure of
               correlation, dengue is also more strongly associated with temperature than with precipitation.
               Socio-economic variables are highly spatially correlated to dengue average (across
               epidemic years) annual incidence rates. Variables reflecting people's way of life
               (e.g. place of birth), local human density (e.g. mean number of people per household,
               percentage of premises under 40 m
               <sup>2</sup>), or human movement are more correlated with dengue average (across epidemic years)
               annual incidence rates than variables related to the housing type (e.g. premises with
               inside toilets) (absolute value of rho up to 0.75 for the former and 0.58 for the
               latter). In particular, the fact that the place where people were born is spatially
               significantly associated with dengue fever incidence rates (correlation coefficient
               around 0.5 for people born in New Caledonia and– 0.5 for people born elsewhere) whereas
               the type of premise is not (absolute correlation coefficient lower than 0.3 for variables
               describing access to water or electricity) suggests that individual behaviours have
               a stronger influence on incidence rates than local housing conditions.

               spatial climatic variability among communes. Temperature is highly correlated with
               the first PCA axis which represents 68% of the total climatic variance. Temperature
               and rainfall are not spatially correlated at the commune level. In each group of temperature
               or rainfall variables, the variables most spatially correlated with dengue average
               (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates were the average mean temperature (Mean

               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004211.g004">Fig 4B</span> shows that the spatial variability of socio-economic factors mainly reflects the
               spatial distribution of people with different cultural habits. Communes where a high
               proportion of inhabitants live in a tribal way, in small premises, with few means
               of transportation and a high percentage of unemployment are opposed to communes where
               many people live a western way of life, in permanent buildings, using air conditioning
               and getting around using cars. Even though the number of people per premise seems
               to be correlated with the proportion of people living in tribes, we kept this variable
               as it stands out of the cluster of variables representing the way of life. We thus
               decided to keep the percentage of unemployed people and the mean number of inhabitants
               per housing as representative of socio-economic factors for further statistical modelling.

               spatial heterogeneity of dengue average (across epidemic years) annual incidence rates
               is the percentage of unemployed people per commune. The second most important explanatory
               variable is the mean temperature. Rainfall is the least explanatory variable of those
               selected for multivariable regression modelling. Moreover, the RMSE of models based
               on observed rainfall almost equal the initial standard deviation (across the territory)
               of dengue average annual incidence rates, which means that rainfall are poor predictors
               of dengue average annual incidence rates during epidemic years. The relationship between
               dengue average annual incidence rates and each of the explanatory variables is linear,
               except for the fraction of unemployed people (
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004211.s004">S4 Fig</span>). When looking at the spatial structure of dengue average annual incidence rates
               predicted by SVM models based only on one of the selected variables (
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004211.s005">S5 Fig</span>), we see that temperature captures mainly the South to North gradient of increasing
               incidence rates (
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004211.s005">S5B Fig</span>) whereas socio-economic variables captures the spatial heterogeneity between the
               West coast and the East coast (
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004211.s005">S5E and S5F Fig</span>). Temperature seems to have no influence in communes located below 21°S (
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004211.s005">S5B Fig</span>).

               related to rainfall (best RMSE of ~58 cases per 10,000 people per year) performed
               worse than the best univariable model (RMSE of ~53 cases per 10,000 people per year).
               This suggests that in New Caledonia, rainfall has little influence on the spatial
               variability of dengue viral circulation at the commune level. Models combining two
               explanatory variables (excluding rainfall) performed better than models based on only
               one variable. The addition of a third explanatory variable did not improve significantly
               model performances. Hence we focused our attention on models combining two explanatory
               variables.

               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004211.g005">Fig 5A</span>. This model accurately predicts the sharp mean increase in incidence in the three
               communes of the North East of New Caledonia (Hienghène, Ouégoa and Pouébo). The maximal
               error of the model is observed for Farino (West coast), which is the only commune
               where all inhabitants live at an altitude higher than 200 m above sea level.

               see that in the future they might be affected as severely as communes at high risk
               now. These communes might not be prepared now to face severe epidemics of dengue fever,

               rates during epidemics for mean temperatures ranging from 22°C to 25°C can be explained
               by the effect of temperature on the mosquito life cycle and duration of extrinsic
               incubation period. Here, by applying a statistical model built using current observed
               temperature to future projections, we make the assumption that the biological effect
               of temperature on the mosquito life cycle and on the extrinsic incubation will remain
               the same under the range of temperature that might be observed in the future. For
               most parameters influencing transmission, this assumption is reasonable. For example,
               we know that in Thaïland, for DENV-2, the extrinsic incubation period is reduced from
               15 days at 30°C to 7 days at 32–35°C [

               </span>], which is in support of increasing temperatures inducing an increase in dengue incidence
               rates under future climate. However, because we used a statistical model, we were
               not able to incorporate the known negative effect that an increase in temperature
               might have on dengue transmission when temperature reaches extremes. For example,
               a review of fifty mark-release-recapture studies has shown that the survival and longevity
               of 
               <i>Ae</i>.

               of possible non-linear links between the response and the explanatory variables, or

               of meteorological data observed at precise locations to the same spatial level of
               aggregation as the epidemiological data. In existing spatial studies of dengue fever
               at a national scale, authors have geo-spatially interpolated climate variables on
               regular grids using kriging methods, and have averaged gridded values over a given
               administrative division [

               </span>]. This approach has two drawbacks in New Caledonia. Simple kriging models do not
               take into account the potential elevation between two given points, leading to biased
               estimates of temperature in mountainous regions. Moreover, the traditional approach
               used in climatology, which consist in aggregating temperature over grid points taken
               uniformly over the whole aggregative area makes the implicit assumption that people
               at risk are distributed homogeneously over the aggregative area. This is particularly
               problematic in New Caledonia where large areas are not inhabited. In our approach,
               as epidemiological data are collected at the individual level, we tried to estimate
               the climate conditions for each individual (and therefore for the mosquitoes surrounding
               each individual). However, the algorithm used introduces some noise, due to the fact
               that the weather stations are sometimes kilometres away from some towns or tribes.
               High spatial resolution climate data obtained from high resolution modelling of atmospheric
               conditions could be used, but some noise will be introduced by the modelling error
               compared to the observed data. This issue needs further attention in the future to
               increase the quality of spatial epidemiological and environmental studies.

               epidemics have not been taken into account in this study: the location of the first
               cases introduced each year, the spatial variability in population immunity, viral
               factors such as the serotype circulating, or factors associated to the mosquito such
               as the spatial variability in vector competence, or dengue vector control measures.
               We decided not to include the serotype, as we performed the analysis on averages over
               several years, and as, except in 2009, there was no co-circulation of different serotypes
               over the territory. Therefore, spatial differences in the level of viral circulation
               cannot be associated with genetic differences between serotypes. A territorial seroprevalence
               survey to assess population immunity has been implemented recently in New Caledonia,
               but data are not available yet. It could be interesting to include environmental variables
               derived from GIS data or remote-sensing in this kind of study. For example, GIS data
               about built areas could be used to create indicators of the proximity of houses to
               reflect the fragmentation of the 
               <i>Ae</i>. 
               <i>aegypti</i> habitat per commune, given that fragmentation of this habitat could potentially slow
               down viral circulation. The amount of vector control effort implemented in each commune
               is heterogeneous on the territory, as this activity falls within the commune’s authority,
               and each commune is free to implement or not the territorial guidelines. The vector
               control effort in each commune is thus difficult to quantify, and data were not available
               yet at the time of analysis. As soon as these data will be collected by local authorities,
               they could be incorporated in the modelling process to assess the efficiency of vector
               control measures.
