            <i>Glossina</i> hytrosavirus (family 
            <i>Hytrosaviridae</i>) is a double-stranded DNA virus with rod-shaped, enveloped virions. Its 190 kbp genome
            encodes 160 putative open reading frames. The virus replicates in the nucleus, and
            acquires a fragile envelope in the cell cytoplasm. 
            <i>Glossina</i> hytrosavirus was first isolated from hypertrophied salivary glands of the tsetse
            fly, 
            <i>Glossina pallidipes</i> Austen (Diptera; Glossinidae) collected in Kenya in 1986. A certain proportion of
            laboratory 
            <i>G. pallidipes</i> flies infected by 
            <i>Glossina</i> hytrosavirus develop hypertrophied salivary glands and midgut epithelial cells, gonadal
            anomalies and distorted sex-ratios associated with reduced insemination rates, fecundity
            and lifespan. These symptoms are rare in wild tsetse populations. In East Africa,
            
            <i>G. pallidipes</i> is one of the most important vectors of African trypanosomosis, a debilitating zoonotic
            disease that afflicts 37 sub-Saharan African countries. There is a large arsenal of
            control tactics available to manage tsetse flies and the disease they transmit. The
            sterile insect technique (SIT) is a robust control tactic that has shown to be effective
            in eradicating tsetse populations when integrated with other control tactics in an
            area-wide integrated approach. The SIT requires production of sterile male flies in
            large production facilities. To supply sufficient numbers of sterile males for the
            SIT component against 
            <i>G. pallidipes</i>, strategies have to be developed that enable the management of the 
            <i>Glossina</i> hytrosavirus in the colonies. This review provides a historic chronology of the emergence
            and biogeography of 
            <i>Glossina</i> hytrosavirus, and includes researches on the infectomics (defined here as the functional
            and structural genomics and proteomics) and pathobiology of the virus. Standard operation
            procedures for viral management in tsetse mass-rearing facilities are proposed and
            a future outlook is sketched.

            populations that primarily depend on small-scale agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry
            and hunting. Resurgence and epidemics of HAT are often associated with economic decline,

            either AAT or HAT. None of the available trypanocidal drugs for HAT is ideal; their
            treatment schedules are prolonged, excruciatingly painful (often described by patients
            as “fire in the veins”), and require continuous hospitalization [

            the tsetse hosts’ midguts, then migrate into the ectoperitrophic space, and via the
            alimentary canal to the salivary glands or the mouth parts [

            </span>]. The parasites differentiate into the final mammalian-infective form (trypomastigocyte)
            in the tsetse salivary glands, and are then transmitted to the mammalian host by an
            infected tsetse bite [

            </span>]. It should however, be noted that some steps in the lifecycle of trypanosomes are
            group-specific. For instance, members of the 
            <i>T. vivax</i> group only stays in the proboscis, the 
            <i>T. congolense</i> group has a lifecycle involving the proboscis and the midguts, while only the

            of HAT is that the patients are usually so weak that they are more likely to die from
            the treatment rather than from the disease. In addition, patients need to be properly
            fed for several weeks to regain strength before commencement of treatments. This presents
            a very serious problem considering that there are hardly any available funds to properly
            feed or purchase drugs for HAT treatment. The available drugs for AAT are overly expensive
            for African peasant farmers and there are reports of increasing drug-resistance [

            compared to other insects of medical and agricultural importance, tsetse flies have
            a very low reproduction rate (

            stable habitats offered by vertebrate nests or human dwellings with low levels of
            cross-breeding. This means that tsetse flies have reduced genetic variability within
            each vector population and therefore, have limited capacity to respond through selection
            pressures to various control interventions [

            Since the methods cannot be sustained beyond the time of these external donor-funded
            projects, the risk of the cleared areas being re-infested by tsetse flies increases.
            In the light of these developments, there was a need to explore other tsetse control
            methods.

            their reproductive capacity. He likewise modeled that a target population could be
            eradicated when the release of sterile males was applied on an area-wide basis against
            an entire insect pest populations in a delineated area [

            </span>]. This method, commonly known as the sterile insect technique (SIT), involves large-scale
            production of insects in laboratory colonies in mass-rearing facilities. The male
            flies are then sexually-sterilized by exposure to a precise and specific dose of ionizing
            radiation, usually from a 
            <sup>60</sup>Co or

            </span>]. The sterile males are then sequentially released into the target insect population
            in numbers that allows them to out-compete wild type males for wild virgin females

            </span>]. After the virgin females mate with the sterile males, embryogenesis is arrested
            and consequently no viable offspring is produced. When the release of the sterile
            males is sustained, the size of the target insect population declines and can become
            extinct. The SIT is a robust control tactic that has been used very successfully against
            insect pests that are important in agriculture and trade. For instance, SIT was used
            to control Mediterranean fruit fly 
            <i>Ceratitis capitata</i> (Diptera: Tephritidae) populations in Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Central America,

               the lack of detectable father-to-progeny viral transmission may result from reduced
               transmission rates, rather than a total failure of transmission. The phenomenon of
               father-to-progeny virus transmission has been demonstrated in other insect viruses.
               For instance, in the sigma viruses (
               <i>Rhabdoviridae</i>), the apparent failure of father-to-progeny transmission of the sigma virus in 
               <i>Drosophila</i> was attributed to transfer of very low viral titers to the developing embryo via
               the sperm [

               </span>]. In the case of sigma viruses, the virus fails to infect early germ cells and thus
               prevents gamete-infection, even though viral titers in the somatic cells may increase
               later when the fly reaches adulthood [

               cannot be totally ruled out. This revelation implies that, under undefined conditions,
               the virus is reactivated from a “latent” state to a symptomatic state [

               several implications. Firstly, the conserved nature of the

               the hytrosaviruses, baculoviruses, nudiviruses and nimaviruses. Secondly, the presence

               mode of transcriptional regulation and DNA replication [

               </span>]. Thirdly, the presence of the ORFs potentially encoding orthologues of cellular
               proteins may be advantageous for the viral infection. For instance, it has been suggested
               that large DNA viruses gain independence of the transcription and replication machineries
               of their hosts by encoding their own functional cellular orthologues of cellular proteins,

               infection within 48 h post oral infection [

               latency is an evolutionary viral strategy to utilize cues from the host and/or environment
               as opportunities for dispersal and transmission. In 1992, Fuxa 
               <i>et al</i>. argued that in the adults of the armyworm 
               <i>S frugiperda</i> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) latency may provide dispersal and reproductive advantages
               to 
               <i>S frugiperda</i> nucleopolyhedrovirus (SfNPV) [

               </span>]. As the insect host metamorphoses to adulthood, vertical transmission becomes epizootiologically
               more important than horizontal transmission. The virus, therefore, takes advantage
               of the changes in the infected cells’ quality to produce nonlethal, vertically transferable
               virions. In 1993, Hughes 
               <i>et al</i>. described a latent infection in a laboratory colony of the cabbage moth, 
               <i>Mamestra brassicae</i> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) that was vertically transferred from one generation to another

               </span>]. Latency may also be connected to the antiviral response mechanisms of the hosts.
               Recently, it has been found that invertebrate DNA viruses, such as baculoviruses,
               iridoviruses and nudiviruses, provoke a specific RNA interference (RNAi) or microRNA
               response, which may prevent premature death of the host by preventing viral over-replication

               in which viruses are vertically transmitted is by integrating into the host genome.
               For instance, the dsDNA polydnaviruses (PDVs) are vertically transmitted as proviruses
               stably integrated into the genomes of the parasitic wasps, ichneumonid (Hymenoptera;
               Ichneumonoidae) and braconid (Hymenoptera; Braconidae) [

                  </sup>
               </span>]. Another strategy of vertical viral transmission is as infectious virions, such
               as the 
               <i>gypsy</i> elements in 
               <i>D. melanogaster</i>, which are transmitted as infectious particles from mother to progeny via oocytes

               </span>]. Other insect viruses are maternally transmitted to the progeny flies, but also
               rely on horizontal transmission to be sustained in the host populations. An example
               of a virus utilizing this strategy is the DNA 
               <i>Leptopilina boulardi</i> filamentous virus (LbFV) that infects the solitary parasitic wasp 
               <i>L. boulardi</i> (Hymenoptera: Figitidae). When both an LbFV-infected and a non-infected female wasp
               lay eggs in 
               <i>Drosophila</i> larvae during oviposition, LbFV is horizontally transmitted to the offspring of the

               </span>], survival of 
               <i>G. pallidipes</i> colonies may depend on the infection status of the mothers: all F
               <div tagxxx="sub">2</div> progeny flies produced by symptomatic mothers are sterile. Males with SGH symptoms
               are fully sterile and do release GpSGHV particles into blood via saliva during membrane
               feeding, and thus have a considerable impact on colony survival. Secondly, the observations
               that symptomatic flies die-off from the colony early in their life-span, and that
               asymptomatic flies have a relatively higher efficiency in salivary virus secretion
               compared to the symptomatic flies (Kariithi, unpublished) imply that asymptomatic
               flies may have more influence on the dynamics of GpSGHV transmission in the colonies

               <i>G. pallidipes</i> flies were orally-infected with GpSGHV, the viral titers increased with the number
               of contaminated blood meals taken by the flies [

                  </sup>
               </span>]. In marked contrast to tsetse flies, house flies are resistant to oral MdSGHV infections
               after 24 h post emergence (hpe) [

               </span>]. It can therefore be concluded that it is not the feeding history, but rather the
               age (hpe) of the tsetse fly when it takes the first (infective) meal that determines
               the fly’s susceptibility to viral infection [

            <i>G. pallidipes</i> result in SGH syndrome in the same (parental) generation, rather, the syndrome is

            Thirdly, 
            <i>in vitro</i> mass production of GpSGHV for field applications is currently impossible due to limitations
            such as the absence of a cell culture system permissive to the virus. Currently, the
            only alternative method to multiply GpSGHV is by intra hemocoelic injection of the
            virus into colony flies, or by feeding the flies with virus-contaminated blood meals.
            Even if it were feasible to multiply GpSGHV by the injection method, it is a laborious
            process, and would require maintenance of huge number of flies. Fourthly, there is
            no available evidence for horizontal transmission of GpSGHV through contact between
            flies, mating, or fecal contamination, thus limiting the modes of how the virus would
            be dispersed in the field. Finally, GpSGHV does not produce occlusion bodies, as for

            <h3>8.2. Modifications of 
               <i>in vitro</i> Membrane Feeding Regime

            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The objective of various research reviewed in this paper was the development of a
               cost-effective strategy to manage the GpSGHV infections in 
               <i>G. pallidipes</i> colonies. This was finally achieved mainly by modification of the 
               <i>in vitro</i> membrane feeding regime routinely practiced in tsetse mass-rearing facilities. Since
               the membrane feeding favored horizontal viral transmission, it was conceptualized
               that modifications of the colony maintenance protocol(s) would significantly reduce
               GpSGHV transmission. The routine 
               <i>in vitro</i> feeding regime involved feeding up to 10 sets of fly cages in succession [

               </span>], thus significantly augmenting horizontal GpSGHV transmission in the colonies. In
               the modified feeding regime, each fly-holding cage was provided with fresh blood at
               each meal to prevent flies from picking up any virus deposited via saliva into the

               </span>]. Within 2 years of implementation of the modified feeding regime, GpSGHV loads in
               the fly colonies were significantly reduced and maintained at levels not detrimental
               to the survival and productivity of the colonies. More importantly, the SGH syndrome

               </span>]. Additionally, the modified feeding regime is applicable in combination with other
               management strategies, for instance oral administration of the antiviral drugs in

               sterile males between 1994 to 1997, resulting in a crash of the

               </span>]. However, attempts to mass-produce 
               <i>G. pallidipes</i> for the SIT component of AW-IMP programs on mainland Africa were faced with difficulties
               because this tsetse species is susceptible to infections by GpSGHV. The virus has
               caused collapse of 
               <i>G. pallidipes</i> colonies that were initiated in Ethiopia and Seibersdorf, Austria, and thus prevented
               full implementation of the release component. Now that strategies are available to
               successfully manage GpSGHV infections that can result in complete elimination of SGH
               from 
               <i>G. pallidipes</i> colonies, production of sufficient numbers of sterile males is within reach. This
               success provides opportunity to revive the SIT component of the program to eradicate
               
               <i>G. pallidipes</i> from the fertile Rift Valley lands of Ethiopia [

               </span>]. This would translate into availability of more animals for plowing the fertile
               land, more milk, and manures to plant crops—in short, a permanent eradication of poverty
               and improvement of living standards. Similarly, other sub-Sahara African countries
               infested with trypanosome-transmitting tsetse species would benefit from this success.
               It should be noted that, although GpSGHV has not been shown to cause serious problems
               in other tsetse species, the virus infects 
               <i>G. fuscipes fuscipes</i>, 
               <i>G. morsitans</i> and 
               <i>G. swynnertoni</i>, irrespective of their ages, sex, and season of the year [

               current knowledge and experiences in large-scale production of
