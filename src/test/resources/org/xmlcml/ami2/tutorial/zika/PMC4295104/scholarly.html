         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>After taking vertebrate blood, female mosquitoes quickly shed excess water and ions
            while retaining and concentrating the mostly proteinaceous nutrients. Aquaporins (AQPs)
            are an evolutionary conserved family of membrane transporter proteins that regulate
            the flow of water and in some cases glycerol and other small molecules across cellular
            membranes. In a previous study, we found six putative AQP genes in the genome of the
            yellow fever mosquito, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, and demonstrated the involvement of three of them in the blood meal-induced diuresis.
            Here we characterized AQP expression in different tissues before and after a blood
            meal, explored the substrate specificity of AQPs expressed in the Malpighian tubules
            and performed RNAi-mediated knockdown and tested for changes in mosquito desiccation
            resistance. We found that AQPs are generally down-regulated 24â€…hrs after a blood meal.
            
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQP 1 strictly transports water, AQP 2 and 5 demonstrate limited solute transport,
            but primarily function as water transporters. AQP 4 is an aquaglyceroporin with multiple
            substrates. Knockdown of AQPs expressed in the MTs increased survival of 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> under dry conditions. We conclude that Malpighian tubules of adult female yellow
            fever mosquitoes utilize three distinct AQPs and one aquaglyceroporin in their osmoregulatory
            functions.

      <p>The yellow fever mosquito, 
         <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, is a tropical mosquito with a worldwide distribution. It is the vector for dengue,
         yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses and it also transmits lesser known pathogens
         such as Zika virus

      </p>
      <p>As an anautogenous mosquito, 
         <i>Ae. aegypti</i> females require the uptake of vertebrate blood for reproduction. Blood meals are
         relatively large and can more than double the mass of a mosquito within a couple of
         minutes. Shortly after beginning a blood meal, mosquitoes start to produce large amounts
         of urine in order to concentrate the nutrients taken up and to eliminate excess sodium
         from the blood. They begin ejecting droplets of urine while still blood feeding
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">

               <a href="#b4">4</a>
            </sup>
         </span>. In order to move this large volume of water, females use their highly efficient
         excretion system. Water and solutes are absorbed by the midgut into the hemolymph
         and from there are secreted by the Malpighian tubules (MTs) back into the alimentary
         canal where it is excreted through the hindgut and rectum

               <a href="#b5">5</a>
            </sup>
         </span>. MTs are the functional equivalent of vertebrate kidneys and contain protein channels
         and transporters that facilitate the transport of water and other solutes across the
         basal and apical membrane of their cells.
      </p>
      <p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of membrane transporters that regulate the flow of
         water and in some cases other small molecules across cellular membranes in both prokaryotic
         and eukaryotic cells and they are important players in the mosquito excretory system

            </sup>
         </span>. There are 13 AQP genes in mammals, which consist of two subfamilies. The first subfamily
         is the AQPs, which are thought to pass only water, the second are the aquaglyceroporins,
         which in addition to water pass small, nonpolar solutes like glycerol and urea

         </span>. The AQP channel forms an hourglass structure with six transmembrane alpha helical
         domains connected by five extramembrane loops. The asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA)
         motif is in the center of the pore and forms a ring

         the channel. Previous studies have shown that Hg
         <sup>2+</sup> ions can interact with a cysteine residue near the NPA motif and block the flow of
         water molecules through the channel of most AQPs. Aquaglyceroporins differ from AQPs

      </p>
      <p>In earlier work, we surveyed the genome of 
         <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and identified six putative AQP genes
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">
            <sup>
               <a href="#b12">12</a>
            </sup>
         </span>. Combining microarray, reverse transcription and qPCR data, we found that all six
         AQPs are expressed in distinct patterns in the female mosquito and at different time
         points before and after a blood meal. RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQPs 1, 4, or 5 significantly
         reduced the ability of mosquitoes to excrete injected saline
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">
            <sup>
               <a href="#b13">13</a>
            </sup>
         </span>. Furthermore, the simultaneous knockdown of AQPs 1, 2, 4, and 5 further reduced the
         excretion rate. This suggests that AQPs 1, 4, and 5 form the primary water channels
         in 
         <i>Ae. aegypti</i> MTs.
      </p>
      <p>Here we have confirmed that the AQPs expressed in the MTs (AQPs 1, 2, 4, and 5) function
         as water channels and mediate transcellular water transport in adult female 
         <i>Ae</i>. 
         <i>aegypti</i>. We demonstrate that these proteins are indeed water channels and that AQP 4 is a
         multifunctional aquaglyceroporin that is capable of transporting a wide range of solutes.
         Lastly, individually knocking down AQPs 1, 4, and 5 increased the resistance of mosquitoes
         to desiccation stress.

            <h3>Tissue expression</h3>
            <p>We used qPCR to evaluate relative AQP mRNA expression in different parts of the alimentary
               canal in female mosquitoes at two time points - 72â€…hrs post eclosion (PE) and 24â€…hrs
               post blood meal (PBM). We found that each AQP had a varied expression profile throughout
               the different organs/tissues observed (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</span>). AQP 1 was significantly upregulated in the midgut (MG) and the MTs PE. We observed
               a trend in AQP 1 expression in the hindgut (HG) PE, but it was not significantly upregulated.
               AQP 1 was downregulated in these tissues PBM. AQP 2 was significantly expressed in
               the foregut (FG), MG, and HG, and we observed a trend in the expression in the MTs
               PE, but this was not significant. This AQP was downregulated in these tissues PBM.
               There is no significant difference in AQP 3 expression levels in all the tissues before
               and after a blood meal. AQP 4 was significantly upregulated in the MTs and we observed
               a trend in expression levels in the MG PE, but this was not significant. These expression
               levels were downregulated PBM. AQP 5 is significantly upregulated in the MTs PE. We
               also observed a trend in AQP 5 expression in the MG PE, but this was not significant.
               AQP 5 expression was downregulated in these tissues PBM. There is no significant difference
               in AQP 6 expression levels in all the tissues before and after a blood meal.

            <p>
               <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes are naturally impermeable to water and thereby are an ideal model system

                  </sup>
               </span>. Negative control water-injected oocytes swelled minimally and failed to rupture
               even after extended incubation times. The cRNAs encoding Myc-tagged 
               <i>Ae</i>. 
               <i>aegypti</i> AQPs 1, 2, 4, or 5 were injected into 
               <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and AQP protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</span>). Oocytes expressing AQP 1, 2, or 5 showed significantly higher water permeability
               compared to the control (water-injected) oocytes; water permeation was inhibited when
               the oocytes were placed in 1â€…mM HgCl
               <div tagxxx="sub">2</div> solution (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</span>). There were no changes in the water permeation of the control oocytes in the HgCl
               <div tagxxx="sub">2</div> solution, consistent with nominal endogenous AQP expression.

            <h3>Solute uptake assays</h3>
            <p>To investigate the substrate specificities of the 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQPs, they were expressed in 
               <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, which were subsequently subjected to non-radiolabeled solute transport analyses
               with six different solutes: glycerol, urea, erythritol, adonitol, mannitol, and trehalose
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</span>). AQP 1-expressing oocytes closely resembled the water-injected oocytes and did not
               demonstrate significant solute uptake. AQP 2-expressing oocytes also did not show
               significant solute uptake compared to the water-injected oocytes. Oocytes injected
               with AQP 4 cRNA consistently swelled in various test solutes to ~1.3 times their initial
               volume and ruptured within minutes. AQP 4 did not function as a strong water transporter
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</span>), but this AQP has significant transport capabilities for all other solutes tested
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</span>). AQP 5 demonstrated significantly high solute transport for trehalose. The results
               show a trend in the uptake of erythritol and adonitol via AQP 5, but the solute uptake
               was not significantly different than the water-injected oocytes.

            <h3>Mosquito desiccation resistance assays</h3>
            <p>AQPs 1, 4, and 5 were knocked down individually in adult female 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes 72â€…hrs PE by injecting dsRNA followed by a three day recovery period.
               The desiccation assay measures the viability of the mosquitoes in dry conditions.
               We did not include AQP 2 in this experiment since 
               <i>in-vivo</i> diuresis assays performed in Drake et al., 2010 did not result in a significant rate
               of excretion for the AQP 2 knockdown group of mosquitoes

               </span>. Therefore, AQP 2 appears to be a relatively inefficient water transporter.
            </p>
            <p>Groups of five mosquitoes were placed in tubes with desiccant (&lt;20% humidity) and
               the survival of the mosquitoes was recorded at 30â€…minute intervals until all mosquitoes
               died. All three AQP-knockdown groups survived significantly longer than the control
               group (eGFP) under these conditions (

         <p>In 2005, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes were distributed throughout 23 of the United States in South and South-eastern
            regions including Southern Florida, Gulf coast of Texas and Louisiana. Recently, this
            distribution has spread to more arid and dry regions, such as Arizona and New Mexico.
            This raises the question as to how this tropical mosquito manages water conservation
            in the desert. Previous studies have shown that AQPs play a role in insect desiccation
            resistance and cold hardiness. For example, RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQP 1 in 
            <i>Anopheles</i>
            <i>gambiae</i> resulted in significantly longer survival of the knockdown group compared with the

            adult mosquitoes. More specifically, the ability of 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> to conserve water in an extremely dry environment was significantly enhanced after
            RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQPs 1, 4, and 5 (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</span>). This suggests that the regulation of AQP expression in the alimentary canal could
            be an adaptive strategy to attenuate excretory water losses when 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> are exposed to an arid environment. How this is balanced with the need for rapid
            excretion after a blood meal is an interesting topic for future studies.
         </p>
         <p>In summary, our current findings confirm that 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQPs 1, 2, and 5 transport water and are involved in the regulation of mosquito water
            homeostasis. AQP 4 is a multifunctional aquaglyceroporin with a wide range of solute
            transport capabilities. AQP 5 also functions as a limited aquaglyceroporin in 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. Down regulation of AQPs 1, 4, and 5 enhanced mosquito desiccation resistance. Our
            data provide a basis for further investigation into the transport capabilities of
            mosquito AQPs. Further research is necessary to determine how expression and activity
            of these AQPs are regulated in mosquitoes.

               sets with T7 sequence attached (TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG). The PCR product was used as
               a template for dsRNA synthesis using the MEGAscript T7 Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). eGFP
               dsRNA was used as a control. 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes 5â€“6 day post-emergence were collected by aspiration. 1000â€…ng of dsRNA
               in 268â€…nl of RNAase-free H2O was injected into the thorax of CO2-anesthetized female
               
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes three days after emergence. The injected mosquitoes were allowed to recover
               for three days before the desiccation assay was performed. The knockdown was confirmed
               with qPCR at 3 days post-injection of dsRNA with knockdown efficiencies between 60â€“95%.
               On day 3 post-injection, groups of five mosquitoes for each treatment were placed
               in 50â€…ml falcon tubes (six replicate tubes for each treatment) with 16â€…g of 8-mesh

                  Î¼m/sec. There were six solutes tested, in each AQP group n = 5. The molecular structure
                  of each solute is indicated above each graph. The means were separated by the Tukey-Kramer
                  HSD (p &lt; 0.05). Means which share the same letter are not significantly different.
