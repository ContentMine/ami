               <i>Aedes aegypti</i> is a cosmopolite mosquito, vector of arboviruses. The worldwide studies of its insecticide
               resistance have demonstrated a strong loss of susceptibility to pyrethroids, the major
               class of insecticide used for vector control. French overseas territories such as
               French Guiana (South America), Guadeloupe islands (Lesser Antilles) as well as New

               <i>Aedes aegypti</i> populations were tested for their deltamethrin resistance level then screened by
               an improved microarray developed to specifically study metabolic resistance mechanisms.
               Cytochrome P450 genes were implicated in conferring resistance.

               strongly suggested. Other genes from detoxification pathways were also differentially

            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> is vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses, all causing emerging or re-emerging
            diseases worldwide. Fighting these diseases relies on the control of the vector. Therefore,
            insecticides have been extensively used worldwide, resulting in the development of
            insecticide resistance. In the French overseas territories, resistance to pyrethroids
            has been monitored for many years with high levels in the South American French territories.
            We then investigated the mechanisms underlying this resistance in populations from
            French Guiana, Guadeloupe and New Caledonia. Transcription levels of detoxification
            genes were measured and alongside screening for target site mutations. Upregulation
            of cytochrome P450 genes and carboxylesterases were observed in all three populations.
            Mutations related to pyrethroid resistance in position 1016 and 1534 of the voltage-gated
            sodium channel gene were also observed. French Guiana and Guadeloupe populations presented
            a closer profile of resistance mechanisms whereas the New Caledonia population had
            a more restricted profile. Such differences can be explained by different vector control
            practices, regional insecticide uses and genetic backgrounds. These results are also
            compared with others obtained from other parts of the world and are discussed with
            the perspective of integrative research on vector competence.

            <i>Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti</i> (Linnaeus, 1762) is a mosquito species of high medical importance due to its widespread
            distribution and ability to transmit a variety of arboviruses. For decades its control
            has involved mechanical elimination of breeding sites as well as larvicidal applications
            and adulticide spatial spraying operations. However, the efficacy of these insecticide
            treatments has been reduced due to the development of resistance in this species.
            French overseas territories such as French Guiana, Martinique and Guadeloupe (French
            Territories in the Americas, FTAs), and New Caledonia (West Pacific) have all experienced
            insecticide resistance in

            territories that once used organochlorine (OC), organosphosphate (OP), pyrethroids
            (PY) and bioinsecticides insecticides successfully have observed the development of
            vector resistance to the majority of them with the exception of bio-insecticides.
            Since the prohibition of the sale and use of many biocide products by the European
            Community (EC), the FTAs are facing a dilemma in their vector control strategies.
            Despite the fact that pyrethroids have the highest level of resistance in 
            <i>Ae</i>. 
            <i>aegypti</i>, they are the only insecticide family authorised for mosquito control.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Vector control strategies depend on the decisions of local authorities, which differ
            from one territory to another. The French Guianan program of surveillance and management
            of dengue cases conducts 
            <i>Ae</i>. 
            <i>aegypti</i> density reduction throughout the year which is intensified during outbreaks. Vector
            control activities include both indoor and outdoor spatial spraying of deltamethrin
            (PY) against adults and the removal of breeding sites or their treatment with 
            <i>Bacillus thuringiensis</i> var. 
            <i>israelensis</i> (Bti) based larvicides. Deltamethrin is also used routinely for pest mosquito management.
            In contrast, the territory of Guadeloupe limits the use of insecticides to only during
            dengue and other arbovirosis epidemics and focuses on larval elimination during non-epidemic
            periods. In New Caledonia, where EC regulations do not apply, the local government
            conducts regular monitoring of insecticide resistance that has led to a switch from
            deltamethrin to malathion (OP) in zones where PY resistance was detected in 2003.
            Adulticides are sprayed in a 100 meter-radius around dengue, Chikungunya or Zika fever
            cases, which is coupled with mosquito source reduction and community awareness raising
            campaigns.

            the membrane voltage-gated sodium channel inducing insensitivity to the insecticide
            and absence of knock-down effect (
            <i>kdr</i>). This mechanism confers cross-resistance to PYs and DDT [

               </sup>
            </span>]. The second recognized mechanism is an overproduction of detoxifying enzymes, also
            called metabolic resistance. These enzymes are naturally involved in the degradation
            or transformation of toxic compounds into non-toxic products before elimination or
            sequestration into the insect body. Three large enzyme families, the cytochrome P450
            monooxygenases (P450s), Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and carboxy/cholinesterases
            (CCEs) have been implicated in the metabolism of insecticides in insects. Throughout
            the species’ range, 
            <i>Ae</i>. 
            <i>aegypti</i> populations have shown strong resistance to pyrethroid, carbamate and organophosphate
            insecticides correlated with elevated activities of detoxifying enzymes and

            However, while some of these genes are related to insecticide resistance, others are
            a response to environmental and evolutionary factors. The study of several mosquito
            populations could identify a common pattern of genes associated with pyrethroid resistance
            and eliminate those associated with environmental factors.

            <i>Culicidae</i> family. Serine proteases are key enzymes in mosquito metabolism and play a role in
            pyrethroid degradation but their role in the detoxification process must be explored
            along with its impact on vector competence.

            competence variability. Indeed, CYP450 enzymes are membrane-bound hemoproteins, which
            require the activity of NADPH P450 oxidoreductase and sometimes cytochrome b5 to function.
            Enzyme activity is also regulated by phosphatases, kinases and phosphorylases [

               </sup>
            </span>]. In addition, oxido-reduction enzymes are also involved in processing the products
            of detoxifying enzymes. The presence of up- or down-regulation of those transcripts
            is then not surprising in our study and are often over transcribed in pyrethroid resistant
            populations [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Investigating insecticide detoxification pathways is in itself important but the
            importance is elevated as because some of those enzyme families could mediate arbovirus
            infection in mosquito cells [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pntd.0004226.ref052">

               </sup>

            vector competence and disease dynamics.

            <i>Ae</i>. 
            <i>aegypti</i> populations with different levels of resistance to identify which mechanisms may
            be common and therefore important for resistance development. Amongst the diversity
            and complexity of resistance, it is essential to identify key markers in order to
            develop easy-to-use diagnostic tools. Neither the geographic location, resistance
            levels nor historical use of insecticides can fully explain the distribution of one
            or another mechanism of resistance. It is then essential to integrate all of the factors
            that may impact resistance 
            <i>in vivo</i> and also 
            <i>in vitro</i> to get the best picture, the most reliable data in order to develop predictive tools.
            In this study, a set of genes were highlighted and which can serve as a basis for
            further studies on the factors which may induce, develop and maintain the expression
            of those genes. The role that enzymes may play alone or in association with resistance
            phenotypes and the consequences of over-expression of those genes on other physiological
            and cellular processes should then be investigated.
