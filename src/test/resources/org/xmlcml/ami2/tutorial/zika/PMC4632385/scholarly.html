         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Dengue is an arthropod-borne viral disease caused by four antigenically different
            serotypes of dengue virus. This disease is considered as a major public health concern
            around the world. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or antiviral drug available
            for the prevention and treatment of dengue disease. Moreover, clinical features of
            dengue are indistinguishable from other infectious diseases such as malaria, chikungunya,
            rickettsia and leptospira. Therefore, prompt and accurate laboratory diagnostic test
            is urgently required for disease confirmation and patient triage. The traditional
            diagnostic techniques for the dengue virus are viral detection in cell culture, serological
            testing, and RNA amplification using reverse transcriptase PCR. This paper discusses
            the conventional laboratory methods used for the diagnosis of dengue during the acute
            and convalescent phase and highlights the advantages and limitations of these routine
            laboratory tests. Subsequently, the biosensor based assays developed using various
            transducers for the detection of dengue are also reviewed.

            of the world and associated with endemic as well as in epidemic transmission cycles.
            Dengue usually causes inapparent infection, but it could also lead to other wide range
            of clinical symptoms/diseases including mild dengue fever and severe dengue [

            </span>]. This disease is caused by dengue virus (DENV), which is a member of the 
            <i>Flavivirus</i> genus within the 
            <i>Flaviviridae</i> family. This virus is classified into four antigenically related but genetically
            distinctive serotypes, DENV-1, -2, -3 and DENV-4. The four DENV serotypes differ in
            the nucleotide sequence by 25–35 base pairs and each serotype is capable of causing
            dengue. Out of these four different serotypes, DENV-4 appears to be the most divergent
            serotype followed by DENV-2 while DENV-1 and DENV-3 are more closely related [

            comprising approximately 1100 nucleotide base. Translation of viral RNA produces a
            single polypeptide, which upon the proteolytic cleavage by proteases results in the
            formation of three structural proteins (capsid, membrane and envelope) and seven non-structural
            (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5) [

                  specimens into mosquitoes, various 
                  <i>in vitro</i> cultured cell lines, and intracerebrally in mice. Usually, common specimens including
                  plasma, serum, peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid and immune system
                  tissues such as the liver, spleen and lymph node are used for virus culture. After
                  the cultivation of the specimen, a confirmation assay that includes immunofluorescence
                  assay or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is performed once
                  cytopathic effect in infected cells is observed. Although virus isolation method provides
                  high specificity, various practical aspects limit its use. First, this technique is
                  tedious and requires long incubation time (7–12 days) for virus cultivation and confirmation

                  </span>]. Lastly, the optimal window for culturing the virus is limited to 0–7 days following
                  the onset of symptoms, as DENV is detectable only during the acute phase of infection,
                  prior to development of dengue specific antibody response [

                     to appear while IgG antibody appears after a few days of IgM appearance. In contrast,
                     during secondary DENV infection, IgG antibody is the first to appear after onset of
                     symptoms while IgM antibodies appear after a few days at low titer or even undetectable

                     IgG capture ELISA (GAC-ELISA) is the most commonly employed format, in addition to
                     indirect IgG ELISA detection method. The IgG ELISA assay uses similar polyvalent viral
                     antigen as the MAC-ELISA and has a good correlation with HI assay. Meanwhile, IgG
                     avidity test can be used to classify between primary and a secondary dengue infection
                     in patient sera. This avidity test is based on the principle that the first antibodies
                     produced after primary infection exhibit low avidity (binding affinity) to an antigen
                     than those produced later [

               dengue assays in many countries. Although ELISA based assay have been shown to be
               more sensitive than RDTs, the former test lacks portability and thus, preventing its
               use in private clinics and field work. Because of this, many researchers have delved
               into biosensors as alternative new technology for the detection of DENV and dengue
               antibodies since this technique has several advantages such as higher sensitivity,
               cost-effective, simple fabrication, possible miniaturization, rapid outcome with quantitative
               analysis and possible on-site monitoring [

                  spectroscopy analysis developed to discriminate serum glycoproteins in dengue-infected
                  patients. The lectin was introduced as an alternative to a monoclonal antibody to
                  detect dengue serum glycoprotein (SG). Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that
                  are highly specific for carbohydrate structure. In one study, concanavalin A (Con
                  A) lectin, a type of lectin specific to Gly/Man lectin and can be used for the recognition
                  of serum glycoprotein, was employed. This lectin was immobilized on the gold electrodes
                  through gold nanoparticles (AuNps) and polyvinyl butyral (PVB). Electrochemical impedance
                  spectroscopy (EIS) was then used to measure the electrochemical response. It was demonstrated
                  that the biosensor showed different interaction to serum glycoprotein and serum without
                  glycoprotein. The electrodes modified with serum glycoprotein demonstrated higher
                  electron transfer resistances than those modified with BSA, indicating an agglutination
                  reaction on the electrodes. The resulting biosensor detected dengue serum glycoproteins
                  from dengue-infected patients with a detection limit of 80 dilution fold [

                  as the viruses have higher electron-transfer resistance than the negative samples,
                  indicating that lectin-glycoprotein complex behaves as the unreactive electron and
                  mass-transfer blocking layer, and prevents the diffusion of ferricyanide toward the

                  of the membrane using a cross-linker. Afterward, the target DNA was deposited within
                  the same membrane. The complementary hybridization of the target DNA to its probe
                  within the pore resulted in blocking of nanopores. This blocking of pores caused the
                  impedance changes and provided detection signals. This study demonstrated that the
                  pore resistance was directly proportional to the concentration of DNA. The genosensor
                  exhibited substantial sensitivity with a detection limit of 2.7 × 10
                  <sup>−12</sup> M target DNA analyte. Additionally, this genosensor was capable of discriminating
                  the complementary target sequence from several mismatch to a single base mismatch

                  changes to produce electrical signals. The transducer used in a piezoelectric biosensor
                  is made of a piezoelectric material such as quartz and the bioreceptor is coated with
                  the piezoelectric material which resonates at a natural frequency. This frequency
                  is controlled by an external potential which produces an oscillating electric field.
                  The biorecognition event causes variation in resonance frequency resulting in current
                  changes which is detected by crystal microbalance (QCM) [

                  a better immobilization agent than glutaraldehyde and carbodiimide. The sensitivity
                  of this immunochip assay was 100-fold higher than the traditional sandwich ELISA method

                  A thin molecularly imprinted polymer specific for nonstructural protein 1, formed
                  by polymerization of monomers, was coated on QCM. These resulting artificial receptors
                  on QCM form amino-acid like cavities that can discriminate epitopes on dengue NS1

         <h2>6. Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Among the existing conventional methods, virus isolation is of limited use as it is
            laborious, expensive and requires sophisticated lab equipment. Alternatively, reverse
            transcriptase PCR could be used for the detection of dengue viral RNA during early
            stage of infection as it is rapid and sensitive technique although it needs technical
            skills and developed laboratory.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Because of this, serological-based assays are currently the most popular and widely
            used as they are comparatively cheap, sensitive, rapid and have long shelf life reagents.
            Among these serological assays, dengue NS1 ELISA is perhaps a more useful alternative
            to PCR during the acute dengue phase while dengue specific IgM ELISA remains a good
            choice during the convalescent period. Although these conventional techniques are
            very sensitive, they suffer from several drawbacks such as time-consuming, not adaptable
            to real-time detection, require skilled personnel and bulky and expensive machine.
            On the other hand, RDTs for NS1 antigen and IgM antibody detection based on immunochromatography
            are a good alternative to ELISA-based assay since they are easy to use, require no
            equipment and have very short assay time. Although RDTs can provide opportunities
            for point-of-care testing, their lack of sensitivity is a major challenge.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The development of biosensor assays may overcome the limitations of ELISA and RDTs
            since biosensor technology has sensitivity similar or higher than ELISA and with possible
            portability and miniaturization like RDTs. In addition, this technology is easy-to-use,
            inexpensive (since it requires less reagent and low energy consumption), has continuous
            monitoring, and ability to measure the target analyte in complex matrices with minimal
            sample preparation. To date, various transducers and various target analytes have
            been used during the development of sensitive, rapid and/or quantitative DENV biosensors.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">However, there is still a long way before commercialization of dengue biosensor could
            be materialized as some issues regarding clinical samples as well as the biosensor
            itself need to be resolved. The clinical samples may require additional preparation
            such as prior RNA extraction before it could be used in genosensor, making it difficult
            to adopt this type of biosensor as a point-of-care test. Meanwhile, integration of
            major biosensor components, including biosensing agent, sample pre-treatment, transducer,
            and detection method into a fully automated yet portable system is a crucial step
            towards the development of commercialized biosensor. For the diagnosis of dengue,
            biosensor could only become alternative commercial assay to conventional tests if
            it could offer rapidity and simplicity equal to RDTs while maintaining the specificity
            of ELISA.
