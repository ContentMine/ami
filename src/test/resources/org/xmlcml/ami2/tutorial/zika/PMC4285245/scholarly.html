         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We describe the kinetics of Zika virus (ZIKV) detection in serum and urine samples
            of 6 patients. Urine samples were positive for ZIKV &gt;10 days after onset of disease,
            which was a notably longer period than for serum samples. This finding supports the
            conclusion that urine samples are useful for diagnosis of ZIKV infections.

      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen (family 
         <i>Flaviviridae</i>, genus 
         <i>Flavivirus</i>) that was isolated in 1947 from a rhesus monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda (

               <a href="#R1">1</a>

         </span>). ZIKV is believed to be transmitted to humans by infected 
         <i>Aedes</i> spp. mosquitoes (

               <a href="#R4">4</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). Before 2007, few cases of human infection with ZIKV had been reported. In 2007,
         an epidemic of ZIKV infection in humans occurred in Yap, Federated States of Micronesia,
         in the Pacific region. A seroprevalence survey determined that ≤70% of the population
         had been infected (

               <a href="#R5">5</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). During 2007–2013, the few cases of infection with ZIKV reported were in travelers
         returning from Africa (

            <sup>
               <a href="#R6">6</a>

               <a href="#R7">7</a>

      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In humans, ZIKV infection is characterized by mild fever (37.8°C–38.5°C); arthralgia,
         notably of small joints of hands and feet; myalgia, headache; retroorbital pain; conjunctivitis;
         and cutaneous maculopapular rash. ZIKV infection is believed to be asymptomatic or
         mildly symptomatic in most cases (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R5">5</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). Thus, Zika can be misdiagnosed during the acute (viremic) phase because of nonspecific
         influenza-like signs and symptoms. Hemorrhagic signs have not been reported in ZIKV-infected
         patients (

         observed (

      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Biological confirmation of ZIKV infections is based mostly on detection of virus RNA
         in serum by using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Although IgM against ZIKV can
         be detected by ELISA, few laboratories have this ability. Thus, in addition to the
         nonspecific clinical features of infection with ZIKV, laboratory diagnosis is challenging
         because of low viremia and cross-reactivity of ZIKV antibodies with other flaviviruses
         (including dengue), which require confirmation by neutralization assays (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">

               <a href="#R8">8</a>
            </sup>
         </span>) and make rapid serologic confirmation difficult. We investigated the diagnostic
         utility of urine as a source for detection of ZIKV RNA by real-time RT-PCR.

         <h2>The Study</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In October 2013, a ZIKV outbreak was reported in French Polynesia (

                  <a href="#R9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). This was the second outbreak of ZIKV infection reported in the Pacific region.
            In New Caledonia, where ZIKV infection had never been documented, the first cases
            of ZIKV infection imported from French Polynesia were confirmed by the end of November,
            and the first autochthonous cases were reported by mid-January 2014. Early in February
            2014, the New Caledonia Health Authority declared an outbreak situation. By the end
            of August 2014, &gt;1,400 cases of ZIKV infection were biologically confirmed, including
            34 cases imported from French Polynesia (

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We report the suitability of urine samples for diagnosis of ZIKV infection by showing
            that ZIKV RNA is detectable in urine at a higher load and with a longer duration than
            in serum. ZIKV infection has been poorly described because it is a benign, self-limiting
            illness in most cases (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#R5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Thus, ZIKV infection has probably been underdiagnosed and underreported in disease-endemic
            settings (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#R4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) or in returning travelers. However, if perifocal vector control is to be implemented
            and severe neurologic complications are to be avoided, biological confirmation of
            ZIKV infection is essential. Because of the absence of specific IgM-based diagnostic
            tests, molecular confirmation is the only method available for routine diagnosis.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For ZIKV infection, date of onset of illness is difficult to establish because of
            sporadic and frequently mild fever. Although rash has been reported 3–5 days after
            the febrile phase (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">
               <sup>

            </span>), the 6 patients in our study had light asthenia and mild fever 2–3 days before the
            rash was observed; these symptoms were considered indicative of disease onset. Therefore,
            at the time the rash was observed, viremia was probably decreasing, which makes detection
            of virus in serum samples extremely challenging (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</span>).

               </sup>
            </span>), can be detected in urine samples for a longer time than in serum samples. Furthermore,
            use of urine samples for laboratory testing has some advantages, such as noninvasive
            sampling and ease of use. We detected ZIKV RNA in urine samples from all 6 patients.
            Urine samples showed strongly positive results; estimated maximum viral load was 0.7–220.10
            <sup>6</sup> copies/mL. For all cases with sequential specimens, ZIKV RNA was detected ≤15 days
            (range 10 days to &gt;20 days) after onset of symptoms, which was &gt;7 days after it was
            not detected in serum samples.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In our study, ZIKV was detected in patient serum until a rash was observed (days 2–3
            after disease onset). However, urine was preferred for virus detection. We observed
            a slight increase in ZIKV RNA from urine over the first few days after disease onset
            and rash (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</span>). We therefore attempted to isolate ZIKV from urine samples, but failed to cultivate
            infectious particles. Further investigations are needed to evaluate whether live infectious
            ZIKV particles are excreted in urine, as has been observed for other arboviruses (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This study investigated the diagnostic utility of urine as a source for detection
            of ZIKV RNA by real-time RT-PCR. Results suggest that urine might be useful for confirmation
            of ZIKV infection because virus was detected at higher titers and for a longer period
            in urine samples than in serum samples. Although these results need confirmation in
            larger cohorts, they strongly suggest the suitability of urine as a specimen for ZIKV
            detection and screening in large-scale investigations or other epidemiologic contexts
            (e.g., returning travelers).

            Travelers might be a source of local transmission because
