         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In 2012, a female wildlife biologist experienced fever, malaise, headache, generalized
            myalgia and arthralgia, neck stiffness, and a sore throat shortly after returning
            to the United States from a 6-week field expedition to South Sudan and Uganda. She
            was hospitalized, after which a maculopapular rash developed and became confluent.
            When the patient was discharged from the hospital on day 14, arthralgia and myalgia
            had improved, oropharynx ulcerations had healed, the rash had resolved without desquamation,
            and blood counts and hepatic enzyme levels were returning to reference levels. After
            several known suspect pathogens were ruled out as the cause of her illness, deep sequencing
            and metagenomics analysis revealed a novel paramyxovirus related to rubula-like viruses
            isolated from fruit bats.

      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Paramyxoviruses comprise a large family of viruses, including pathogens that cause
         severe disease in humans (

            <sup>
               <a href="#R1">1</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). Worldwide, &gt;100 paramyxoviruses have been identified in bats and rodents (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">
            <sup>

               <a href="#R4">4</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). Among these, few have been shown to be pathogenic to humans, possibly because of
         limited host range and/or infrequent exposure. We describe a novel rubula-like virus
         that was associated with a severe acute febrile illness in a woman. The patient was
         a wildlife biologist who had participated in a 6-week field expedition to South Sudan
         and Uganda. During this expedition, she had been exposed to bats and rodents of &gt;20
         species while wearing different levels of personal protective equipment.

         <h2>Clinical Presentation</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">During the summer of 2012, a 25-year-old female wildlife biologist participated in
            a 6-week field expedition to South Sudan and Uganda, where she traveled to remote
            rural areas collecting bats and rodents for ecologic research. In the course of her
            duties, she manipulated animals in traps and mist nets, performed dissections, collected
            blood and tissues, and visited caves with large bat populations. She received no injuries
            from sharp objects and no bites or scratches from the animals with which she was working.
            She occasionally used respiratory protection when working with animals and specimens,
            and she wore a respirator while in caves. During her trip, she had no known contact
            with ill members of the field team, no contact with health care facilities, and no
            sexual contacts. She had been vaccinated against hepatitis A and B, yellow fever,
            measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, polio, tetanus/diphtheria, and typhoid fever, and
            she fully complied with a malaria prophylaxis regimen of atovaquone/proguanil. Her
            medical history included migraines and treatment of presumptive malaria with artemether/lumefantrine
            during a similar expedition the previous year.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Five days after returning to the United States, the woman was evaluated in the emergency
            department for a 2-day history of fever, malaise, headache, generalized myalgia and
            arthralgia, neck stiffness, a metallic taste, and sore throat. Results of rapid malaria
            test, performed on the day of fever onset, were negative. Other laboratory results
            and the patient’s vital signs at the time of admission are summarized in the 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="T1">
               <a href="#T1">Table</a>
            </span>. The patient seemed to be fatigued but alert and oriented; she was anicteric, and
            she had no nuchal rigidity or focal neurologic deficits. Mild erythema of the soft
            palate without ulcerations or exudates was noted. The spleen tip was palpable despite
            absence of adenopathy.

            Initial diagnostic testing for various infectious diseases included blood screening
            for respiratory viruses, HIV, cytomegalovirus, and malaria parasites; all results
            were negative.

            H292 cells (mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells from human lungs) with patient blood and
            serum collected 3 days after symptom onset, but no virus isolate was obtained. As
            an alternative, 10 μL of the blood sample was also inoculated intracranially and intraperitoneally
            into 2-day-old suckling mice, which were then observed for 28 days for signs of illness.
            Neurologic signs developed 9–10 days after inoculation in 2 of the 20 mice; these

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Because the patient seemed to have acquired the infection during her African research
            expedition, where she had had extensive contact with rodents and bats, other persons
            who also come in contact with bats or rodents, such as field biologists, local residents,
            or ecotourists, might be at risk for infection. This potential public health threat
            prompted us to develop diagnostic assays for the rapid detection of Sosuga virus.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">First, we developed a TaqMan real-time RT-PCR selective for the 
            <i>N</i> gene and tested it on all available serum and blood samples from the patient. This
            test showed that the patient’s viremia peaked early in the course of the infection
            (cycle threshold 29.5 on day 3 after symptom onset), coinciding with the period of
            high fever and diverse irregularities in blood parameters (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="T1">
               <a href="#T1">Table</a>
            </span>). By day 9, the viremia had decreased (cycle threshold 36.3); viremia was undetectable
            11 days after symptom onset.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Second, we developed a new ELISA specific for Sosuga virus by using the virus recombinant
            nucleocapsid protein produced and purified from 
            <i>Escherichia coli</i>. This assay was tested on all available serum samples from the patient (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="T1">
               <a href="#T1">Table</a>
            </span>). Although IgG and IgM were not detectable on day 3 after symptom onset (titers &lt;50),
            seroconversion (IgG and IgM titers 
            <u>&gt;</u>1,600) occurred 11 days after symptom onset. As expected, IgM levels later decreased
            (titer 
            <u>&gt;</u>400), and IgG levels remained high 50 days after symptom onset.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In addition, the new ELISA was tested for potential cross-reactivity with some common
            paramyxoviruses, including mumps and measles viruses. No cross-reactivity was detected
            on the ELISA plates when control serum from patients with high levels of IgG against
            mumps and measles viruses was used, a desired feature in a new diagnostic assay because
            most persons have IgG to these viruses as a result of vaccination or natural infection.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A severe disease affected a wildlife biologist shortly after her return from rural
            Africa to the United States. Because of the disease characteristics (high fever and
            blood abnormalities) and travel history, a viral hemorrhagic fever was suspected,
            and clinical samples were rushed to CDC for investigation of a possible high-risk
            virus. After molecular and serologic diagnostic assays ruled out several well-known
            human pathogens (e.g., filoviruses, arenaviruses, phleboviruses, flaviviruses, and
            rickettsiae) as the cause of the patient’s illness, a next-generation sequence approach
            was followed to detect a possible new infectious agent.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The combination of next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analysis identified
            a novel paramyxovirus; the virus genome was completely characterized by use of standard
            sequencing techniques. The complete virus sequence clearly indicated a relationship
            with other rubula-like viruses isolated from bats. Moreover, the novel virus was isolated
            from acute-phase serum samples by infecting suckling mice and propagating the virus
            in cell culture. 
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The specific molecular and serologic diagnostic assays that we developed will facilitate
            rapid identification of this novel infectious agent should new cases occur. We used
            these assays to retrospectively investigate all available clinical samples from the
            patient, and the results revealed periods of viremia and seroconversion.
