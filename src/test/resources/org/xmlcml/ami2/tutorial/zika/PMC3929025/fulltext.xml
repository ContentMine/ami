Although this relationship is primarily based on studies of church attendance or prayer and wellbeing, more recent work has focused on the potential mechanisms that may mediate the religion-wellbeing findings. One of the major function of religion is finding of meaning of life and improving hope. Recent studies have indicated that hope and meaning of life are the potential variables mediate between religion and wellbeing. It was hypothesized that one pathway through which religiosity may exert its positive influence on psychological wellbeing is through finding meaning of life and improving hope. One study was conducted examining the relationships among spiritual experiences, hope, meaning of life and psychological wellbeing operationalized as satisfaction with life, positive affect and negative affect. The following research tools were used: Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale, Purpose in Life Test, Hearth Hope Index, Cantril Ladder, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Meaning of life and hope were noticed to mediate between spiritual experiences and satisfaction with life as well as between spiritual experiences and positive affect. Spiritual experiences were not related to negative affect. Both meaning of life and hope predicted negative affect. This study found meaning of life and hope to be an important factors in the religion-wellbeing relationship and related to positive psychological outcomes, including improved satisfaction with life and positive affect as well as reduced negative affect.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Religiosity</kwd><kwd>Spirituality</kwd><kwd>Hope</kwd><kwd>Meaning of life</kwd><kwd>Mediator variable</kwd><kwd>Wellbeing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The survey of the literature has revealed the researchers&#x02019; trends for searching for the variables that mediate between the religious and spiritual aspects of the functionality of an individual and his or her wellbeing (Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>; Park <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>; Zullig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2006</xref>).

(Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>; Wnuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>; Steger and Frazier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>; Zika and Chamberlain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</xref>; Vilchensky and Kravetz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</xref>; French and Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>). In the study by Steger and Frazier, conducted among the students of psychology, the meaning of life mediated between religious involvement and satisfaction with life (Steger and Frazier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>). Another study, performed among Israeli students, revealed a mediating role of the meaning of life between religious faith and psychological wellbeing or distress (Vilchensky and Kravetz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</xref>).</p><p>Among the Al-Anon group members, spiritual experiences were the source of meaning of life leading indirectly to an increase in satisfaction with life as well as to the distress level decrease (Wnuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>). A parallel study was conducted among the Alcoholics Anonymous with the application of different wellbeing indicators. The increase in the frequency of spiritual experiences was revealed to be conducive to finding the meaning of life in alcohol addicts being members of the Alcoholics Anonymous community and finally reduced the hopelessness level (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>).</p><p>Other studies proved that the relationship between the attitude toward Christianity and the sense of happiness was mediated through the meaning of life (French and Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>). The results of studies conducted on a large sample of women were ambiguous. Apart from one measure of the meaning of life, this variable mediated between religiousness and the cognitive aspect of wellbeing in the form of the satisfaction with life. The meaning of life turned out not to mediate between religiousness and emotional indicators of psychological wellbeing in the form of negative and positive affect, irrespective of which research tool had been employed (Zika and Chamberlain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</xref>). Similarly, among the Alcoholics Anonymous, the meaning of life was a variable that mediated between the religiousness indicators such as intrinsic religiousness, strength of religious faith, positive religious coping and the satisfaction with life (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>). That regularity has not been confirmed in relation to affective measures of psychological wellbeing, which seem to indicate that religiousness through the function of finding the meaning of life can influence only the cognitive components of wellbeing.</p><p>Among the entire range of approaches dealing with the meaning of life in psychology, the best known and widespread is logotheory, posed by the Viennese psychiatrist and philosopher, Victor Frankl (Auhagen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2000</xref>). Frankl&#x02019;s inspiration to articulate this therapy originates from the time spent in a concentration camp during the World War II. He noticed that in spite of severe physical deprivation, the prisoners who were able to find the meaning in the events happening to them were able to stay alive, while those who were not able to find purpose, experienced feelings of hopelessness, emptiness or senselessness, which, coupled with loss of physical vitality and stamina, led to disease and death (Frankl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1962</xref>). According to Frankl, people have a natural disposition toward developing the meaning of life, which motivates them to analyze and search for a purpose in the events in which they participate. The later research confirmed that the ability to identify a purpose is an element <italic>sine qua non</italic> of the sense of happiness (Frankl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1977</xref>). Individuals having problems with finding a purpose in their lives experience a state of &#x0201c;existential emptiness&#x0201d; characterized by feeling of boredom, anhedonia, hopelessness and the lack of motivation for engaging themselves in activity (Frankl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1973</xref>).</p><p>Psychological wellbeing is a multidimensional idea. Its cognitive aspect is satisfaction with life, while its emotional indicators are positive and negative affects (Diener <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1984</xref>).</p><p>Apart from the meaning of life, a religious-spiritual area of functionality seems to be an additional source of hope (Gibson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</xref>; Craig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</xref>; Frey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>). Among chronically ill inhabitants of rural areas, a moderately strong positive correlation has been observed between spirituality and hope (Craig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</xref>). In HIV-infected individuals, hope correlated positively with spiritual wellbeing (Abdel-Khalek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>), whereas in women with breast cancer, hope correlated with the individual awareness of inner ego and the sense of connection with the &#x0201c;Higher Power&#x0201d; (Gibson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</xref>).</p><p>Among students, hope positively correlated with life satisfaction (Abdel-Khalek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>; Chang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1988</xref>; Gilman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</xref>) and positive affect (Snyder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1998</xref>; Michael and Snyder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</xref>). The results of previous studies appear to confirm the fact that the increase in hope induced by religious-spiritual factors is manifested by better quality of life and wellbeing. Among the Alcoholics Anonymous, spiritual experiences mediated by hope were reflected by a lower level of hopelessness measured with the Beck&#x02019;s Hopelessness Scale (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>). The results of the research by Wnuk on the same population showed that hope played a mediating role between frequency of prayer and positive affect (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>). Also, among the group-supported addicts, spiritual experiences, coupled with a high level of hope, indirectly influenced satisfaction with life and a distress level (Wnuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>).</p><p>Hope has been found to be an important and valuable factor in the life of an individual. Regardless of the approach, the studies on hope highlighted its multidimensional character. Hope reflects spheres of thought, feelings, behaviors, and relationships with other people. It consists of an element of predictability; it is future oriented but rooted in the present (Stephenson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1991</xref>), and connected with the past sense of hope.</p><p>In medicine, the most frequent tool used to study hope is the Herth Hope Index. Hope is operationalized as a multidimensional, dynamic force of life, described as a certainty of achieving good, which for a hopeful individual is possible and personally important (Dufault and Martocchio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1985</xref>). According to this theory, hope is based on three main factors: the inner sense of time and future, the inner positive readiness and expectation, and the sense of connection with oneself and others. The first of them is manifested through the presence of goals, positive attitude toward the world, a conviction that every day brings a new chance, and carefree thoughts about the future. The inner positive readiness and expectation is realized through the ability to notice positive aspects, the feeling of being guided, conviction that life has meaning, and the ability to recall happy and joyful moments.</p><p>The feeling of connection with oneself and others refers both to oneself as well as to God and other people. It is realized due to the conviction of not being alone, comfort-giving faith, deep inner strength, and the ability of giving and receiving love (Herth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1992</xref>). The main hope-supporting strategies are meaningful relations with other people, the ability of carefree feeling, determination, possessing courage and serenity, clear goals, spiritual convictions (faith), the ability of recalling positive memories and respecting and accepting the individuality of others (Herth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1990</xref>).</p><p>This paper purposely integrates the religious and spiritual spheres. The terms &#x02018;spirituality&#x02019; and &#x02018;religiousness&#x02019; are usually used interchangeably, as equivalents. According to the previous studies, some aspects of spirituality and religiousness are closely connected, whereas other spiritual spheres are loosely connected or independent of religious behaviors and motives (Heintz and Baruss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2001</xref>). Nevertheless, spirituality seems to be an idea having a broader meaning than religiousness. Unlike religiousness, spirituality assumes the realization of non-religious goals, such as identity, affiliation, health, or wellbeing (Sawatzky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2005</xref>). It means that one can develop spiritually without being religious. On the other hand, spiritual experience is the crucial element of religious development (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2008</xref>).</p><p>The aim of the present work is to test the following hypotheses:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The meaning of life mediates between spiritual experiences and satisfaction with life.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The meaning of life is directly correlated with both positive and negative affect.

The introduction of the three variables to the regression equation should create the situation when the mediator variable remains the predictor of the dependent variable, whereas the previously calculated statistically significant correlation between the dependent and independent variable should be reduced to a statistically insignificant level (Baron and Kenny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1986</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Model applying mediator variable, dependent and independent variables. <italic>Source</italic>: author&#x02019;s analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10943_2012_9597_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Further analyses were carried out with the use of multiple regression analysis. For the interrelations between the variables which did not meet the first two assumptions, no further calculations were made. Finally, 4 analyses were completed. Satisfaction with life and positive affect were used as potential mediator variables in all of them; also in the regression equation, spiritual experiences were introduced as an independent variable.</p><p>When the meaning of life was introduced to the regression equation, the relation between spiritual experiences and satisfaction with life was reduced from the statistically significant level, obtained at the earlier stage of the analysis (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), to a statistically insignificant level (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.161; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.068), whereas the meaning of life continued to be a predictor of satisfaction with life (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.509; <italic>F</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37.46; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01).</p><p>When instead of satisfaction with life, positive affect was used as a dependent variable, and the correlation coefficient value of that variable and of spiritual experiences (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) was reduced to a statistically insignificant level (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.211; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.012).</p><p>Hope also turned out to be a variable mediating between spiritual experiences vs. satisfaction with life and positive affect.

Simultaneously, hope remained the predictor of satisfaction with life (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.383; <italic>F</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;18.71; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) and of positive affect (&#x003b2;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.482; <italic>F</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;34.19; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01).</p><p>Additionally, the Sobel test was applied (Bryan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>) to confirm the mediating role of hope and the meaning of life between spiritual experiences and satisfaction with life, as well as between spiritual experiences and positive affect.

According to the results of the previous research, spiritual experiences were indirectly related to satisfaction with life, and the variable mediating the relation between them was the meaning of life (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>; Wnuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>; Steger and Frazier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>; Zika and Chamberlain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</xref>).</p><p>The results of the present study have confirmed a significant role of the meaning of life as a variable mediating between religious and spiritual indicators of functionality and quality of life, regardless which tools and measures were applied to verify both these variables and how different the studied populations were. It confirms the universal character of the presented model, proving that the function of the religious-spiritual sphere of existence is the discovery of the meaning of life due to which an individual can experience wellbeing, happiness, and satisfaction with life.</p><p>The aforementioned correlations have been observed in the population of students, representatives of the Alcoholics Anonymous, and women, when both positive and negative measures of wellbeing were applied such as happiness, satisfaction with life, distress, or hopelessness. There were also numerous religious-spiritual indicators employed, comprising religious involvement through the strength of faith, religious motivation, attitude toward Christianity, positive religious coping, and spiritual experiences (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>; Wnuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>; Steger and Frazier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>; Vilchensky and Kravetz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</xref>; French and Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>). The only exception to the above-mentioned rule was the results of the study conducted among women, with the application of affective indicators of wellbeing. This study has shown that the activity of the religious-spiritual sphere was neither directly nor indirectly related to quality of life (Zika and Chamberlain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to the previous study, the meaning of life mediated between spiritual experiences and one of the two emotional indicators of wellbeing in the form of positive affect (Zika and Chamberlain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</xref>). These differences can be explained with the dissimilarities between the studied populations and different measures applied to investigate the religious-spiritual sphere. This means that the students&#x02019; spiritual experiences have the influence, through the mediating role of the meaning of life, not only on the cognitive indicators of psychological wellbeing, but also on its emotional aspects, however, only on those of a positive nature.</p><p>The results of this study have revealed that one of the crucial functions of religiousness/spirituality was the discovery of the meaning of life, which could be explained on the basis of the mechanisms of coping with stress by means of religious-spiritual values. The religious-spiritual activity through the meaning can play an important role in the process of coping with stress, in the stage of both primary and secondary assessment of the stress-generating situation. In the stage of the primary assessment, the influence of a stressor can be restricted due to finding the meaning of the events through belief that no evil can happen without God&#x02019;s allowance, or through the perception of the situation by an individual as a test of his or her faith. In the secondary stage of the assessment, an individual can reduce the negative influence of a stressful situation by discovering its meaning through acceptance, religious reattribution, due to comprehension why a specific event happened, or due to a positive reinterpretation through identification and focusing on positive implications of the event (Park <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005</xref>).</p><p>The concepts of spirituality highlight four main dimensions such as relation toward the &#x0201c;Higher Power&#x0201d;, own self, other people, and natural environment (Tse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>; Martsolf and Mickley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1998</xref>; Bloch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>; Ingersoll and Bauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>; Dyson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</xref>). According to them, the crucial element, around which spiritual functionality of individuals concentrates, is the meaning of life (Dyson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</xref>; Chiu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>; Graham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</xref>; Allen and Coy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2004</xref>; Genia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</xref>). The observed positive correlation between spiritual experiences and the meaning of life seems to prove this assumption.</p><p>A frequent feeling of coalescence with God, self-trust, a sense of integrity, identity and fellowship with others, as well as the awareness of the support of God and other people, probably allow the students to overcome their mental, biological, and social barriers. Due to it, they are able to find the meaning in their lives.</p><p>A moderate nature of the relationship between the meaning of life and all applied indicators of psychological wellbeing shows a significant role of that variable in the students&#x02019; quality of life. The methods used in this study to a considerable extent support Frankl&#x02019;s observations (Frankl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1977</xref>), which indicated that finding the meaning of life leads to happiness. Happiness is the result of an effective discovery of the meaning in various situations and events in the life of an individual.</p><p>The second hypothesis has been partially confirmed by our analyses. Similarly to the meaning of life, it was hope, which mediated between spiritual experiences and satisfaction with life, as well as between spiritual experiences and positive affect. The obtained results are concurrent with the results of studies among addicted individuals, where identical measures of wellbeing and religiousness/spirituality were used (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>). Also, the use of other indicators of wellbeing among the members of the Alcoholics Anonymous, the meaning of life turned out to be a mediating factor between spiritual experiences and the sense of hopelessness (Wnuk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>).</p><p>Our study has confirmed a significant role of religious-spiritual activity in creation of hope. It is highly probable that hope is positively influenced by the spiritual experiences manifested by the feeling of the presence of God, being the main source of joy, strength, peace and balance, feeling of God&#x02019;s help and guidance, experiencing God&#x02019;s love directly or via other persons, acceptance of other people regardless of their activities, feeling of integrity with own life, of identity with the beauty of the surrounding world, and selfless care for others. Hope, in turn, is reflected in positive goals, positive perception of the world, conviction that every day is a new chance, confidence in good future, positive thinking, feeling of guidance, appreciating the value of life, ability of recalling happy memories, belief in not being alone, faith which gives comfort, inner strength, and ability to give and receive love. The enumerated above factors decide on the students&#x02019; wellbeing, which is indicated by satisfaction with life and positive affect revealed by such emotions as excitement, inspiration, pride, positive attitude, determination, etc.</p><p>The previous studies showed that hope was the predictor of satisfaction with life (Abdel-Khalek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>; Chang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1988</xref>; Gilman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</xref>) and positive affect among the students, which confirms its crucial role in the quality of life. Another finding was that the negative correlation between the strength of hope and negative affect.</p><p>Our studies have confirmed a positive role of hope and the meaning of life in creating students&#x02019; mental wellbeing. Identified relations concerned all indicators of mental wellbeing.</p><p>According to Park&#x02019;s model, both the meaning of life and hope were found to be variables mediating the relation between religiousness/spirituality and positive indicators of psychological wellbeing in form of satisfaction with life and positive affect (Park <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>). Although the study was conducted on a transverse model, the applied methods allow to determine, with high probability, the direction of relations between the used variables (Baron and Kenny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1986</xref>). Frequent spiritual experiences promote hope and the meaning of life, the consequences of which are more frequently occurring positive emotions and satisfaction with students&#x02019; life.</p><p>Longitudinal studies could validate more the obtained relations between the above-mentioned variables by presenting them in the cause-effect perspective.</p><p>Designing a similar study among individuals experiencing a difficult situation in life such as among persons chronically ill, with the application of a greater number of religious-spiritual indicators, and a greater number and variety of measures of quality of life could give more interesting outcomes. The discovery of other sources of hope and the meaning of life, apart from religious-spiritual ones, might be employed in the designing of therapeutic activities for various groups of patients, especially for those who regard religious-spiritual values as insignificant or totally unimportant.</p><p>The inclusion of more differentiated study groups in terms of socio-demographic variables would allow to find out whether these variables are important for the relationship between religious-spiritual aspects of existence and quality of life. Such variables could modify the relations between religiousness/spirituality and quality of life. In the described project, nearly all subjects were peers, with similar education and affiliation to the same religious society, which enabled the testing of the influence of these variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The meaning of life and hope were related to both cognitive and emotional measures of psychological wellbeing, and mediated the majority of the relationships between spiritual experiences and quality of life. This is not the first study which examines the meaning of life and hope as potential pathways through which religiosity/spirituality influences quality of life and wellbeing. In the present study, this mechanism was confirmed once again with the use of specific measures of religiosity/spirituality, wellbeing and students&#x02019; population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and
