            <b>Introduction: </b>Informed, voluntary, and valid consent from biomaterial donors is a precondition for
            biobank research. Valid consent protects donors’ rights and helps maintain public
            trust in biobank research. Harmonization of consent procedures in biobank research
            is needed, because of the widely shared vision on national and international networking
            of biobanks including data and sample sharing. So far, no study has assessed and compared
            the content of current consent forms especially for biobank research. The objective
            of this study was to perform a content analysis of consent forms in German biobanks.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <b>Methods: </b>Based on ten guidelines for biomedical research, we developed an assessment matrix
            with 41 content issues that are potentially relevant for consent forms in biobank
            research. This assessment matrix was applied in a thematic text analysis to 30 consent
            documents of German biobanks identified via the German Biobank Registry in July 2012.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <b>Results: </b>Coverage of the 41 items in the assessed consent forms varied widely. For example,
            the items “Right to withdraw consent (without disadvantage),” “Policy for genetic
            information/consent to genetic analyzes” and “International cooperation/transborder
            use” were addressed in 97, 40, and 23% of all 30 consent forms respectively. The number
            of items covered by a single consent form ranged from 9 to 36 (22–88% out of 41 items).

            <b>Discussion: </b>Our findings serve as a starting point to reflect upon the spectrum of consent issues
            that must be addressed in biobank research. The findings show that the majority of
            consent forms for German biobanks, if not all, should be improved and harmonized to
            better support an informed and balanced choice of potential donors and to facilitate
            networking of biobanks. Best practice models for consent forms in biobank research
            should be developed and biobank operators need to be more aware of relevant consent
            issues.

         <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Biobanks are collections of human biological samples and related health/personal information.
            A high quality biobank that organizes samples for use by biomedical researchers is
            seen as an important resource for health research, including basic research, questions
            in personalized or stratified medicine (genetic and other biomarkers), and research
            in widespread diseases (

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The development of large-scale population-based as well as disease-specific biobanks
            also implies several new ethical, legal and social challenges. These comprise, e.g.,
            issues around the role of ethics committees, data protection, dealing with incidental
            findings, public involvement measures, and particularly regarding the need for new
            or at least modified models of informed consent of the donors (

            research settings, informed, voluntary, and valid consent is a precondition for the
            collection of samples and clinical data of donors in a biobank. It also tends to protect
            donors’ rights and autonomy and to maintain public trust in biobank research. Crucial
            points include the scope and content of consent forms, for example, how do consent
            forms address potential future research projects that might involve the donated biomaterials
            (broad/general vs. narrow/specific consent) (

            between clinician/researcher and patient/participant, they are an important component
            within the informed consent procedure and its documentation, as well as for legal
            aspects. Regarding quality and performance of consent forms in clinical or research
            contexts, several empirical studies demonstrated that consent forms are often not
            adequate in content, comprehensibility or practicability and do not meet participants’
            needs. Improvements are necessary within consent procedure and documents to support
            an adequately well-balanced and evidence-based decision-making process by participants

            that can be employed as a tool for the assessment of consent forms’ content in clinical
            or biobank research. Furthermore, we currently lack a broadly accepted “best practice”
            model for consent forms in biobank research (

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To get an overview of consent documents and templates currently used in biobank research
               in Germany, we considered all biobanks registered in the German Biobank Registry (“Deutsches
               Biobanken-Register,” 
               <div tagxxx="ext-link"></div>) in July 2012. We excluded six of the 108 registered biobanks because they were either
               doubly mentioned in the register or did not exist anymore (or their web site could
               not be accessed). Nine of the remaining 102 biobanks had consent forms publically
               available on their websites. We asked the heads of the other 93 biobanks via email
               to send us their consent documents. In this email we made clear that German biobanks
               will not be named individually in the dissemination of findings from our study. The
               response rate after repeated contact was 48% (44/90 biobanks, three mailing addresses
               were incorrect). Not all biobanks were willing to provide their consent document;
               some biobanks used a shared consent form, and two biobanks provided two documents
               for different purposes. At last, we were able to include 30 consent documents of 33
               biobanks in our analysis. If the biobanks provided additional participant information
               and a consent form, we included both documents in the analysis.

               according to standards in thematic text analysis (

                  </sup>
               </span>). All researchers were experienced in thematic text analysis and research ethics.
               The consent forms were read in full by two authors (Irene Hirschberg and Hannes Knüppel)
               independently to identify and extract text passages corresponding to each of the 41
               consent issues for biobank research. For the purpose of this study the authors only
               rated whether the items were mentioned or not. For example, the authors did not evaluate
               in depth whether these items were sufficiently comprehensible. After the independent
               text extraction and rating the researchers compared their results. Discrepancies between
               the resulting spreadsheets were identified in 114 (9.3%) of all 1,230 ratings (41
               ratings for each of the 30 consent forms). These discrepancies were discussed and
               resolved with the third author (Daniel Strech).

               German Biobank Registry in July 2012. The sample includes different types of biobank
               with varying characteristics as type (population-wide or disease-specific biobank,
               or clinical study with sample collections), number of participants, organization and
               funding, and inclusion of healthy probands or patients (e.g., inclusion of all admitted
               patients). However, all registered biobanks are considered to perform biobank research.
               The German Biobank Registry is operated by the TMF (Technology, Methods, and Infrastructure
               for Networked Medical Research) and is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education
               and Research.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Most of the biobanks had developed their own consent documents; one biobank just used
               a consent form for genetic diagnostic similar to a template of the German Society
               of Human Genetics. The consent documents (participant information and consent form)
               varied in several characteristics, e.g., in length of document (one to five pages),
               target group (patient, healthy participant, next kin, children, or parents), scope
               of consent, content, complexity and comprehensibility.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The coverage of the 41 items by the 30 consent documents was very variable. One item
               (“Right to withdraw or alter consent (without disadvantage)”) was addressed in 97%,
               another item (“Dealing with data and material after participants die or become incapacitated”)
               was not addressed by any consent form (see 
               <b>Table

                  </span>
               </b>). Though for the interpretation of the results, it has to be considered that a few
               items – as “Removal of samples after death” – are not applicable to all biobanks.
               Nevertheless, in these cases the items were counted as “not mentioned”.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A large majority of the German consent documents referred to items as in section (A)
               such as e.g., “Research explanation and purpose” (93%) and “Biomaterial: types and
               quantity of specimen” (90%), to elementary conditions in (B) such as “Free and voluntary
               participation” (80%) or “Right to withdraw or alter consent (without disadvantage)”
               (97%) and to basic aspects in section (D) such as “Confidentiality of records and
               data/extent and limits of confidentiality” (80%) and “Privacy rights and procedures/safeguards,
               data processing, and identifiability of data and samples” (90%).

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Information on some controversially discussed or partly not foreseeable items was
               given less frequently e.g., for general information (section (A)) such as “Future
               development and changes” (30%) or information on “Rights/Ownership of samples and
               data and their transfer” (57%). Also some points regarding the conditions of participation
               (section (B)) were considered by just half of the documents, e.g., “Decision on participation/withdrawal
               without affecting medical care or relationship to physician” (50%) or “Options/partial
               consent” (53%). Of the items regarding the consequences of participation (section
               (C)), the most mentioned was “Risk” (70%) and the least-mentioned “Payment/Allowance
               or additional costs” (33%). The mentioning of risks ranged from: no any mentioned
               risks at all over minimal risks for the sample/blood-taking procedure to a very detailed
               description of the risks using genetic data. (The latter refer to for example the
               knowledge as such and the related psychological burdens for the donor or family members,
               implication on re-identifiability of “anonymized” data, and potential implications
               on health insurance and employment).

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Some items of presumably high importance for biobank research (in section (D) “Dealing
               with data and biomaterial”) were mentioned infrequently, e.g., “International Cooperation/trans-border
               use” (23%), “Right of access to personal data” (17%) or “Policy on use/disclosure
               to third parties for non-research purpose” (23%).

         <h2>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This study illustrates that consent documents from 30 German biobanks differ widely
            in the range of issues that they address. Out of 41 potentially relevant issues (systematically
            identified in leading guidelines on consent in biomedical research) only three consent
            forms (10%) address more than 80% while another seven consent forms (23%) address
            less than 40%.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">One should bear in mind that the consideration of more items does not facilitate consent
            or increase its validity 
            <i>per se</i>. Nevertheless, one should have reasonable motives to minimize the extent of content
            and leave out relevant items.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">With respect to the existing heterogeneity and different types of biobanks, it has
            to be considered that not all of the mentioned items must be applicable or equally
            relevant to each biobank. Nevertheless, core criteria for consent in biobank research
            and could be harmonized on an at least abstract level. Such abstract templates could
            then be adapted to the individual national or local context. In the German sample
            it is remarkable that items with a presumably high significance for biobank research
            in general (

            use,” “Right of access to personal data” and “Policy on use/disclosure to third parties
            for non-research purpose.” The low coverage of such issues in consent forms may be
            partly because new developments in data protection law and research agendas are not
            foreseeable in detail. But it may be also because of a still limited awareness of
            legal, ethical, and practical challenges in biobank research and the need for their
            transparent communication to potential participants (

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Concerning the complexity of information, empirical studies need to assess which potentially
            relevant content issues for consent forms in biobank research can be condensed or
            simplified without minimizing the validity of the consent and the tissue donors’ understanding
            of biobank research. For a first step in this direction see Beskow (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our study has the following limitations: as a demand of further research it would
            be worthwhile to expand or modify the guidance-based assessment matrix for consent
            in biobank research in the following way: (1) to define a set of core criteria or
            balance the assessment items regarding their importance or relevance, (2) to outline
            explaining dimensions for these items, and (3) to further analyze which aspects are
            not covered sufficiently by the matrix respectively by the included guidances (e.g.,
            diagnostic/therapeutic misconception). Such conceptual and empirical research would
            provide the basis for a deeper evaluation of existing consent documents and for the
            development of new consent documents. Within our explorative study of German biobank
            consent documents we only considered whether a potentially relevant content issue
            was mentioned in a consent form at all. We evaluated neither the accuracy of the explanation
            of this issue nor its quality, comprehensibility, or readability. Furthermore, we
            did not assess criteria for supportive decision-making (e.g., IPDAS-criteria 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B26">IPDAS, 2005</a>

               </sup>
            </span>). These assessment criteria are certainly important for the development and evaluation
            of valid consent procedures as shown e.g., by (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">

               </sup>
            </span>). Another limitation arises from the fact that we could only include 32% of consent
            forms from the full sample of 102 biobanks registered in the German Biobank Registry.
            However, our sample of 30 consent forms included all leading German biobanks with
            relatively high quality standards (including all six biobanks that are part of the
            National Biobank Initiative funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and
            Research, BMBF). We suppose that the inclusion of further consent forms would not
            have changed the overall picture of the strong heterogeneity of consent forms for
            biobank research. Moreover, we would even expect a wider variation in content issues.
            Other investigations have reached similar results and support the finding that consent
            material in general, or in biomedical and biobank research in particular, needs improvement

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Taking into account the widely shared vision of national and international networking
            of biobanks and increased activities in data and sample sharing, our findings demonstrate
            the need of improvement and harmonization of consent procedures in the field of biobank
            research. Furthermore, such improvements are important to fulfil the demand of responsible
            biobank governance and to maintain public trust in biobank research (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">

               </sup>
            </span>). This does also include transparent communication on consent procedures. As described
            in the methods section only nine consent templates (8.8%) of the 102 initially identified
            biobanks were available publically on the biobanks’ web sites. Furthermore, even after
            repeated contact and the guarantee to anonymize the results for our assessment of
            consent forms only 32% of registered German biobanks were willing to provide their
            present consent form. Beside the need to improve and harmonize consent procedures,
            increased transparency of such basic information should become a major aim of German
            biobanks, to demonstrate appropriate standards of governance.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">When it comes to future improvement and harmonization of consent forms, public attitudes
            and expert opinion in relevant fields such as law, ethics, medicine, natural science
            etc. should be sought to define core criteria for consent. It may also help to overcome
            the lack of awareness of potentially relevant consent items and to address them in
            an appropriate way.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our findings serve as a starting point to reflect upon the spectrum of relevant consent
            issues in biobank research. The present study supports the systematic and transparent
            development of a “best practice” model of consent for biobank research. The findings
            show that at least the majority of consent documents in German biobanks should be
            improved and harmonized to better support an informed and balanced choice by potential
            donors and to facilitate research cooperation and networking. Further steps of such
            a best practice model would include the development of a best practice consent template
            (considering content, adherence to quality and language criteria) followed by a discussion
            and review of the template with other stakeholders (e.g., researchers, research ethics
            committees, potential biobank participants, patients’ representatives, and ethicists).
            Especially for a best practice model for consent forms, the understanding and validity
            of the text should be tested empirically (
