         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This paper describes results of a detailed literature review of the organic and inorganic
            by-products that have been identified as being formed in aqueous solution with four
            of the strong oxidizing/disinfecting agents commonly employed in drinking water treatment.
            These agents are: chlorine, chlorine dioxide, chloramine, and ozone. Significant findings
            include the production of similar nonchlorinated organic oxidation products from chlorine,
            chlorine dioxide, and ozone. In addition, all three chlorinous oxidants/disinfectants
            can produce chlorinated by-products under certain conditions. The presence of chloronitrile
            compounds in drinking waters is indicated to arise from reactions of chlorine or chloramine
            to amine/amide functions in amino acids or proteinaceous materials, followed by dehydrohalogenation.
            These nitriles could hydrolyze to produce the corresponding chloroacetic acids. It
            is concluded that to minimize the presence of oxidation by-products in drinking waters,
            the concentrations of oxidizable organic/inorganic impurities should be lowered before
            any oxidizing agent is added.
