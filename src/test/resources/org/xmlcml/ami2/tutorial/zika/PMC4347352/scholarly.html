         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Two species of 
            <i>Aedes (Stegomyia)</i> were collected in response to the first chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak on Yap
            Island: the native species 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> Farner and the introduced species 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (L.). Fourteen CHIKV-positive mosquito pools were detected. Six pools were composed
            of female 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i>, six pools were composed of female 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, one pool was composed of male 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i>, and one pool contained female specimens identified as 
            <i>Ae. (Stg.)</i> spp. Infection rates were not significantly different between female 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> and 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. The occurrence of human cases in all areas of Yap Island and the greater number
            of sites that yielded virus from 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> combined with the ubiquitous distribution of this species incriminate 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> as the most important vector of CHIKV during the outbreak. Phylogenic analysis shows
            that virus strains on Yap are members of the Asia lineage and closely related to strains
            currently circulating in the Caribbean.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the genus 
            <i>Alphavirus</i> within the family 
            <i>Togaviridae</i>.

               </sup>
            </span> The virus is endemic to Africa, India, and Asia. Phylogenetic analysis has shown
            that CHIKV form three major lineages, which represent adaption to regional conditions:
            an East, Central, South African (ECSA) lineage, a West African (WA) lineage, and an
            Asian lineage. Recently, international commerce and tourism have resulted in the introduction
            of viruses, particularly members of the ECSA and Asian lineages, into new geographic
            areas, resulting in epidemic outbreaks.

            that occurred from 1952 to 1953. Virus isolations from field-collected mosquitoes
            and experimental transmission studies established 
            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (L.) as the primary epidemic vector of CHIKV.

            <i>Ae. (Dic.) furcifer</i> (Edwards), but 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> remained the primary vector in early urban epidemics in both Africa and Asia.

            </span> The epidemic on Reunion Island was unusual, because the epidemic vector was

            E1-A226V, enhanced virus replication and transmission in

            States of Micronesia (FSM) contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
            (CDC) concerning an outbreak of unexplained illness on Yap characterized by acute
            onset of fever, arthralgia, and rash (Pastula D and Hancock WT, personal communication).
            On October 30, the Arboviral Diseases Branch (ADB) diagnostic laboratory of the Division
            of Vector-Borne Diseases (DVBD) of the CDC in Fort Collins, CO identified CHIKV in
            multiple patient serum samples sent from Yap. An entomological team from the ADB was
            dispatched in November and conducted entomological surveillance on Yap from November
            13 to 18, 2013. Goals of the entomological surveillance team were to (1) implicate
            the vector(s) based on isolation of virus from field-collected specimens and (2) determine
            the infection rate (IR) in potential vector species.

               <i>Culex (Cux.) quinquefasciatus</i> Say was the most frequently collected species, being detected at all sites except

            instances where a hospital-identified case-patient was ill but recovering, whereas
            a different family member was severely ill with symptoms consistent with CHIKV.

            </span> The Yap–British Virgin Islands clade is the sister group to a lineage including two
            viruses isolated during CHIKV activity in 2012 in Asia: one reported from the Philippines
            and one reported from a sailor in a Chinese port. This suggests that the CHIKV outbreaks
            in the Pacific and Caribbean are parts of one larger outbreak and that the virus associated
            with both outbreaks originated in Asia.
