         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In December 2013, during a Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in French Polynesia, a patient
            in Tahiti sought treatment for hematospermia, and ZIKV was isolated from his semen.
            ZIKV transmission by sexual intercourse has been previously suspected. This observation
            supports the possibility that ZIKV could be transmitted sexually.

         <i>Flaviviridae</i>, genus

         <h2>The Study</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In early December 2013, during the ZIKV outbreak, a 44-year-old man in Tahiti had
            symptoms of ZIKV infection: asthenia, low grade fever (temperature from 37.5°C to
            38°C) and arthralgia. Symptoms lasted 3 days. Eight weeks later, he described a second
            episode of symptoms compatible with ZIKV infection: temperature from 37.5°C to 38°C,
            headache on days 1–3, and wrist arthralgia on days 5–7. The patient did not seek treatment,
            thus biological samples were not collected during the first 2 periods of illness.
            The patient fully recovered from the second episode, but 2 weeks later he noted signs
            of hematospermia and sought treatment. Because the patient had experienced symptoms
            of ZIKV infection some weeks before, he was referred to our laboratory in the Institut
            Louis Malardé, Papeete, Tahiti for ZIKV infection diagnostic testing. The medical
            questionnaire revealed no signs of urinary tract infection, prostatitis, urethritis,
            or cystitis, and the patient stated that he did not had any recent physical contact
            with persons who had acute ZIKV infection. We collected blood and semen samples. Direct
            and macroscopic examinations of the semen confirmed hematospermia. We extracted RNA
            using the NucliSENS easyMAG system (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) from 200 μL
            of blood and from 500 μL of semen and urine; both were eluted by 50 μL of elution
            buffer. We used 5 μL of RNA extracted for amplification. We tested blood and semen
            RNA extracts using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) as described using
            2 primers/probe amplification sets specific for ZIKV (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#R3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). The rRT-PCR results were positive for ZIKV in semen and negative in blood, and
            confirmed by sequencing of the genomic position 858–1138 encompassing the prM/E protein
            coding regions of ZIKV. The generated sequence (GenBank accession no. KM014700) was
            identical to those previously reported at the beginning of the ZIKV outbreak (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#R3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Three days later, we collected a urine sample, then a second set of blood and semen
            samples. Semen and urine from this second collection were not found to contain traces
            of blood by both direct and macroscopic examinations. rRT-PCR detected ZIKV RNA in
            the semen and urine, but not in the blood sample.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We quantified ZIKV RNA loads using an RNA synthetic transcript standard that covers
            the region targeted by the 2 primers/probe sets. RNA loads were: 2.9 × 10
            <sup>7</sup> copies/mL and 1.1 × 10
            <sup>7</sup> copies/mL in the first and second semen samples, respectively, and 3.8 × 10
            <sup>3</sup> copies/mL in the urine sample.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We cultured semen and urine as described for dengue virus cultured from urine (

            </span>). Briefly, 200 μL of each sample diluted in 200 μL of 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) minimum
            essential medium (MEM) were inoculated onto Vero cells and incubated for 1 h at 37°C;
            inoculum was then removed and replaced by 1 mL of culture medium. We also inoculated
            a negative control (200 μL of 1% FCS-MEM) and a positive control (5 μL of a ZIKV-positive
            serum diluted in 200 μL of 1% FCS-MEM). The cells were then incubated at 37°C in 5%
            CO
            <div tagxxx="sub">2</div> for 6 days. The presence of ZIKV in the culture fluids was detected by rRT-PCR as
            described.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Replicative ZIKV particles were found in the 2 semen samples but none were detected
            in the urine sample. This finding does not exclude the possibility that ZIKV particles
            were present in urine. Positive samples were not titered.

            </span>) and potential risk for transfusion-transmitted ZIKV infections has also been demonstrated
            (

            </span>). Moreover, ZIKV transmission by sexual intercourse has been suggested by Foy et
            al. (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">
               <sup>

            </span>), who described a patient who was infected with ZIKV in southeastern Senegal in 2008.
            After returning to his home in Colorado, United States, he experienced common symptoms
            of ZIKV infection and symptoms of prostatitis. Four days later, he observed signs
            of hematospermia, and on the same day, his wife had symptoms of ZIKV infection. Because
            the wife of the patient had not traveled out of the United States during the previous
            year and had sexual intercourse with him 1 day after he returned home, transmission
            by semen was suggested. ZIKV infection of the patient and his wife was confirmed by
            serologic testing, but the presence of ZIKV in the semen of the patient was not investigated.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Infectious organisms, especially sexually transmitted microorganisms including viruses
            (human papillomavirus or herpes simplex virus), are known to be etiologic agents of

                  <a href="#R10">10</a>

            </span>) and this study, arbovirus infections in humans had not been reported to be associated
            with hematospermia, and no arboviruses had been isolated from human semen.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We detected a high ZIKV RNA load and replicative ZIKV in semen samples, but ZIKV remained
            undetectable by rRT-PCR in the blood sample collected at the same time. These results
            suggest that viral replication may have occurred in the genital tract, but we do not
            know when this replication started and how long it lasted. The fact that the patient
            had no common symptoms of ZIKV acute infection concomitantly to hematospermia suggests
            that the viremic phase occurred upstream, probably during the first or second episode
            of mild fever, headache, and arthralgia.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The detection of ZIKV in both urine and semen is consistent with the results obtained
            in a study of effects of Japanese encephalitis virus, another flavivirus, on boars.
            The virus was isolated from urine and semen of experimentally infected animals, and
            viremia developed in female boars that artificially inseminated with the infectious
            semen (

            (WNV). WNV RNA was detected in urine for a longer time and with higher RNA load than
            in plasma (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">

            </span>), suggesting that persistent shedding of WNV in urine was caused by viral replication
            in renal tissue. Dengue virus (DENV) RNA and DENV nonstructural protein 1 antigen
            were also detected in urine samples for a longer time than in blood, but infectious
            DENV has not been isolated in culture. Hirayama et al. concluded that the detection
            of DENV by rRT-PCR was useful to confirm DENV infections after the viremic phase (

            Furthermore, the observation that ZIKV RNA was detectable in urine after viremia clearance
            in blood suggests that, as found for DENV and WNV infections, urine samples can yield
            evidence ofZIKV for late diagnosis, but more investigation is needed.
