         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Infections with vector-borne pathogens are a major source of emerging diseases. The
            ability of vectors to bridge spatial and ecologic gaps between animals and humans
            increases opportunities for emergence. Small adaptations of a pathogen to a vector
            can have profound effects on the rate of transmission to humans.
         </p>
      </div>
      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases highlights the role of arthropod vectors
         in the origin and dissemination of emerging pathogens. As Woolhouse and Gaunt have
         pointed out (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R1">1</a>
            </sup>
         </span>), a substantial proportion of human pathogens are zoonotic and vector-borne, and
         they infect a substantial proportion of the world’s population. Vector-borne pathogens
         also are prominent contributors to emerging disease. There are 3 principal reasons
         for this influence.
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">First, most major classes of pathogens have evolved agents that are capable of being
         transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods: viruses (e.g., yellow fever virus, Rift Valley
         fever virus), rickettsiae (
         <i>Rickettsia rickettsii</i>, 
         <i>R. typhi</i>), bacteria (
         <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, 
         <i>Francisella tularensis</i>), protozoa (genera 
         <i>Plasmodium</i> and 
         <i>Leishmania</i>), and helminths (
         <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i>, 
         <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i>). Fungi seem to be the only category not represented.
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Second, vectors bridge barriers that would prevent transmission by direct contact
         among humans and especially between animals and humans. These barriers are not only
         spatial but behavioral and ecological. Transmission of yellow fever virus between
         arboreal monkeys and humans by mosquitoes is the classic example, but there are many
         others; transmission of 
         <i>B. burgdorferi</i>, the agent of Lyme disease, between evasive forest rodents and humans by ticks is
         just as exemplary. In such cases, direct contact between feral host and human would
         rarely take place. A corollary of this ability to bridge environments occurs when
         animals or humans move the pathogen from one vector-capable region to another. The
         introduction of West Nile virus into the United States in 1999 was a dramatic example,
         as was the recent introduction of Usutu virus to Europe from Africa in migrating birds
         (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R2">2</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). The potential for vector-borne zoonotic transmission to adapt to vector-borne human-to-human
         transmission is exemplified historically by dengue virus and 
         <i>Plasmodium</i> spp., and more recently by Zika virus (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R3">3</a>
            </sup>
         </span>) and probably 
         <i>P. knowlesi</i> (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R4">4</a>
            </sup>
         </span>).
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Third, the complexity of vector transmission offers the pathogen increased opportunities
         to evolve. In almost no instances is the arthropod simply a vessel for transmission.
         Usually, the pathogen must move from the gut to the feeding apparatus to be transmitted.
         Mechanisms range from the relatively simple, as with the plague bacillus, 
         <i>Yersinia pestis</i>, to the elaborately intricate, as with parasites in the genera 
         <i>Plasmodium</i> and 
         <i>Leishmania</i>. In these examples, the pathogen replicates in some fashion, which makes it dependent
         on an invertebrate host physiology much different from what it will encounter in its
         various vertebrate hosts. As a consequence, epidemic emergence can result from enhanced
         transmission independent of increased pathogenicity to humans. This is especially
         true of the arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that infect humans, all of which
         are RNA viruses and have high potential mutability. A notable recent example is the
         chikungunya virus epidemic that swept through the Indian Ocean region beginning in
         2006 and which is believed to have infected &gt;2 million persons. A single-nucleotide
         polymorphism (SNP) in the virus genome accelerated its replication in the relatively
         common mosquito 
         <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, usually a poorer host than 
         <i>Ae</i>. 
         <i>aegypti</i> mosquitoes (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R5">5</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). There is also evidence that an SNP enabled Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
         to jump vectors, sparking the 1993 epidemic in Mexico (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R6">6</a>
            </sup>
         </span>), and it might have been an SNP in West Nile virus that increased its virulence to
         birds and influenced the shape of the epidemic in the United States (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R7">7</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). In none of these examples was increased pathogenicity to humans an apparent seminal
         factor in the epidemics.
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Complexity of epidemiology and adaptive plasticity of pathogen and arthropod make
         the vector-borne diseases especially difficult to control, much less to eradicate.
         Vaccines are unavailable for all but a few diseases; and even when they are available,
         as for yellow fever, prevention can be difficult to achieve. The yellow fever epidemic
         that began in Uganda at the end of 2010 was the first in that country in 20 years.
         Tools for treatment are nearly as scarce. Falling behind in the race to keep up with
         developing resistance of 
         <i>P. falciparum</i> to artemisinins is a specter that haunts malariologists, and treatment for visceral
         leishmaniasis remains too expensive and complicated to be widely practiced where it
         is most needed.
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The constant development of pesticide resistance is even more worrisome than drug
         resistance because a pesticide can often be used to suppress vectors of many different
         pathogens. Even when pesticides are efficacious, their effectiveness is often compromised
         by human behavior and vector biology, as is often seen in campaigns against dengue.
         Changes in climate, land use, and transport will affect rates of pathogen emergence
         in ways we poorly understand. Fortunately, there is a growing appreciation by scientists
         and by funding agencies (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">
            <sup>
               <a href="#R8">8</a>
            </sup>
         </span>) that characterizing factors that influence pathogen and disease emergence are worthy
         goals for investigation, especially in those tropical environments where rapid change
         is most likely to incubate new pathogens.
