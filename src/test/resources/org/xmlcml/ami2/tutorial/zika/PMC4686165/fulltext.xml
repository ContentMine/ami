The work we present here analyzes the adaptive synchronization of the diapause process in the wintry generation of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>, where the egg stage is exposed to adverse winter conditions. The seasonal pattern of egg laying activity of a French Mediterranean population of the Asian tiger mosquito was monitored weekly for 2 years with ovitraps. The field diapause incidence and the critical photoperiod (CPP, i.e. the maternal day length inducing diapause in 50% of the eggs), were determined by hatching experiments on the collected eggs. The period of diapause termination was estimated by a field survey of the first hatchings for both years. The CPP is equal to 13.5 hours of light and occurs in the field on the 25<sup>th</sup> of August. Thus, it is on September 11<sup>th</sup>, 17 days after the CPP, that 50% of the eggs are in a prediapause stage in the field. The egg diapause rate increases rapidly during September, whereas the mean number of eggs laid decreases sharply after mid-September. Surprisingly, after having reached a peak of 95% at the end of September, from mid-October the diapause incidence declined and stayed below 50%. Indeed, both years the diapause initiates before the rapid decrease of the environmental temperature. This leaves a sufficient period of time to the complete development of one generation of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> with effective induction of diapause in the laid eggs. The very first larvae hatched were sampled both years in the first half of March. With 20 to 26 weeks in the egg stage and about 7 weeks in the larval stages, the first annual generation spends a long time in immature stages. On a practical point of view, this long development time represents a wide window for eggs and larvae control in early spring.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by EID M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e and the French ministry in charge of health, Direction G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;rale de la Sant&#x000e9; (DGS).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Asian tiger mosquito <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (Skuse 1894) is an invasive species, extending its distribution range faster than any mosquito species during the last 30 years [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Native to South-East Asia, the first efficient establishment of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> in a temperate country outside its native area was recorded in Albania in 1979 [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 1985 it started to invade the United States of America from Japan [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and in 1990 Western Europe, especially Mediterranean areas, from the United States [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In both cases the species was imported as dormant eggs through used tires trade [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The vector competence of the Asian tiger mosquito was demonstrated for 27 arboviruses, but its role in field outbreaks was only proved for dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The risk of emergence or re-emergence of these diseases is relevant with regards to the European outbreak history. The most explosive and virulent dengue outbreak was recorded in 1927&#x02013;28 in Greece, and was transmitted by another urban and anthropophilic vector, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is a topic of high concern with autochthonous cases of dengue fever reported in France repeatedly since 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and in Croatia in 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> is responsible for a chikungunya outbreak in Italy in 2007 [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as for indigenous transmissions in France in 2010 [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However detailed field data on its phenology are still lacking, and particularly on the incidence of winter dormancy, to better understand its seasonal dynamics. These data are needed to assess the risk of mosquito-borne diseases transmission and to develop adequate vector control strategies in temperate areas.</p><p>The Asian tiger mosquito shows a remarkable ecological and physiological plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The environmental parameters of importance to define this species suitable habitat have been identified [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as well as the epidemiological hazard [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In temperate areas, winter temperature is the major factor limiting the persistence of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Temperate populations are able to withstand winter at the stage of egg diapause [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Diapause is a process of arrested development of the organism occurring before environmental conditions become harsh, permitting the optimal temporal adaptation of the species to its environment [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The seasonal dynamics of the diapause process is of prime importance to decipher its phenology. The terms and definitions of the diapause phases used here refer to the review of Ko&#x00161;t&#x000e1;l [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The facultative egg diapause is induced by maternal photoperiod [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Females are sensitive to short photoperiod at pupal and adult stages. They then produce a signal to trigger diapause preparation in their oocytes. Diapause initiation is effective once the embryo is fully developed [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The prediapause phase includes all events from diapause induction to diapause initiation. The diapause phase ends by the diapause termination, as the gradual reactivation of the eggs after winter. In many insects, the major environmental factors in diapause termination are low temperatures and an extended photoperiod [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Eggs will stay in a post-diapause quiescence after the diapause termination up until they experience a springtime hatching stimulus. As winter temperatures in Southern France are a strong constraint for the survival of this species, the invasive populations probably underwent a strong selection pressure. The adaptation of the photoperiodic induction of diapause in a particular area is known to happen quickly in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus we expect that <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> populations from the French Riviera are able to respond to the local photoperiodic conditions through a maternally induced diapause allowing them to avoid temporal harsh conditions.</p><p>The work presented here attempts to analyze the complete diapause process of the wintry generation of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>, from events occurring during their maternal oogenesis to the oviposition of their offspring. For this purpose, we isolated and quantified the effects of photoperiod on diapause incidence in a natural population. (1) Using individuals sampled in the field, we determined the critical photoperiod (CPP) of the population, i.e. the day/night ratio that the laying females must be exposed in order to induce diapause in 50% of the eggs laid. The CPP was compared to the field diapause incidence. (2) The period of dormancy termination was then estimated by a field monitoring of the first hatchings on both years. (3) Lastly, using a day degree model, the egg laying activity data of 2 consecutive sliding years were analyzed according to the phenology of diapause and climatic conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethic statement</title><p>The animal facility of the &#x02018;&#x02018;Entente Interd&#x000e9;partementale pour la D&#x000e9;moustication du littoral m&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;en&#x0201d; has received accreditation from the French Ministry of Agriculture to perform experiments on live guinea pig (permit number B34-172-29) in appliance of the French and European regulations on care and protection of Laboratory Animals.

Eggs of F2 generation were stimulated to hatch under standardized conditions, and larvae were reared in batches of 250 larvae per pan of 1 liter tap water and fed with 1.75 g of milled dog food. Eleven days after egg hatching, pans containing fourth instar larvae with first pupae were transferred in cages in photoperiodic chambers. Three batches of larvae were used per photoperiodic conditions, as follows: 13:11, 13.25:10.75, 13.5:10.5, 13.75:10.25 and 14:10 L:D hours. Photoperiodic chambers consisted of windowless plastic boxes (65 x 65 x 40 cm) with a black-tissue zipper opening.

Consequently, from the generic day of diapause initiation to the date of observation of the first larva hatching, there was 424.85 ADD during the winter 2010&#x02013;2011 and 615.5 ADD during the winter 2011&#x02013;2012.

In 2012 such low temperatures ended a week before the observation of the first larva. Only 2 days of chilling with T<sub>mean</sub> &#x02264; 5&#x000b0;C were encountered in both winters. These winters differed little in their average temperature: the 2010&#x02013;2011 winter was 1.3&#x000b0;C colder than the 2011&#x02013;2012 winter, with respectively 73 days versus 38 days under an average temperature of 10&#x000b0;C.

However when looking at the cumulated thermal degree units available for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>, both winters differed a lot. Indeed, the 2011&#x02013;2012 winter had 45% more ADD than the winter 2010&#x02013;2011. As the first annual larvae appeared quite simultaneously both years despite different winter meteorological conditions, other factors may be involved.

From egg hatching to the first oviposition, the development time measured in 2011 in the field corresponded closely to the heat units necessary (245 ADD). However in 2012, only 201 ADD were observed between the monitored hatching and egg laying; a correspondence in ADD measured is observed when considering the time where the number of eggs laid reached 5% of the annual weekly mean number of eggs laid.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec021"><title>Diapause induction</title><p>The CPP is under polygenic control, evolving with latitude [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and is a very plastic life history trait sensitive to high temperature [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and larval nutritive state [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The observed difference in the field of 0.8 hour between the CPP and the diapause preparation into 50% of the eggs is important and could be partly explained by environmental conditions. Indeed, individuals of the natural population are exposed to fluctuating temperatures, which can slightly interact with the photoperiodic signal. In the northern tamarisk beetle <italic>Diorhabda carinulata</italic>, high daily thermal amplitude was demonstrated to reduce the CPP by 0.15 hour for laboratory controlled amplitude of 10&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This kind of effect could exist in <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>, however the median daily thermal amplitude did not reach 6.7&#x000b0;C during the month preceding and following the day of CPP. Furthermore, the effects of thermal amplitude in the field should be counterbalanced by the broad variability of larval nutrition; indeed, adults starved at larval stages showed a CPP lengthened up to 0.25 hour [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The different temperature and food conditions experienced by individuals do not entirely explain the difference in photoperiodic responses between the field and the laboratory populations. The photothermic analysis of the prediapause stage suggested diapause was not completely induced in eggs of the first gonotrophic cycle in the field. Indeed, there was enough ADD during this time for sensitive stages to develop from the pupae to the end of the second gonotrophic cycle (<xref rid="pone.0145311.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This supposition is corroborated by laboratory experiment at 21&#x000b0;C on this strain, showing a switch to complete induction of diapause in eggs of females exposed to short photoperiod during at least 11 days (<xref rid="pone.0145311.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). A similar observation was made on North America strains [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus diapause induction should only be considered fully effective for eggs from the second gonotrophic cycle. As a physiological process, diapause induction could occur slightly faster in the field where mean temperatures are higher by 1 to 3&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0145311.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>).</p><p>Egg diapause must be induced at the appropriate time to obtain an initiation accurately synchronized with seasonal conditions. In the field, the maximum diapause incidence occurred a month before the cooling of the minimal temperature under 15&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="pone.0145311.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). After diapause induction it is essential that the environment remains sufficiently warm to allow for the completion of at least one full generation of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> progenitors and of a diapausing offspring [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The sum of heat units recorded both years in our field study allowed the complete development of one, and sometimes two generations of progenitors. Does it mean the CPP of this Asian tiger mosquito population is not perfectly adapted to the local Mediterranean environment? Even though it is not possible to assert this with certainty, the data are consistent with a &#x0201c;bang-bang&#x0201d; strategy [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]: during the favorable period mosquitoes reproduce and do not enter diapause, up to a specific date, illustrated as the CPP, when all the organisms will have to initiate diapause. The apparent precocity of prediapause stage could then be explained by the overlapping generations of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> and the stochasticity of rainfalls occurrence or intensity during Mediterranean summers.</p><p>Most of the population enters diapause at the end of September, however a decrease of the diapause incidence is observed in eggs laid after that date on both years. This trend is not directly induced by the photoperiod, as the diapause incidence of our local temperate populations in the laboratory remains higher than 90% for rearing day lengths of 13.0 as well as 9.0 hours [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As diapausing eggs are not sensitive to environmental stimuli, only non-diapausing eggs can hatch to produce a new generation of breeders at the end of the season. Thus the overall decrease in the number of active <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> at end of the season&#x02013;decrease caused by the initiation of diapause&#x02013;leads to a selection of phenotypes that express less or no diapause in the remaining active population. Under favorable climatic conditions this selection phenomenon allows for a rapid decline of diapause in the population, such as documented in previous studies: In Rome, Italy, the minimum egg hatching rate obtained after a field sampling of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> eggs realized in the fall of year 2000 was 17%&#x02014;as compared to less than 5% in our study&#x02013;meaning that a significant part of the <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> population had not entered diapause [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In southernest's cities of Spain, a small part of the Asian tiger mosquito population is probably unable of winter diapause [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This phenomenon is even more evident in North America where a progressive selection of the non-diapausing phenotypes could explain that in 2011 more than 60% of eggs laid by the strain of Miami are not in diapause [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The non-diapausing individuals must be advantaged in areas with warm winters, having the exclusive benefit of a longer period of time for reproduction and proliferation.</p><p>In metropolitan France, non-diapausing phenotypes are probably eliminated afterwards by winter conditions. Indeed, in our study the complete end of the egg laying period occurred at the same time as the most important rainfalls of the year (<xref rid="pone.0145311.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). These exceptional rainfall events occurring on week 44 may have precipitated the end of the active season of the Asian tiger mosquito by causing an important mortality of the immature stages [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and remaining adults. However, a continuous residual egg laying activity was observed during the winter in Rome [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and in southern Spain [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but none was reported in other southern cities, such as Athens, Greece [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] or Tirana, Albania [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] where the oldest European populations of the Asian tiger mosquito are found. In Rome (41&#x000b0;53&#x02032;N), despite repeated flooding during winter the eggs remained unhatched, thus confirming their diapause status and leading to the strong assumption that they had been laid by long-lived <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> females of the last seasonal generation [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The anthropogenic modification of the environment is likely to be involved in the winter survival of mosquitoes [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However in France, based on a 6 years long population sampling&#x02014;winter monitoring included -, the persistence of adult <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> populations during winter seems unlikely to happen soon [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Dormancy termination</title><p>The beginning of diapause termination in the field was estimated in our study by a monitoring of egg hatching, although this method cannot discriminate the termination <italic>per se</italic> of the post-diapause quiescence. This quiescence follows diapause termination until environmental conditions become favorable. The monitored breeding sites were flooded and maintained with water by the investigator, therefore only eventual low temperatures would have sustained quiescence and have substantially delayed egg hatching. Based on our study, and according to previous field observations [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and models [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the values for the hatching onset parameters correspond to a spring temperature above 10.5&#x000b0;C and a spring photoperiod above 11.25 hours. The termination of diapause leads to a gradual reactivation of eggs in the field. The factors involved in this process where studied in laboratory and differed with regards to the mosquito species [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Mainly, a long-term exposition at chilling but not freezing temperature triggers egg reactivation. Photoperiodism is also effective, long day treatment having a strong reactivation effect in eggs of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>caspius</italic> and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>triseriatus</italic>. The adaptive advantage of photothermic interaction is obvious in the field, photoperiodism preventing early and inappropriate hatchings under changing temperatures during winter. Our data are consistent&#x02013;but not conclusive&#x02013;with a reactivation dependent of a photothermic interaction. The estimation of the average minimum temperature of the week preceding egg laying activity found in this study is inferior by 0.5&#x000b0;C from the 13&#x000b0;C found in northern Italy on adult female emergence [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. As some precocious egg laying and adults were observed in 2012, earlier undetected hatchings could explain this discrepancy between monitored and development time. However, there occurrence resulted more likely from an accelerated larval development in breeding sites warmer than field conditions, such as rain barrels exposed to the sun.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>The long generation</title><p>Maternal induced egg diapause plays a central role for the wintry long generation, with phases studied here in a field population: from the induction through to the diapause initiation, and following up to diapause termination (<xref rid="pone.0145311.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The first annual generation spends a long time in immature stages, with 20 to 26 weeks at the egg stage and about 7 weeks at the larval stages. This long development time represents for mosquito control operators a great opportunity to thwart the species population dynamics by targeting the eggs and larvae of a unique generation. The mechanical suppression of breeding containers where eggs have accumulated as a result of female seasonal oviposition choice during the fall [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] would be an especially efficient procedure for that purpose. As mosquito control operators cannot contact every inhabitants living in the suburban areas where the major biting discomfort is experienced, the main issue to overcome, particularly in a period with no adult nuisance, will deal with communication aiming to modify community habits [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0145311.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145311.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Schematic depiction of the seasonal activity and diapause process of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> population in the Mediterranean city of Cagnes-sur-Mer, France.</title><p>Horizontal lines represent the mean durations of diapause syndrome and of the long generation of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic>.

[<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the time span of mosquito activity measured in our study is already longer than projections for the current period [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and even equal to projections for 2030&#x02013;2050 [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In these models, the Mediterranean area is expected to be very vulnerable to climatic change, with a strong overall warming&#x02013;including a temperature increase of 2&#x02013;4&#x000b0;C during fall and winter up to the years 2071&#x02013;2100 &#x02013;and a reduction in precipitation [<xref rid="pone.0145311.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].
