These four islands have a combined surface area of 100.4 km<sup>2</sup> and are approximately 25 km long and 10 km wide at their widest point.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The four main islands of Yap are the remnants of old, metamorphic, high volcanic islands, with a current maximum elevation of 174 m. The climate of Yap is characterized by constant warm temperatures, heavy rainfall, and high humidity. Mean annual rainfall is 3,028 mm. The driest months are February, March, and April, with an average monthly precipitation of less than 180 mm.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The wettest season is July through October, when average monthly rainfall is 330 mm.

Mean relative humidity ranges from 79% to 85%.</p><p>The tropical island vegetation of Yap has been modified by agricultural practices. The main crops are taro, coconut, breadfruit, yams, bananas, tapioca, citrus, and betel nut. Livestock, including chickens and swine, are maintained by many residents.

Collections were made at 14 sites: 12 suspect case-patient residences and 2 sites not associated with human disease; 11 of 12 suspect case-patient residences were single or extended family homes, whereas the remaining case-patient residence was located in an apartment complex (site 14). A list of names and residences for patients clinically diagnosed as having a recent or ongoing CHIKV infection by staff of the Yap State Hospital was provided to the entomological team. At each home, the entomological team verified that the patient resided at the residence and then obtained permission to collect mosquitoes. The 12 suspect case-patients residences were located in three municipalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>): 4 residences in Gagil (sites 10&#x02013;13), 2 residences in Tomil (sites 2 and 14), and 6 residences in Rull (sites 4&#x02013;9). In addition, collections were made at two sites not associated with human disease: the Division of Public Safety (Police Department and jail), which is site 3 and located in Colonia (Weloy), and the Tomil Community Health Center (site 1).</p><p>Adult mosquito collections were made at all 14 sites with 1 to 2 BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure and octenol (BioQuip, Rancho Dominguez, CA). Traps were run for 24 hours, and collection bags were changed each morning. At selected sites (sites 4, 6&#x02013;9, 11, and 13), adult mosquitoes were also collected with a large aspirator (InsectaZooka; BioQuip). Aspirator collections were brief (5&#x02013;20 minutes) and focused on resting sites in and around case-patient houses.</p><p>Collection bags from BG traps and aspirator cups were labeled each morning, placed on gel packs in a cooler, and returned to the field laboratory. Mosquitoes were removed from other taxa and debris with the aid of a dissecting microscope and placed in labeled cryotubes. Specimens in cryotubes were maintained on Yap at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C and shipped on frozen gel packs to Guam, where they were transferred to a &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C ultra-low freezer. On Guam, cryotubes were repackaged and shipped on dry ice to the CDC in Fort Collins, CO.</p><p>In addition, 16 mosquito ovitraps (black plastic cups) were placed at four sites on Yap.

A 125-&#x003bc;L aliquot of the supernatant of each pool was removed and placed in an identically labeled Eppendorf tube for RNA extraction and testing with a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (see below). On the same day, six-well plates (Corning, Corning, NY) containing a monolayer of Vero cells were inoculated with 250 &#x003bc;L mosquito pool homogenate filtered through a 0.20-&#x003bc;M syringe filter (Pall, Port Washington, NY) and placed into an incubator set at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The cell and homogenized mosquito mixture were then monitored daily for cytopathic effect (CPE) for 7 days. Media from those wells presenting signs of CPE were harvested and placed at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To test samples with a second methodology and detect low-titered samples, we also screened an aliquot of each mosquito pool for viral RNA using a real-time RT-PCR assay similar to that described previously,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> except with the use of a new primer/probe set (3855/3957c/3886 FAM) designed to detect Asian and ECSA genotypes of CHIKV (Lanciotti RS, personal communication).

Primer 3957c and probe 3886 FAM are produced by first reconstituting the individual a and b primers to 100 &#x003bc;M and the individual a and b probes to 25 &#x003bc;M and then mixing a and b in equal volumes to produce the mixed working stocks. Viral RNA was extracted from a 100-&#x003bc;L aliquot of supernatant taken from each mosquito pool using the Qiagen QIAamp Virus BioRobot 9604 Kit (Qiagen) on a Qiagen BioRobot Universal platform according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time RT-PCR was used to screen for CHIKV by adding 10 &#x003bc;L of each extracted RNA to 50 pmol primers and 10 pmol probes specific to the non-structural (nsP2) region of the CHIKV genome as described above and reagents from Qiagen's Quantitect Probe RT-PCR Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.

(Stg.)</italic>: <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is an African species, and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is an Asian species. Both species are successful colonizers and presently display greatly expanded distributions because of human commerce.</p><p>We detected two species of <italic>Ae. (Stg.)</italic> on Yap: the introduced species <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and the native species <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic>. <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was not present in our collections or those of three previous surveys (Savage HM and Godsey M, unpublished data).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> is one of the most abundant species on Yap and common in all areas of the island, except the port area (Savage HM and Godsey M, unpublished data).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Larvae of this species occur in both natural and manmade habitats throughout the island,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> including coconut shells and husks, which are common in natural areas and very abundant around homes, where coconut is consumed as a principal food item and coconut husks are stored to make fiber and use as firewood. In contrast, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> apparently did not successfully colonize Yap during World War II<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and was first detected but rare in 1995 during a survey associated with an outbreak of dengue-4 virus.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Currently, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> has a patchy distribution on Yap island, being common in Colonia, the port area, and nearby dense residential areas of northern Rull and less common in other parts of the island; however, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is occasionally present in rural communities, where piped drinking water is not available and/or 55-gallon barrels are abundant (Savage HM and Godsey M, unpublished data).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The only other species of <italic>Ae.

Six pools were composed entirely of female <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic>, and one pool was composed of four male <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> specimens. Six positive pools were composed entirely of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). One virus-positive pool contained two badly damaged specimens that were identified as <italic>Ae. (Stg.)</italic> spp. IRs for all female specimens of <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). Virus-positive pools were detected at 5 of 14 sampled sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Four sites were suspect case-patient residences, and one site, site 3, was the Police Department and jail located in central Colonia. Five of six (83%) <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> isolates came from a single productive case-patient residence, and three of six positive <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> pools were composed of engorged specimens. Virus-positive mosquitoes were collected on multiple (2&#x02013;4) days at three of four case-patient residences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Detection of virus on multiple days at case-patient residences and in engorged specimens is indicative of continued transmission at these case-patients' homes. Bed nets were provided to hospitalized patients to limit transmission within the wards; however, bed nets and insect repellents were rare in homes and in very limited supply for outpatients from the hospital, making transmission from viremic outpatients to other residents of virus-positive homes likely. Although the entomological team did not attempt to document continued transmission within a household, we did observe instances where a hospital-identified case-patient was ill but recovering, whereas a different family member was severely ill with symptoms consistent with CHIKV.</p><p>The data from case-patient residence site 9, where five of six <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-positive pools were identified and no <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> were collected, show that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is an efficient vector as expected. However, the greater number of sites that yielded virus in <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> and the much wider distribution and greater abundance of <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> on Yap suggest that <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> was a more important vector on Yap than <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. The epidemiological data also support this contention. Human CHIKV cases were reported from all municipalities on Yap, indicating that the vector had a wide distribution, and the highest attack rate was observed in Gagil (Pastula D and Hancock WT, personal communication), a rural municipality where <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> is abundant and <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is limited in distribution. Virus-positive pools of <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> were also detected at the jail in central Colonia (site 3) and a residential property in the surrounding urbanized area (site 7), two sites where the ecology and larvae habitats should have been associated with greater <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> abundance.</p><p>Concurrent with the CHIKV outbreak on Yap, human suspect case-patients were also reported from four islands of Yap State: Fais, Eauripik, Ulithi Atoll, and Ifalik Atoll (Pastula D and Hancock WT, personal communication). Although entomological surveillance was not conducted on these islands during the CHIKV outbreak of 2013, previous entomological surveys documented that <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> was very common and that <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were both absent on Fais (Aure F, unpublished data), Eauripik,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and Ulithi and Ifalik Atolls.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Previous studies have implicated <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> as an epidemic vector of dengue viruses on Yap and Palau based on distribution, abundance, and positive association with risk factors for human disease, despite the absence of virus isolations from field-collected specimens.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Similarly, <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> was implicated as an epidemic vector of Zika virus on Yap in 2007 based on abundance and distribution without the support of virus isolations from field-collected specimens.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This report is the first time that <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> has been incriminated as a vector based on multiple virus isolates from field-collected specimens. Recently, laboratory studies have provided additional support for the vector status of <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> for both CHIKV and Zika virus and weaker support for its role in dengue virus transmission.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Our detection of CHIKV in one pool composed of four male <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> was surprising. Previous vector competence experiments and testing of field-collected specimens have provided mixed results, with most studies reporting the absence of vertical transmission<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> but others supporting its occurrence.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Recent experimental work with <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> indicates that vertical transmission of CHIKV is rare and limited to the progeny of older females, because Bellini and others<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> detected virus-positive progeny at low rates (4.3 per 1,000) and only in progeny of the second gonotropic cycle. The epidemiological significance of vertical transmission is uncertain but coupled with venereal transmission, which has been shown in the laboratory for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and CHIKV,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> offers a possible secondary mechanism of virus maintenance in the vector.</p><p>The sequences for the virus isolates from mosquitoes and humans from Yap are very similar, and all are members of the Asia clade of CHIKV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The Yap strains are most closely related to a human isolate from the British Virgin Islands.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The Yap&#x02013;British Virgin Islands clade is the sister group to a lineage including two viruses isolated during CHIKV activity in 2012 in Asia: one reported from the Philippines and one reported from a sailor in a Chinese port. This suggests that the CHIKV outbreaks in the Pacific and Caribbean are parts of one larger outbreak and that the virus associated with both outbreaks originated in Asia.</p><p>Incrimination of <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> as an epidemic vector of CHIKV in Yap based on multiple virus isolations from field-collected specimens combined with the established vector status of <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> suggest that other members of the Scutellaris group of <italic>Ae. (Stg.)</italic> could also serve as vectors of CHIKV, including species occurring on remote islands, where the traditional epidemic vectors <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are absent or limited in distribution. The implication of a number of species of the Scutellaris group as epidemic vectors of dengue viruses<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and the implication of <italic>Ae. hensilli</italic> as an epidemic vector of Zika virus on Yap<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> further show the ability of Scutellaris group mosquitoes to vector a variety of viruses in different families. However, CHIKV has been isolated from mosquitoes in several subgenera of <italic>Aedes</italic> as well as the genus <italic>Mansonia</italic>,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and additional taxa may play a role in the transmission of CHIKV as it is introduced and becomes established in new geographic regions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We greatly appreciate the loan of four BG traps from Laurent Gillaumot (Pasteur Institute of New Caledonia, Noumea, New Caledonia), which allowed us to initiate collections before our equipment arrived.
