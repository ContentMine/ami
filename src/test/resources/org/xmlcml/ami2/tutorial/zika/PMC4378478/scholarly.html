         for acute febrile illness, was initiated in Cebu City, Philippines (I. Yoon, unpub.
         data). Participants contacted study staff to report fever and were also contacted
         weekly by staff to determine if they had fever during the previous 7 days. Fever episodes
         triggered an acute-illness visit by a study nurse, who performed a clinical assessment
         of the patient and collected an acute-phase blood sample. During the first year of
         surveillance, 270 acute febrile illnesses were detected; 267 of the patients had samples
         available for serologic testing for evidence of influenza, dengue, chikungunya, Japanese
         encephalitis, and Zika virus infections.

      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In May 2012, a 15-year-old boy in Cebu City reported a subjective fever; an acute-illness
         investigation followed. Other symptoms included headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat,
         myalgias, stomach pain, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, but no rash. The boy did not
         seek medical care or require hospitalization; his only treatment was acetaminophen.
         He had no recent travel history, and no other members of his household were ill. The
         boy recovered fully by the 3-week study follow-up visit. An acute-phase blood sample,
         collected 2 days after symptom onset, was negative for dengue and chikungunya viruses
         by reverse transcription PCR. An in-house dengue/Japanese encephalitis IgM/IgG capture
         ELISA and chikungunya ELISA were used to test paired acute- and convalescent-phase
         blood samples; all results were negative. ZIKV ELISA was not available at the testing
         laboratory. However, by using real-time reverse transcription PCR targeting the gene
         that encodes the precursor of membrane protein, we detected ZIKV RNA in the patient’s
         serum sample (

         <i>Toxorhynchites splendens</i> mosquitoes and by inoculating C6/36 cells with patient serum. The MiSeq platform
         (Illumina, Hayward, CA, USA) was used to obtain sequence reads by next-generation
         genomic sequencing, which identified a 789-bp contig as a partial sequence of the
         ZIKV gene that encodes the nonstructural 5 protein (GenBank accession no. KM851038).

         Polynesia. The virus has a high potential for ongoing geographic expansion into countries
         where 
         <i>Aedes</i> spp. mosquitoes are present and are known to transmit ZIKV; most notable among these
         vectors are

         infection has been reported in a child in Cambodia, and serologic evidence of ZIKV
         infection has been reported in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines
         (

      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Phylogenetic analysis of the isolate from our study indicated that it is more closely
         related to the strain from Micronesia that was responsible for the 2007 Yap outbreak
         than to strains identified in Cambodia (2010), Thailand (2013), or French Polynesia
         (2013). It is possible that the ZIKV infection in our study was an isolated case (the
         virus was confirmed in only 1/270 episodes of acute febrile illness). However, because
         the symptoms of disease are similar to those for other known endemic arboviruses,
         it is also possible that the strain was introduced into the Philippines before 2012
         and remained undetected.
      </p>
      <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The spectrum of ZIKV-associated clinical disease remains uncertain. Although reports
         indicate most cases of infection are mild, infections may be associated with more
         severe disease outcomes, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome (
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">

               <a href="#R10">10</a>
            </sup>
         </span>). Increased surveillance for ZIKV disease, using pan-flavivirus or ZIKV-specific
         molecular testing, may lead to more frequent identification of cases, which could
         give a clearer indication of the true number of ZIKV infections. Additional surveillance
         and research studies are needed to improve our understanding of this disease, including
         the potential epidemiologic and clinical effects of ZIKV co-circulation with other
         flaviviruses.
