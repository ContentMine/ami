This is because arboviruses cause symptoms that are similar to more common infections and because there is a geographical overlap in the arbovirus infections that people have a large chance of being infected with. We compared the amount of times that Dutch physicians had patients tested for arboviral infections with the likelihood that Dutch travelers would be exposed to particular arboviruses. Whereas research and diagnostics generally focus on only one virus, our study was uniquely comprehensive and systematic in that it analyzed multiple viruses simultaneously on the basis of a unique national database. The research shows that the current viruses travelers are tested for is incomplete and likely many more people carry these kinds of diseases than are diagnosed. As these diseases pose potential public health threats, physicians should be more aware of the diseases that travelers could be infected with, and protocols are needed regarding what infectious diseases physicians should check for when patients present with particular symptoms.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data from diagnostic patient database are available with restriction due to ethical guidelines of using patient information.

Due to their vector-borne and often zoonotic nature, they require targeted surveillance and control schemes. This requirement is particularly relevant when evaluating symptoms of illness in travelers. Of all those returning from developing, tropical, or subtropical countries, 8% require medical care on return.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] For those returning from Africa and Southeast Asia, fever is the most common reason for seeking medical care; for travelers returning from the Caribbean and South America, rash is the most common reason. Around 50% of the cases remain undiagnosed in clinics focused on travel medicine, and this percentage is likely higher in less specialized clinics.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The traveler&#x02019;s personal physician is therefore an important link in ongoing arbovirus surveillance in travelers and the gate-keepers of disease detection.</p><p>Correct diagnosis of arbovirus infections in travelers is challenging. Arboviruses have overlapping geographical distributions and cause symptoms that coincide with more common infections.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] If general practitioners consider an arbovirus infection in their differential diagnosis, they commonly test for the best known arboviral disease, Dengue virus (DENV). Laboratory diagnostics for travelers are largely based on serologic testing, since viremia is short-lived and has often already dropped to undetectable levels when severe symptoms appear and diagnostics are performed.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The use of serologic results for arbovirus diagnosis and surveillance requires careful evaluation due to cross-reactivity of antibodies to related viruses.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Also, several vaccines, notably for Yellow fever, Tick-borne encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis, can cause false-positive serological tests.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>For these reasons, arbovirus illness is under-diagnosed, as evidenced by studies of unexplained illness in returned travelers.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A potential solution would be the development of syndromic arboviral disease detection methods that cover the most common arboviruses and simultaneously provide surveillance information.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Here we aimed to assess the potential added value of syndrome-based approaches for diagnosis and surveillance of neglected arboviral diseases in returning Dutch travelers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>To map the patients high at risk of missed clinical arboviral infections in returned Dutch travelers, we compared the quantity and quality of all arboviral diagnostic requests by Dutch physicians, from 2009 through 2013, with a previously extensive literature-based assessment of travelers&#x02019; likely infection with an arbovirus.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The overlapping syndromes and geography, based on and updated from that review are depicted in <xref rid="pntd.0004073.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pntd.0004073.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0004073.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Geographical distribution of medically important arboviruses that cause febrile disease in humans.</title><p>All arboviruses cause febrile symptoms, but symptoms more specific to certain viruses are represented in three columns: 1) Arthralgia-Rash (AR); 2) Neurological symptoms (NS), and 3) Hemorrhagic symptoms (HS).

When comparing the numbers of requests and proportions of positives by region of travel, substantial differences were observed: diagnostic requests for ill travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa were frequent but not often positive, whereas ill travelers returning from popular arbovirus-endemic regions in Central and Western Asia were rarely tested. A low number of patients who had traveled within Europe were tested. DENV was tested (N = 41) almost as often as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (N = 57), for which exposure is far more likely. Of note, two of these European travelers tested DENV-positive. One was a tourist returning from Croatia, who tested DENV-IgM-positive and borderline NS1-positive. The other tourist had taken a five-day trip to Southern France and was DENV IgM- and NS1-positive 10 days after return. However, 14 days previous to onset of symptoms, this traveler had been in Thailand before traveling on to France. Another virus considered endemic to Europe is Sindbis virus (SINV), for which diagnostics are not readily available in the Netherlands. Nor are they available for oropouche virus (OROV), endemic to South America.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Syndromes reported</title><p>To assess the potential use of diagnostic requests for syndrome surveillance by region, we analyzed the symptoms recorded for each patient returning from a particular travel destination.

Both DENV and CHIKV were positively associated with travel history to Southeast Asia.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we assessed the extent of missed arboviral infections in travelers by a retrospective database analysis of all arboviral diagnostic requests in the Netherlands, from 2009&#x02013;2013, in comparison with a literature-based assessment of arbovirus exposure while traveling (<xref rid="pntd.0004073.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). We found clear evidence for patient groups high at risk of being under-diagnosed for arboviral disease when evaluated by syndrome and by region. While DENV diagnostics are routinely requested, other relevant arboviruses are neglected, in particular CHIKV. Arthralgia, for example, is not only associated with DENV infections but also with many arboviruses, including CHIKV, as we found when calculating odds ratios within the current Dutch data.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Nevertheless, less than 55% of patients with symptoms compatible with CHIKV infection were tested (<xref rid="pntd.0004073.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a&#x02013;4c</xref>). Interestingly, hemorrhagic symptoms and rash have a much higher odds ratio than arthralgia-arthritis for diagnosing DENV. Although arthralgia is an important symptom in dengue patients, rash and fever are often more pronounced.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In the case CHIKV arthralgia-arthritis is more pronounced and is known to have a higher predictive value for distinguishing CHIKV from DENV in endemic settings.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Additionally, CHIKV is less well known by physicians in non-endemic countries so might be only considered if DENV diagnostics are negative.</p><p>The analysis of diagnostic requests by region showed a bias toward the more well-known arboviral risk areas such as Southeast Asia (Figs <xref rid="pntd.0004073.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0004073.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For travelers within Europe, arbovirus diagnostics are rarely requested, despite high incidence rates of TBEV reported across Europe and continuing circulation of WNV in parts of Europe popular with Dutch tourists.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This is a general trend also seen in previous reports on travel associated infection presenting in Europe.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Housing type and location during travel is an import risk factor for exposure to specific vectors,[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and outdoor camping is popular among travelers in Europe.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The number of CHIKV and DENV requests within Europe was almost equivalent to the number of TBEV and WNV test requests, while only a small number of CHIKV and DENV have been reported.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The low number of TBEV and WNV requests may reflect a lack of physician awareness of European arboviruses and their risk to travelers; it may also reflect financial restrictions or limited time.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Our analysis showed that physicians were more likely to extend the diagnostic panel for patients with more severe or very specific symptoms. For instance, diagnostics for WNV and Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) were usually requested only for patients with neurological complaints, even though fever is the most common clinical presentation in &#x0003e;90% of WNV and WEEV patients.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Similarly, RVFV diagnostic requests were limited to patients with hemorrhagic symptoms (HS) and neurological symptoms (NS), although these severe symptoms occur in less than 1% of cases, and most patients present only with febrile symptoms (<xref rid="pntd.0004073.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a&#x02013;4c</xref>).[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] This bias toward severe symptoms was likewise reflected by the finding that patients referred to large hospitals and travel clinics were more extensively evaluated than those visiting small hospitals and local clinics. Reasons for this difference were not assessed in our study but are likely related to the fact that 1) general practitioners often omit arbovirus diagnostics, due in part to budgetary constraints; 2) they may lack knowledge on arboviral disease, and 3) may believe that an arbovirus diagnosis is unlikely to influence their treatment decisions, particularly if symptoms are mild. However, even mild arbovirus infections can eventually cause severe or chronic symptoms like arthralgia and, in any case, they pose a potential risk to health workers. Lack of proper diagnosis may lead to unnecessary complications or extensive later testing of patients. A possible solution to this problem is diagnostic centers providing syndromic and region based diagnostic packages for travelers as presented by the algorithms here.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] These can be continuously updated in collaboration with specialized physicians and Public Health professionals. This will relieve the general physicians from keeping up to date on such a complex and continuously changing area. At the same time physicians are provided with a complete diagnostic selection and data are more suitable for use in surveillance.</p><p>Our results show a large variation in the timing of first diagnostic sampling. In our study, 50% of travelers contacted a healthcare provider during the first week of illness. This means that 50% did not, and viremic patients may introduce viruses into a region, when appropriate vectors are available, [<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or pose a risk for nosocomial infection.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Only 1.3% of all diagnostic tests performed were molecular, while 50% of patients fell within the range advised for molecular testing. The timeframe for molecular and serological diagnostics overlap to a great extent. Within the first days of illness, however, serology has a low sensitivity.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] A number of the DENV cases may have been secondary, tertiary or quaternary infections. This reduces the sensitivity of serological detection by IgM in non-primary infections significantly.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Many patients are therefore probably missed due to lack of molecular testing within this timeframe. To use diagnostic data for syndromic surveillance, a two-tiered approach could be employed. First, samples collected after three days of illness onset would provide syndromic information by multiplex serologic testing. Second, if testing showed increased circulation of a target virus, confirmation and genomic surveillance would follow in patients suspected to harbor that virus sampled within seven days of illness.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this study. Nearly all patients tested for arboviral diseases in the five-year-period in the Netherlands were included. This group, however, only consists of patients that seek medical attention after travel and that are suspected of an arboviral infection by a clinician. Asymptomatic patients and patients where clinicians did not consider an arboviral disease are missed. Almost all patients lack vaccination history. Patients with recent yellow fever vaccinations could cause positive false positive serological tests.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Lack in reporting vaccination history and the resulting possible flavivirus cross-reactivity due to vaccination are known problems when using flavivirus serological diagnostic data.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Both diagnostic centers had extensively validated tests internally with yellow fever vaccines and changed diagnostic cut-offs provided by manufacturer to compensate if possible. However, false positive tests due to vaccination cannot be excluded.</p><p>Infectious disease diagnostics and surveillance of travelers is primarily focused on those cases or diagnostic outcomes selected and reported by physicians.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Although this approach provides essential information, many patients remain undiagnosed, and re-evaluation of the selected pathogens has been advised.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] However, much knowledge on probable arbovirus exposure of travelers is based on information originating from the destination country, which may have limited surveillance and diagnostic capabilities. In some of these countries, large-scale surveillance projects using a more syndromic approach to infectious diseases have shown extensive under-diagnosis and under-recognition of the importance of many arbovirus diseases as a cause of common syndromes.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] This underlines the need, in the Netherlands and other affluent countries, for more systematic syndrome-based diagnosis and surveillance in travelers to these regions. It demonstrates the added value of using routine travel information to support national and international surveillance programs. For such surveillance, capturing only a fraction of all cases may still provide reliable information on disease trends and possibly local outbreaks, provided the selection is systematic.[<xref rid="pntd.0004073.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It is also important in terms of preparedness for emerging infectious diseases.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A physician&#x02019;s diagnostic requests for returned travelers can play a key role in infectious disease surveillance. However, while travel destination and syndrome could be used for triage and diagnostics, such use is inconsistent. We found clear evidence of patient groups at risk of under-diagnosis of arboviral disease when evaluated by syndrome and by region.</p><p>Based on a comparison between all arboviral diagnostic requests by physicians in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2013 with a literature-based assessment of the likely exposure of the patients to an arbovirus, we showed that while dengue virus diagnostics are routinely requested, other relevant arboviruses such as chikungunya virus are neglected, even if travelers present with relevant symptoms and return from countries where the viruses are endemic. We also showed that for travelers to European destinations, arbovirus diagnostics were rarely requested and that for almost all arboviruses and travel destinations, diagnostics were requested only when patients presented with severe symptoms.</p><p>Whether the low number of requests and overemphasis of physicians on patients presenting with severe symptoms reflects a lack of physician awareness of arboviruses and their risk to travelers, financial restrictions or limited time, it points at possible gaps in preparedness. Our paper shows that in order to limit the amount of missed clinical arboviral infections, and to increase the level of awareness of arboviral infections of public health significance, physicians should rely on diagnostics and surveillance with a syndromic approach and matching laboratory methods.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0004073.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Higgs</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>Impact of climate change and other factors on emerging arbovirus diseases</article-title>. <source>Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</source>. <year>2009</year>;<volume>103</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>109</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>21</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.07.025">10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.07.025</ext-link></comment><?supplied-pmid 18799177?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18799177</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pntd.0004073.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>LH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name>. <article-title>Dengue and chikungunya infections in travelers</article-title>. <source>Curr Opin Infect Dis</source>. <year>2010</year>;<volume>23</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>438</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>44</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/QCO.0b013e32833c1d16">10.1097/QCO.0b013e32833c1d16</ext-link></comment>
