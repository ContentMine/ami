Symptoms are often non-specific hence the need for an early, sensitive and specific diagnosis of dengue for appropriate management as well as for early epidemic detection. Currently, almost all laboratory diagnostic methods require a blood specimen that may be sometimes be difficult or inconvenient to obtain. In this study, we assessed the possibility to use saliva and urine samples as alternatives to blood specimens in dengue diagnosis. We demonstrated that the performances of the different diagnostic methods (RT-PCR, NS1 antigen detection and anti-DENV IgM/IgG/IgA ELISAs) were in general not as good in saliva and urine as in plasma, but that the use of these body fluids obtained by non-invasive methods could be of value in certain circumstances such as outbreak investigations or in young children (once they are old enough to comply to instructions), in addition to the situations when blood cannot be easily collected (e.g., lack of phlebotomist, refusal of the procedure, etc.).</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007/2011) under Grant Agreement n&#x000b0;282 378.

Until recently, four serologically related but antigenically and genetically distinct dengue viruses (DENV-1, -2, -3,and -4) causing disease in human were known, but a fifth serotype was recently discovered in Malaysia [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Over the last decades, DENV has become the most important arthropod-borne virus affecting humans. Several factors such as rapid urbanization, failure to control mosquitoes and rapid progress in air transportation have contributed to the emergence of endemic dengue in 128 countries in the world [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 2.5 billion people were living in areas at high risk for infection, among which 50 million were infected annually [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However due to weak disease surveillance, low level of reporting of cases and difficulties in diagnosis, the true incidence and burden of dengue are very likely under estimated. Using new modeling approaches, Bhatt et al. estimated that approximately 3.97 billion people were living in areas where DENV is circulating and that almost 400 million cases of dengue occurred every year worldwide [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>While most infections are asymptomatic or result in a mild febrile illness, the virus is capable of producing life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome, and non-specific complication of systemic diseases (e.g. encephalitis, hepatitis) [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The course of dengue illness can be divided in three main phases: the febrile phase, the critical phase and the recovery phase. Severe clinical disease manifestations such as fluid leakage, bleeding and shock occurs during the critical phase which begins around day 4&#x02013;7 after the onset of fever, when the temperature drops under 38&#x000b0;C, and lasts usually between 48 to 72 hours. During the critical phase, the condition of patients experiencing a severe form of the disease worsens as a result of plasma leakage whereas the condition of patients with a non-severe disease improves.</p><p>Direct diagnosis of DENV infection is based on virus isolation, detection of the viral genome by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or detection of NS1 antigen. Indirect diagnosis using serological methods to detect anti-DENV IgM and IgG is commonly employed, while IgA tests remain less commonly used. The selection of diagnostic methods depends greatly on the time-point of the sample collection during the course of the disease. RT-PCR and virus isolation require a blood sample collected during the early febrile phase of the disease (0&#x02013;5 days after the onset of fever) [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A sample obtained during the early phase is also preferred for NS1 detection, but in patients experiencing a primary infection the NS1 antigen remains detectable for nine days or more after the onset of fever [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Serological methods can be used later during the course of the disease. IgM and IgA, however, can persist in blood during several weeks or even months after the infection while IgG may persist for decades. Differentiating between an acute and a recent DENV infection by these methods may therefore be challenging. Currently almost all laboratory diagnostic methods require a blood sample that may be difficult to obtain in children, the population which is most commonly affected by dengue in endemic regions, especially in field conditions or outbreak settings. Saliva and urine samples could be used as surrogates for blood as the collection of these body fluids is non-invasive and better accepted by patients, does not require medically-trained staff and the samples are easier to process as they require only limited laboratory facilities.</p><p>Diagnosis using urine and saliva samples has already been explored for several other viral infections such as HIV, Hepatitis A, B and C and rubella [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Urine specimens seem suitable for the diagnosis of infection by West-Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)&#x02013;two other flaviviruses&#x02014;as viral genome of both viruses can be detected longer in urine than in serum [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and infectious WNV and ZIKV can be recovered from urine [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Previous studies conducted on a limited number of samples have demonstrated that urine and saliva could be used as an alternative to blood for serological or virological diagnosis of dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to describe the excretion profiles of the anti-DENV antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA), the NS1 antigen, the viral genome and of the infectious virus in plasma, saliva and urine specimens obtained from a large number of Cambodian children with a confirmed dengue infection. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the possibility of using saliva and urine as alternatives to serum or plasma samples. We also aimed to assess if urine and/or saliva specimens could contribute to predict progression towards a severe form of the disease, as suggested by Chuansumrit <italic>et al</italic>.

Samples were prospectively obtained from children hospitalized with clinically-suspected dengue in one of the three hospitals of the Kampong Cham province participating to the DENFREE study. Dengue infection was confirmed in patients through a combination of: viral RNA detection by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR); isolation of the virus in cell culture; detection of the NS1 protein in the blood; by evidencing a IgM seroconversion in paired plasma and/or a fourfold increase of the antibody titer measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) in paired plasma collected at least seven days apart. Disease severity was assessed for each patient according to the 1997 WHO criteria and to the 2009 WHO guidelines [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] using clinical, biological and paraclinical examination data recorded at admission and throughout the entire hospitalization period. Patients were classified into 2 groups: non-severe dengue (dengue fever (DF) according to the 1997 guidelines and DF without warning signs according to the 2009 WHO guidelines) and severe dengue (dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and DSS (dengue shock syndrome) according to the 1997 guidelines and dengue with warning signs as well as severe dengue according to the 2009 WHO recommendations). Urine and saliva were collected daily during hospitalization and then one week, two weeks, three weeks, one month and three months after the discharge from hospital. Plasma specimens were collected at three time-points during hospitalization: on admission, during hospitalization and at the time of hospital discharge. If the patient or guardians gave consent, blood was also collected 30 and 90 days after leaving the hospital.</p><p>Urine specimens were collected in 50 ml sterile tubes. Due to the large volume of saliva required for the analyses, the saliva specimens were obtained by direct spitting into 1.8 ml sterile tubes. If possible, children were asked to spit into two separate tubes, an empty one and a pre-filled one with 100&#x000b5;l of viral transport medium (VTM), until minimal volumes of 100 &#x000b5;l and 200 &#x000b5;l were reached in the empty and the pre-filled tubes, respectively. All clinical samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C prior to testing. In addition to prevent degradation of the RNA and of the virus infectivity, the freezing process was also beneficial to reduce the viscosity of the saliva.</p><p>Only patients with well-documented medical records allowing a clear assessment of the disease severity were included in this study.</p><p>The clinical specimens obtained from 20 patients hospitalized for a non-dengue febrile illness were also used to assess the specificity of the different diagnostic methods in urine and saliva samples. These controls showed no biological evidences of on-going DENV infection (DENV qRT-PCR negative, NS1 test negative and no anti-DENV antibodies in paired plasma [admission and discharge]).</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Viral genome detection</title><p>The viral RNA was extracted from 140 &#x000b5;l of plasma, 280 &#x000b5;l of saliva mixed with VTM and 280 &#x000b5;l of concentrated urine, using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Urine samples were concentrated using the 100K Microsep ultrafiltration device (Pall, USA) to convert an initial volume of 5 ml urine to a final volume of 280 &#x000b5;l of concentrated urine. After extraction, the DENV nucleic acids present in plasma were detected by a serotype-specific quantitative multiplexed real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as previously described by Hue <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For urine and saliva, the multiplex qRT-PCR was replaced by a monoplex qRT-PCR as the serotype was already identified in the corresponding plasma. Results were expressed in equivalents to complementary DNA (cDNA) copies per ml. The limit of detection in plasma was 350 copies/ml for DENV-1, 75 copies/ml for DENV-2, 350 copies/ml for DENV-3 and 715 copies/ml for DENV-4. The limit of detection was 200 copies/ml, 50 copies/ml, 200 copies/ml and 350 copies/ml for DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively, with the qRT-PCR in urine and plasma specimens spiked with quantified synthetic plasmids.</p><p>As DENV viremia lasts only a few days after the onset of fever (DAOF), the samples selected for the detection of the viral genome were mainly those collected during hospitalization. Additional urine and saliva specimens collected one to three weeks after discharge from the hospital were also added as some data previously published suggested that the DENV genome could be detected in urine until day 16 after the onset of fever [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Virus isolation in C6/36 cells</title><p>C6/36 cells were used in attempt to isolate DENV from urine and saliva samples.

Saliva diluted in VTM as well as urine samples were diluted 1/2 with L15 Leibovitz Medium (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) containing 2% of fetal calf serum (Gibco Life Technology, USA).

Briefly, in the one-step ELISA developed for NS1 detection in saliva, the sample and the conjugated antibody were incubated together for 2 hours. In the two-step ELISAs (used for plasma and urine specimens), samples were first incubated for one hour and then after a washing step, the conjugated antibody was added and incubated for one hour.</p><p>For the patients infected with DENV-1, the NS1 protein was quantified by ELISA using serial two-fold serial dilutions of a solution containing a known concentration of affinity-purified DENV-1 recombinant NS1 protein expressed in HEK293T cells (kindly provided by Dr. Marie Flamand, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). The standard curve was linear between 0.5 ng/ml and 16 ng/ml for all three NS1 assays. A result was considered positive if the OD was greater than twice the mean OD value measured in 20 negative controls (20 healthy children enrolled during the community study of DENFREE project).</p><p>Two positive controls, a weak one and a strong one, and one negative control were used to validate the results of each plate.

A significance was assigned at P&#x0003c;0.05 for all parameters and were two-sided. The statistical differences between various categorical groups were detected using Chi-squared test. Correlation coefficients between two continuous variables were calculated using Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation test. Uncertainty was expressed by 95% confidence intervals (CI95).</p><p>In order to identify explanatory variables associated with the detection of the viral genome, the NS1 antigen or the anti-DENV antibodies in the three different fluids, multivariate analysis using a boosted regression tree (BRT) approach was used. BRT is a method combining regression trees with weak individual predictive performances into a single model with higher performance. We used BRT because it is capable of dealing with complex responses, including non-linear relationships and interactions between explanatory variables [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and we were expecting such complex relationships between our explanatory and response variables. As part of the final model, the BRT assesses the relative importance (RI) of each explanatory variable based on the number of times a variable is used in all trees and its contribution to the final model improvement. A higher RI of a predictor indicates a stronger influence on the response in question (i.e. the detection of each diagnostic marker, in this study). The effect of each explanatory variable on the response can be visualized by the use of partial dependence plots. For each model with a binary response variable, a Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated. The AUC ranges between 0.5 for random prediction to 1, the higher the AUC the better the model performance. For models with a continuous response variable, the performance of the model was estimated by a correlation coefficient between observed and predicted datasets. This correlation coefficient ranges between 0 (no correlation) and 1 (perfect correlation), with values superior to 0.5 suggesting a high correlation. The analysis was carried out using the &#x0201c;dismo&#x0201d; package (version 1.0&#x02013;5) [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and the &#x0201c;gbm&#x0201d; package (version 2.1) [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] under the R statistical environment (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). A learning rate of 0.001, a bag fraction of 0.5 and a tree complexity of 3 were used. The explanatory variables used are summarized in <xref rid="pntd.0004100.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

At the latest time-points, the proportion of urine samples positive by qRT-PCR was approximately the same as the proportion of RNA-positive plasma specimens (71.4% and 62.5% at DAOF 9&#x02013;10, respectively). DENV RNA remained detectable in one urine sample at DAOF 16. The detection rate of viral RNA by qRT-PCR in saliva samples followed the decreasing curve of the RNA detection rate observed in the plasma specimens. The highest proportion of saliva samples that tested positive for DENV RNA was observed between the first day and the 4<sup>th</sup> day of fever (60.5% at DAOF 0&#x02013;2, 63.9% at DAOF 3 and 58.5% at DAOF 4) whereas plasma samples collected at the same time-points were RNA-positive in 96% to 100% of the cases.

Both models were built with the explanatory variables &#x0201c;daof&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;classif&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;igg&#x0201d;. In both models the higher RI was obtained for the variable &#x0201c;igg&#x0201d; (RI = 85.2% and 77.3% for the NS1 and the viral RNA models, respectively), followed by the variable &#x0201c;daof&#x0201d; (RI = 8.5% and 20.9% for the NS1 and the viral RNA models, respectively) and the variable &#x0201c;classif&#x0201d; (RI = 6.3% and 1.8% for the NS1 and viral RNA models, respectively) (<xref rid="pntd.0004100.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Table</xref>). The partial dependence plot analysis demonstrated that higher NS1 concentrations and RNA loads were associated with very low level of anti-DENV IgG (OD&#x0003c;0.15) (<xref rid="pntd.0004100.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><p>One of the objectives of this study was to assess the possibility to use saliva or urine specimens instead of blood for the diagnosis of dengue infections in specific situations. The evaluation included the assays most routinely used for dengue diagnosis: viral genome detection by qRT-PCR, virus isolation in mosquito cell lines, NS1 antigen and anti-DENV antibody detection by ELISA methods. In order to generate the strongest data possible, a large number of samples obtained from children hospitalized in Cambodia for dengue of varying degrees of severity were tested. This is the first study in which plasma, urine and saliva obtained from the same patients, at the same time-points, were tested in parallel and the results compared to estimate the performances of the various dengue diagnostic assays.</p><p>Saliva and urine specimens are obtained through non-invasive procedures that require the patient&#x02019;s participation. If devices for urine sampling in infants exist and if saliva can be collected with small specific swabs, one may consider that in the youngest children the collection of capillary blood on filter paper after a finger-prick could be a better alternative to venipuncture than urine or saliva sampling.</p><p>This is the first study that aimed to detect the DENV genome in such a large number of saliva samples and to comprehensively describe the kinetics of DENV genome detection in this body fluid. Previously, Anders <italic>et al</italic>. attempted to detect the DENV genome in saliva swab specimens obtained from six patients with confirmed DENV infection but all samples tested negative [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The DENV genome was successfully detected from saliva samples in only few instances and described in some cases reports [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as well as in one very recent study performed on only 14 patients [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We demonstrated here that, as in the plasma, the sensitivity of the genome detection in saliva specimens was the highest during the early acute phase of the infection (i.e., 63.9% at day 3 post-fever; approximately 60% during the four first days of the disease) and then decreased over time before the RNA became undetectable 10 days after the onset of fever. The curves of the sensitivity of the RNA detection in plasma and saliva specimens had very similar profiles over time. Nevertheless, the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR in saliva was on average 40% lower than in plasma when the specimens were tested between DAOF0 and DAOF8. The BRT analysis indicated that the higher the RNA load in plasma, the higher the probability of detecting the viral RNA in saliva samples was.</p><p>Some authors showed in a limited number of patients and samples that the DENV genome could be detected in urine specimens [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Hirayama <italic>et al</italic>. described the results obtained with 77 urine samples collected from 53 patients and described DENV genome excretion kinetics similar to the one we report here, i.e. a delayed excretion of the viral genome in urine by comparison to blood [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In some cases, the DENV genome was still detectable in urine samples while the serum already turned negative by qRT-PCR [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In our study, we observed this pattern in three patients whose plasma collected at the time of hospital discharge (up to10 days after onset of fever) tested negative, whereas their urine collected at the same time was positive. The sensitivity of the confirmation of the dengue infection by viral genome detection improved from 79.6% to 82.6% when qRT-PCR was performed in both urine and plasma samples collected after the 5<sup>th</sup> day of fever, compared to qRT-PCR in plasma alone. Nevertheless, even after DAOF 5, plasma remained the best biological fluid to use for dengue diagnosis. Indeed, out of the 116 pairs of urine and plasma samples collected during the early convalescent phase of the disease from the same patients, 63.8% were concordant (i.e., both urine and plasma samples tested positive or both urine and plasma samples tested negative). Only three pairs demonstrated discordant results with an advantage for urine over plasma whereas 39 pairs gave discordant results in favor of plasma (i.e. the urine sample tested negative whereas the corresponding plasma sample tested positive). After discharge from the hospital, the urine sample of three other patients still tested positive (two patients at DAOF 13 and one patient at DAOF 16) but the comparison with plasma was not possible as blood samples were unavailable for these time points. All patients whose saliva samples tested positive also had detectable levels of RNA in the plasma samples collected at the same time-points. Thus, testing saliva in addition to the plasma samples did not significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity. When it is not possible to get blood samples, testing concurrently both urine and saliva specimens by qRT-PCR could offer an interesting alternative as the overall diagnostic sensitivity was 76.1% during the acute phase of the disease (DAOF 0&#x02013;5) and 59.4% during the early convalescent phase (DAOF 6&#x02013;12). Alternatively, the analysis of sequential urine or saliva specimens could also provide, in specific situations, some acceptable results as 57% of the patients had at least one positive urine sample and almost 69% of them had a least one saliva sample that tested positive in the course of the disease.</p><p>To date, DENV has never been isolated from urine or saliva. Two unsuccessful attempts to isolate the DENV from urine and one attempt to isolate the virus from saliva were previously reported by Hirayama <italic>et al</italic>. and Korhonen <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The low RNA loads in urine and saliva observed in our study could provide one explanation to the inability to isolate the virus after inoculation of the samples onto C6/36 or Vero E6 cells [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Nevertheless, the absence of infectious DENV particles from urine and saliva specimens will be attested only after unsuccessful inoculation of the RNA-positive samples into mosquitoes, as this method is recognized as the most sensitive for DENV isolation [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Direct toxicity on C6/36 or Vero E6 cells of some urine and saliva components could also explain the inability to isolate the virus from those samples. In our study, urine samples were dialyzed before inoculation in order to eliminate potentially toxic components and saliva samples were inoculated after dilution with culture media to avoid excessive direct toxicity. Furthermore, the controls included in the series of culture plates provided evidence that a premature cell death was not responsible for the absence of virus detection. It rather appeared that a low viral load was at the origin of an absence of detection of infectious virus in saliva and urine specimens. But it is also possible that the DENV RNA detected by qRT-PCR in urine was &#x0201c;free&#x0201d; viral RNA that was able to go through the glomeruli while virus particles, especially those embedded in large immune complexes, were stopped.</p><p>The detection of NS1 protein in saliva and/or urine samples has already been reported in three studies bearing on a limited number of patients [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and recently in a larger study including urine samples from 96 patients [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate that the sensitivity of NS1 detection in saliva and urine samples follow a similar trend over time. Diagnostic sensitivity increased progressively until DAOF 4 to reach a maximum of 25% in urine and 40% in saliva samples, and then decreased until NS1 became undetectable, ten days after fever onset. The sensitivity NS1 antigen detection in urine and saliva samples observed in our study was lower than the one reported previously. Anders <italic>et al</italic>. reported 64.7% (55/85) of saliva samples positive for NS1 protein when testing patients with a positive NS1 antigenemia [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our study, only 25.8% (99/383) of the paired plasma and saliva samples tested both positive, at the same time-point. Chuansumrit <italic>et al</italic>., Korhonen <italic>et al</italic>. and Saito <italic>et al</italic>. previously evaluated the sensitivity of NS1 detection in urine using the same commercial ELISA kit. Chuansumrit <italic>et al</italic>. and Korhonen <italic>et al</italic> reported sensitivities of 65.6% and 54.2%, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Saito <italic>et al</italic>. described a positive detection rate of NS1 ranging from 13% to 43% according to days after disease onset. The highest detection rate was obtained on days 6&#x02013;10 after disease onset [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As observed for the RNA load, NS1 protein concentrations measured in urine and saliva samples were much lower than those measured in plasma specimens. The multivariate analysis using BRT identified the NS1 concentration in plasma as the main factor explaining the possibility of detecting the viral protein in urine and saliva. Korhonen <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that the NS1 concentration in urine positively correlated with the concentration in urine of the total proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In their study, Chuansumrit <italic>et al</italic> reported a higher NS1 detection rate in urine samples obtained from patients with DHF than in patients presenting with a mild DF [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Our statistical analysis performed in a large patient series did not evidence a higher probability of detecting NS1 in the urine of patients experiencing a severe form of the disease (DHF and DSS) than in those presenting with a mild infection. We decided not to concentrate urine specimens before testing for NS1 in order to keep the ELISA protocol as easy and cheap as possible to meet the &#x0201c;real-life&#x0201d; conditions of most endemic countries which are also often developing countries. Saito <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the benefit of urine concentration prior to NS1 capture by ELISA with 37 paired concentrated and non-concentrated urine samples. Concentration allowed the detection of NS1 antigen in three samples that tested negative before concentration [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. For well-equipped laboratories that may be willing to use urine as a replacement to blood for DENV infection confirmation, it would be important to further develop of a fast and simple method for NS1 protein concentration.</p><p>Our study also shows that 2/3 of the plasma samples that tested positive by qRT-PCR also tested positive for NS1 detection; that half of the saliva samples that tested positive by qRT-PCR also tested positive by NS1 capture ELISA, but that NS1 was detected in less than 30% of the urine samples that tested positive by qRT-PCR. The discrepancy between the RNA and NS1 detection in urine samples obtained from patients with detectable viremia suggests that these two biological markers of dengue infection are potentially released in urine through different mechanisms that remain to be clarified.</p><p>Similarly to Vasquez <italic>et al</italic>., we were unable to detect anti-DENV IgM in urine specimens [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The sensitivity of the IgM and the IgG assays in saliva was close to those obtained in plasma samples. The sensitivity of the IgA serology in both urine and saliva was 65% at the peak point when it was almost 90% in plasma. This is in agreement with the data previously described by Vasquez <italic>et al</italic>. as well as by Balmaseda <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the probability of detecting antibodies in saliva specimens depended essentially on antibodies titers in the plasma. Cuzzubbo <italic>et al</italic>. reported previously that salivary IgG levels correlated well with serum HI titer [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This study also showed that IgG detection in saliva could be used to distinguish between primary and secondary DENV infection. Our BRT analysis confirms this result. Balmaseda <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the use of IgG and IgM detection in saliva to evaluate DENV infection incidence during a serological survey and demonstrated that anti-DENV IgG detection in saliva was a good tool to measure the incidence of dengue in a community cohort [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The anti-DENV IgG antibody urinary excretion curve follows the same trend than that of IgG in plasma during the first week of the disease. Subsequently, urinary excretion of IgG decreases over time while it remains stable in plasma. Three months after disease onset, 76.1% of the patients had detectable anti-DENV IgG in their plasma whereas only 12.5% of them still tested positive in their urine. The present study is the first to document the kinetics of anti-DENV antibodies until the third month after fever onset. Multivariate analysis showed that the detection of anti-DENV IgG in urine was not primarily associated with antibody titers in plasma but with the immune status of the patient and with the time of sampling after the onset of the disease. Antibodies are high-molecular-weight (HMW) proteins. In physiologic conditions, these proteins are almost completely restricted from filtration by the glomerular barrier and only a very small quantity of it can normally be detected in urine. The presence of macromolecules such as IgG and IgA in urine could reflect an alteration of the glomerular barrier, with or without tubular cells impairment. IgM is a pentameric immunoglobulin of very high molecular weight (950 kDa) and its detection in urine would reflect a severe glomerular injury [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This probably explains why IgM were not detected in the patients included in this study as none of them had any record of severe renal impairment during the course of their illness.</p><p>In this study, as in most of those reported previously, saliva specimens were collected by direct spitting. Only Anders <italic>et al</italic>. collected saliva using swabs and reported results significantly different from ours [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These authors were unable to detect DENV genome by RT-PCR but obtained a higher sensitivity for NS1 (i.e., 64.7%). Michishige <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that saliva samples collected by different methods of sampling were not equivalent in terms of total proteins and secretory IgA concentrations [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These different methods of saliva sampling should be compared in order to better define which one is the most suitable to perform each test.</p><p>The early identification of an ongoing DENV infection and a rapid implementation of specific clinical management procedures are key to ensure the best clinical outcome [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The current lack of simple and reliable prognostic marker to predict the risk of evolution of the patient towards a severe form of the disease makes the clinical management of the DENV infections extremely challenging, especially during epidemics and in countries with weak health systems. Among all the parameters evaluated within this study, the NS1 protein would theoretically be the ideal candidate for early diagnosis as this antigen is a marker of acute dengue infection that is easy and fast to detect. Anti-DENV antibodies usually appear only after the patient has already progressed toward the critical phase of infection. Conflicting results have been reported on a possible association between the concentration of free NS1 circulating in plasma and the disease severity. Although several studies reported a positive association [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], other studies have not [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In our study, which included a large number of patients experiencing primary and secondary infections, the multivariate analysis using BRT suggested that disease severity does not influence NS1 concentration in plasma during the acute phase of the disease but that plasmatic titers of anti-DENV IgG was the most important factor to explain free NS1 protein concentration in blood. Indeed, undetectable or very low levels of anti-DENV IgG antibodies were associated with higher concentrations of free NS1, the only fraction that is detected by the assays, while the NS1 fraction that is trapped into the immune-complexes is not captured in the diagnostic tests.</p><p>A potential association between the DENV-RNA load measured during the acute phase of the disease and disease severity has also been suggested, but the scientific literature reports conflicting findings [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Our BRT analysis suggests that the severity of infection was not associated to the RNA load in plasma during the acute phase of the disease (DAOF 0&#x02013;5). The level of anti-DENV IgG was the main parameter explaining the RNA load in the plasma specimens during the acute phase of the disease, with an inverse relationship like the one observed for NS1. The present report is the first to investigate the relationship between the NS1 concentration and the RNA load in plasma and the severity of the disease by using a multivariate analysis that included the anti-DENV IgG level. These findings require to be confirmed during other epidemics involving more patients and other infecting serotypes as this factor may affect both the RNA load and the NS1 concentration [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>Our study shows that urine and saliva could be considered for the diagnosis of dengue infection in some situations when optimal sensitivity is not necessarily required. These two body fluids provide different type of information. The saliva essentially mirrors what happens in the blood, which is not surprising as approximately 2.5% of the whole saliva is composed of gingival fluid, a protein-rich serum transudate, therefore reflecting the protein pattern in the serum. Antibodies titers in saliva are thus a few orders of magnitude lower compared to those in serum [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It was estimated that the IgA, IgG and IgM levels in saliva specimens were approximately 1/10, 1/800 and 1/400 of those measured in serum [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In urine, the detection of macromolecules such as IgGs (150 kDa), IgAs (320 kDA) and NS1 protein (300 kDa) most likely reflects an alteration of the glomerular filtration barrier which has three major components: the glomerular endothelial cells (GECs), the glomerular basement membrane and the podocytes. One of the characteristics of GECs is the presence of numerous fenestrations, which in theory should allow the passage of large molecules. GECs, however, are coated by a glycocalyx layer composed of glycosaminoglycans, which in normal conditions impedes the leakage of macromolecules. Abnormal disruption of the glycocalyx restores the passage of big molecules through the fenestration of the GECs [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. High-molecular-weight proteins cannot pass through the podocytes barrier in normal conditions, but the accumulation of such macromolecules probably induces an alteration of this structure, which in turn leads to a proteinuria [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It has been suggested that during dengue infection, impairment of the glycocalyx layer on endothelial cells could occur. Both the virus itself and the NS1 antigen are known to fix heparan sulfate, a major glycosaminoglycan of the glycocalyx [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Moreover Wills <italic>et al</italic>. observed an increased urinary heparan sulfate excretion in children with severe dengue infection compared to healthy control subjects, suggesting that an alteration of the glycocalyx layer may occur in severe dengue infections [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The presence of circulating immune complexes formed to eliminate the virus and the NS1 antigen may provide another possible explanation to the alteration of the glomerular barrier. Cases of glomerulonephritis with glomerular immune complex-type deposits have been reported during DENV infections [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Jessie <italic>et al</italic>. also described the presence of viral antigen suggestive of the presence of immune complexes in the kidney tubular cells from dengue-infected patients [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Further investigations are needed on the potential interactions of dengue virus, immune complexes, and other components of the immune response with heparan sulfate and other glycosaminoglycan of the glycocalyx but also with the other kidney cells to determine if subclinical kidney lesions do not occur more often during DENV infection.</p><p>In this study we were not able to evaluate the performances of the different diagnostic methods for all four dengue virus serotypes as it was conducted using well-characterized and sequential clinical samples prospectively collected during a DENV-1 epidemic, when the DENV-2 and DENV-4 were circulating at lower level and no DENV-3 was detected.</p><p>The results of our study demonstrate that the diagnosis of dengue infection in urine and saliva specimens is possible but we believe that there is certainly still a room for improvement of these assays. Existing commercial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) designed to be used with blood samples would probably require significant adjustments, as urine and saliva specimens are very different from whole blood, plasma or serum. One of the main differences resides in the huge difference in protein concentration. A Singaporean group has recently developed a rapid test for the detection of anti-DENV IgG in saliva. The device gave good results in saliva samples spiked with IgG but requires further optimization to detect IgG from the clinical samples of dengue-infected patients [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Recently, saliva samples were tested using a commercial ELISA initially developed for IgG detection in blood and demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity [<xref rid="pntd.0004100.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, although the performances of the different diagnostic methods evaluated here were not as good in saliva and urine as in plasma, results obtained with qRT-PCR and with antibody detection could justify the use of these two body fluids for the diagnosis of dengue infection for instances such as outbreak investigations or in young children (once they are old enough to comply to instructions), in addition to the situations when blood cannot be easily collected (e.g., lack of phlebotomist, refusal of the procedure, etc.). The disadvantage resulting from a slight decrease in the diagnostic confirmation performances when using molecular and serological tests in urine and saliva samples instead of blood is partially balanced by the ease to obtain these specimens and by the better compliance of the patient or by the number of individuals that can be investigated during studies when non-invasive sample collection methods are used. Moreover, the modest sensitivity of the test can be offset by high prevalence during the peak of an outbreak and/or when guided by competent clinicians. It results in high predictive positive value, making this test a useful addition for biological diagnosis in field conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"
