         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Forest-dependent biodiversity is threatened throughout the tropics by habitat loss
            and land-use intensification of the matrix habitats. We resampled historic data on
            two moth families, known to play central roles in many ecosystem processes, to evaluate
            temporal changes in species richness and community structure in three protected forests
            in central Uganda in a rapidly changing matrix. Our results show some significant
            declines in the moth species richness and the relative abundance and richness of forest-dependent
            species over the last 20–40 years. The observed changes in species richness and composition
            among different forests, ecological types, and moth groups highlight the need to repeatedly
            monitor biodiversity even within protected and relatively intact forests.

               </sup>
            </span>). In some regions, less than 10% of the original vegetation remains after clearance
            for agriculture and other purposes (Saunders et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). Tropical forests are among the habitats experiencing the highest loss rates. In
            addition to the area loss per se, deforestation has resulted in fragmentation of once-continuous
            forests; the resulting fragments are now surrounded by a matrix of other land-uses
            (Fahrig and Merriam 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">
               <sup>

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Species vulnerability to forest area loss and fragmentation is strongly affected by
            their ability to use these matrix landscapes (Gascon et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). Different species perceive the matrix differently: what is inhospitable to one
            may be habitable to another and what is a barrier to one may be easily traversed by
            another (Bowler and Benton 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). Consequently, ecological patterns and processes within patches may also be influenced
            by the nature of the surrounding matrix landscape (Ricketts

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Species response to landscape changes is influenced by key ecological and life-history
            attributes such as longevity, reproductive rates, body size, trophic specialization,
            and dispersal ability. These traits directly determine changes in abundance and mediate
            extinction risk (Pimm et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b59">1993</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Identifying how species with different traits are differentially affected by landscape
            change allows insight into shifts in communities or guild composition beyond simple
            changes in species richness (Williams et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b74">2010</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). One way to understand the mechanisms that determine the structure of communities
            is through the comparison of species diversity at different spatial and temporal scales
            in different ecological and biogeographical settings (Fukami and Wardle 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b23">2005</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Temporal patterns of biodiversity have received much less attention than spatial
            ones (Magurran et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b47">2010</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Such comparisons are important in developing and planning conservation program
            (e.g., Kremen et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">
               <sup>

            </span>) and provide a vital tool for management of wildlife (Turner et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">

            et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">

            </span>) but knowledge of population changes in insects lags behind that of vertebrates and
            vascular plants (Thomas et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). Despite their importance for many critical ecological functions, unparalleled contribution
            to biodiversity, and their potential use in conservation planning, long-term ecological
            studies of invertebrates are extremely scarce (Kremen et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b40">1993</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). For Lepidoptera, data on population size fluctuations and associated changes at
            community level are available for many temperate ecosystems but much less is known
            about their dynamics in the humid and seasonal tropics (e.g., Schulze and Fiedler
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">

               </sup>
            </span>). Moths play a central role in many ecosystem processes as prey, herbivores, and
            pollinators (Janzen 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b37">1987</a>

               </sup>
            </span>). Saturnidae (Silk moths) and Sphingidae (Hawk moths) are two of the most species-rich
            families of moths in the tropics (Janzen 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). They can be rapidly surveyed, identified and are relatively well documented, thus
            well placed to act as indicator groups. Members of the two families have differing
            life histories and feeding habits. Tropical Sphingidae are long-lived with a few exceptions,
            mate repeatedly, lay a few eggs per host plant and oviposit through adult life (e.g.,
            Haber and Frankie 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b27">1989</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). They are accomplished fliers with migratory tendencies in some taxa. In contrast,
            Saturnidae have short non feeding flight periods, lasting less than 10 days, mate
            once and lay many eggs. They are often associated with undisturbed forest habitats.
            Caterpillars of Saturnidae often select older leaves and are usually found in crowns
            of adult trees or woody vines, while Sphingidae are less particular about plant age
            and commonly feed on young leaves (Janzen 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). These factors make it likely that Sphingidae are typically better dispersers and
            less habitat specific than Saturnidae.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Most Ugandan forests and their matrix landscape have undergone considerable changes

            on the long-term ecological integrity of these protected forests in rapidly changing
            matrix landscapes. Based on the literature summarized above, we test the predictions
            that (1) moth species richness has declined over time; (2) forest-dependent species
            are more affected than the generalist species; and (3) Saturnidae will have declined
            more rapidly than Sphingidae.

            individuals (49 species) of Sphingidae across the three forests. The number of moths

            </span>), we observe large changes in moth communities. Although we do not have good estimates
            of the total moth richness, rarefaction curves suggest declining diversity. The most
            striking pattern is the change in the ecotype composition of the forests with consistent
            decline in the relative abundance of forest-dependent species and an associated increase
            in widespread species. In line with our predictions, Saturnidae were more affected.
            These declines in moths reported here are in line with patterns of moth declines recorded
            elsewhere around the world (e.g., Great Britain, Conrad et al.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Although sampling protocols and sampling efforts varied between the sampling periods,
            the number of individuals per trap night was comparable across the sample periods,
            suggesting that different trap types have approximately similar efficiencies. Summerville
            and Crist (

            </span>) found that differences among trap types contributed less than 10% to differences
            in richness. A similar study on moths in a lowland dipterocarp forest in Peninsular
            Malaysia using two different trap types (Intachat and Woiwod 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">

            </span>) will bias our results, but the direction of bias is opposite to the patterns we
            observe. Regarding sampling effort, a comparison between long-term sampling and short-term
            but intensive sampling yielded a 76% overlap in species recorded (Landau et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b43">1999</a>

            </span>). Similarly, Summerville and Crist (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b67">2005</a>

            </span>) reported that increased sampling effort only reduced the proportion of singletons
            and unique species and this peaked off after 10 trap nights. Therefore, we believe
            that the observed changes in rarefied species richness and species turnover among
            the Saturnidae and Sphingidae within these protected forests are real.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The weak patterns in overall species richness and diversity reflect the replacement
            of forest-dependent species with widespread species. Thus, the dramatic decline of
            forest-dependent species relative abundance and richness is masked by the rise of
            the widespread and generalist taxa. This highlights the limited utility of diversity
            metrics for conservation; indeed, they can be misleading.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Changes in moth diversity and abundance have often been correlated with or assumed
            to be caused by environmental changes within the study sites (Summerville et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">

               </sup>
            </span>). Despite past encroachment, these forests have either remained relatively stable
            in size and structure (Zika and Mpanga; Bulafu et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">

            and Eilu

            are only driven by environmental change within the forests.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Alternative explanations for the observed patterns in moth community within our study
            forests include the effect of increased isolation due to matrix transformation, extinction
            debt, and climate change. Habitat isolation in both space and time disrupts species
            distribution patterns, consequently affecting metapopulation dynamics of patch-dwelling
            populations. This makes matrix habitats strong determinants of fragmentation effects
            within remnants through regulating dispersal, dispersal-related mortality, and mediating
            edge-related microclimatic gradients (Ewers and Didham 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">

            the forest itself remaining stable with very low levels of disturbance. This is supported
            by the remote sensing forest loss analysis where over 60% of the forest area in a
            5-km buffer around Zika has been lost, the highest proportion of any of our forests
            (Hansen et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">

            of suitable habitats, have been implicated in the decline of moths elsewhere (e.g.,

            </span>). We found significant declines in the moths' richness and relative abundance of
            forest-dependent species especially in the poorly dispersed Saturnidae. In central
            Uganda, there has been massive intensification in the use of the matrix surrounding
            protected forests; previously, forested areas have been replaced by exotic plantations
            (e.g., oil palm, cardamom, or eucalyptus), agro-ecosystems (e.g., shade coffee and
            home gardens), or cleared for settlements and other human developments (Obua et al.
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">

               </sup>
            </span>). Matrix intensification can lead to a breakdown in metapopulation dynamics, making
            land-use-driven environmental changes outside reserves just as important as those
            within reserves in determining the fate of regional-scale biodiversity (e.g., Hanski
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">

            </span>). For example, a study on birds in the farmed landscapes of Central and southwestern
            parts of Uganda reported declines with increased land-use intensification especially
            among forest specialist species (Bolwig et al.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In tropical forests where historical forest area loss and landscape change are high,
            extinction debt might drive species loss long after forest reserve boundaries have
            stabilized (e.g., Kuussaari et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). The magnitude of extinction debt that can be expected is largely dependent on spatiotemporal
            configuration of habitat patches, the time since the habitat was altered and the nature
            of the alteration (Kuussaari et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">

            </span>) but also on the life-history traits of the assemblages. We expect that extinction
            debt would be repaid fastest in the small Zika forest, with its consequently small
            populations, leading to high rates of species loss.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In general, habitat specialists are more susceptible to habitat loss and degradation
               than generalists (e.g., Öckinger et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">

               </span>). In the earlier sampling periods, forest-dependent species especially those associated
               with woody plants were prevalent and abundant (McCrae unpublished, Howard and Davenport
               
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">

               good quality forests to survive.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The observed declines in forest-dependent species vs. increases in forest edge and
               widespread species within our study forests are indicative of the ability of nonspecialist
               species to utilize a much broader range of habitats across the landscape compared
               to the specialist species that require intact and less disturbed habitats for their
               survival. In a connected landscape, forest-dependent species may benefit from reinforcement
               between fragments as a result of metapopulation dynamics rescuing species from imminent
               extinction (Nee and May

               </span>) both note that forest specialist moths tend to be monophagous and feed on woody
               plants, trees, and vines, whereas moths that favor disturbed sites are often polyphagous,
               feeding on herbaceous and weedy food plants. This could potentially account for some
               of the variability in our data. Individual species' responses can thus be interpreted
               through their guild membership – as forests are lost or altered, monophagous (forest
               specialist) species are more likely to decline or go locally extinct than those that
               are polyphagous (i.e., generalist, Holloway and Hebert 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">

               resampling periods (e.g.,

               <i>Polyscias fulva</i>) which is a larval food plant for 
               <i>Imbrasia anthina</i>, is now scarcely found in its natural habitat within our study forests as result
               of unsustainable harvesting for making drums (Omeja et al.

               <i>Imbrasia anna</i> which feeds on several members of the Arecaceae family had larger populations in
               our dataset and has a wide geographic range compared to 
               <i>Imbrasia oyemensis</i> which is a forest-dependent species that only feeds on 
               <i>Entandrophragma angolense</i> – an IUCN red listed tree species. However, a shortage of trait data for most species
               of tropical Africa, especially larval host plants, hinders our inferences in this
               regard.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We found steeper declines among the Saturnidae than the Sphingidae. This is in accordance
               with our expectations based on the lifestyle and dispersal ability of the two families.
               Saturnidae caterpillars tend to feed on older leaves and are often found in the crowns
               of trees, whereas the Sphingidae tend not to be particular about plant age and commonly
               feed on younger leaves (Holloway and Hebert

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our results show some significant change in the moth communities in the target forests
            in the last 20–40 years. This highlights the need to repeatedly monitor biodiversity
            even within protected and relatively intact forests. Our findings together with similar
            patterns reported for trees (Bulafu et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b6">2013</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) in similar habitat settings indicate a worrying reduction in the capacity of protected
            forests in central Uganda to maintain biodiversity. Matrix intensification around
            our forests appears to have reduced the capacity of the landscape to buffer and support
            populations in protected forests. Removal of any functional groups will alter the
            ecological integrity of these forests. In our case, if an important fraction or entire
            guilds of species are lost (e.g., forest-dependent species as our data suggest), detrimental
            effects on ecological services mediated by these moths could become apparent. Protected
            forests are linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and failure to stem
            broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood
            of serious biodiversity declines.
