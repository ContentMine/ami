         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <i>Wolbachia</i> are endosymbionts found in many insects with the potential to suppress vectorborne
            diseases, particularly through interfering with pathogen transmission. 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> strains are highly variable in their effects on hosts, raising the issue of which
            attributes should be selected to ensure that the best strains are developed for disease
            control. This depends on their ability to suppress viral transmission, invade host
            populations, persist without loss of viral suppression and not interfere with other
            control strategies. The potential to achieve these objectives is likely to involve
            evolutionary constraints; viral suppression may be limited by the ability of infections
            to spread due to deleterious host fitness effects. However, there are exceptions to
            these patterns in both natural infections and in novel associations generated following
            interspecific transfer, suggesting that pathogen blockage, deleterious fitness effects
            and changes to reproductive biology might be at least partly decoupled to achieve
            ideal infection attributes. The stability of introduced 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> and its effects on viral transmission remain unclear, but rapid evolutionary changes
            seem unlikely. Although deliberate transfers of 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> across species remain particularly challenging, the availability of strains with
            desirable attributes should be expanded, taking advantage of the diversity available
            across thousands of strains in natural populations.

            <i>Wolbachia</i> are endosymbiotic bacteria living in all orders of insects and in other invertebrates.
            They are often promoted as a ‘natural’ way of manipulating insect hosts, in contrast
            to other approaches for manipulating vector biology, particularly through genetic
            modification, that are often regarded with suspicion because they involve novel constructs
            that are not present in the environment with the potential to spread to other nonvector
            species. While 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> are already widespread in the environment, they are restricted to living exclusively
            within host cells and spread by changing the biology of their host species (O'Neill
            et al.

            host reproduction, the 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> strain should stay at a high frequency in that population without further releases

            stability of effects generated by

            spread. Horizontal transmission of

            impact on their host, but nevertheless persist because of a high fidelity of vertical
            transmission from mothers to offspring. Such infections with no apparent phenotypic
            effects on hosts have been described in 
            <i>Drosophila</i> species (e.g. Hoffmann et al.

            <i>Wolbachia</i> strains are likely to have dramatic effects on their host; the most widespread of
            these effects is cytoplasmic incompatibility, where 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> presence leads to the death of embryos and sometimes immature offspring when infected
            fathers mate with uninfected mothers (or mothers carrying a different 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> strain). There are also 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> infections that cause the death of male offspring only (male killers) and others
            that lead to parthenogenetic reproduction in haplodiploid organisms or feminization
            of male offspring (reviewed in O'Neill et al.

            <i>Wolbachia</i> density often varies substantially among individuals under field conditions (e.g.

            density of the 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> infection among host lines was maintained for several generations, but was eventually

               <i>Wolbachia</i> strains have now been transferred through microinjection across species boundaries,
               particularly in the genus 
               <i>Drosophila</i>, but also across genera within and among insect orders (Table 
               <span ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">

               <i>Wolbachia</i> transfers can be challenging, although those involving 
               <i>Drosophila</i> species have been undertaken for some time and have become fairly routine (e.g. Poinsot

            <i>Wolbachia</i> strains available in natural populations of insects related to mosquitoes. Yet, they
            are already raising questions about how 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> strains and host backgrounds might be developed for disease suppression.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Different strain attributes are required by the three strategies that use 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> to reduce disease transmission. The simplest requirement is for population suppression
            
            <i>via</i> male release where the main attribute is for released males to exhibit strong cytoplasmic
            incompatibility when they mate with field females. Released males also need to be
            competitive with males from natural populations. Competitive ability could be reduced
            if 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> in the release strain directly reduces male competitive fitness and/or if the host
            nuclear background of the release strain has a detrimental effect on male field competitiveness.
            At least for 
            <i>Ae.aegypti</i> carrying the 
            <i>w</i>Mel or 
            <i>w</i>MelPop infection, there is no evidence that 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> directly reduces male competitive fitness (Segoli et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b131">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b131">2014</a>
               </sup>
            </span>), while 
            <i>Ae. polynesiensis</i> carrying 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> are also competitive in field releases (O'Connor et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b110">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b110">2012</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Detrimental host nuclear effects might develop if the release strain evolves and
            becomes adapted to conditions used for artificial rearing. This can be circumvented
            through backcrossing the release strain to field-sourced material prior to releases
            taking place, although it may then be more difficult to rear the strain under the
            artificial conditions if adaptation has taken place. Male competitiveness also needs
            to be high for successful 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> strategies involving invasion (that utilize deleterious fitness effects and viral
            interference) because strong cytoplasmic incompatibility is required to drive the
            infection into a target population. In addition, several other attributes will be
            required for invasion-based strategies.

               of the 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> on the hosts and as long as the infection is transmitted with a relatively high fidelity,
               invasion should be possible under strong cytoplasmic incompatibility. However, if
               a focal population is already infected with a 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> strain that shows bidirectional incompatibility with the release strain, invasion
               becomes more difficult. Under bidirectional incompatibility between two 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> strains with equivalent deleterious effects on a host, the infection frequency of
               an introduced strain has to exceed 50% to achieve invasion (Hoffmann and Turelli

               carrying the 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> strain to feed and locate breeding sites and the ability of larvae with the

            <i>Wolbachia</i> and/or host genomes could also evolve in response to any changes in the virus, particularly

            <i>D</i>. 
            <i>melanogaster</i> strains and 
            <i>Culex quinquefasciatus</i> strains suggested that

            <i>Wolbachia</i> densities in natural infections are too low to have much impact on transmission of
            this virus. On the other hand, in a recent study where 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> from another mosquito were injected into 
            <i>Culex dorsalis</i> females, the titre of West Nile virus increased (Dodson et al.

            </span>), although this may have been an effect of the infection process; the effect of 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> on West Nile needs to be investigated in a host mosquito species carrying a stably

            <i>Wolbachia</i> infection. In 
            <i>Spodoptera</i> moths, 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> may also increase susceptibility to a virus (Graham et al.

            of 
            <i>Wolbachia</i>, and laboratory tests with one of the 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> strains (likely a male killer) indicated much higher mortality levels following the
            viral infection. Because nucleopolydrovirus is being explored as a potential biopesticide,
            this result might point to a potentially novel application of 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> releases for pest control.

            <i>Wolbachia</i> and pesticide susceptibility. For 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes that are artificially infected with

            natural selection. Mitochondrial variation might play an important role in the epistatic
            interaction between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in determining insect metabolic
            rate under varying environmental conditions (Arnqvist et al.

            <i>Wolbachia</i> invasion could affect the performance of infected populations.

            <i>Wolbachia</i> effects on host fitness could change the size and age distribution of the mosquito
            larval community in containers (Mains et al.

            under high-density larval conditions when fitness differences between 
            <i>Wolbachia</i>-infected strains and uninfected strains can become accentuated (Ross et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b127">

            </span>). These ecological effects of 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> need to be evaluated following invasions into natural communities and could have
            a substantial effect on disease transmission if vector populations become suppressed
            due to the detrimental effects of 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> infection. The most dramatic example involves the 
            <i>w</i>MelPop infection of 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, which reduces the viability of eggs when held in a dried state (Yeap et al.

               </sup>
            </span>). During a dry season, this effect could result in the complete collapse of an isolated
            population until there is a reinvasion from another source (Rašić et al.

               </span>). Part of the blockage may come from the upregulation of the immune system, as suggested
               by the increased expression of some immune response genes following recent 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> transfers in mosquitoes (Kambris et al.

               </span>). However, cross-species transfers of 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> do not necessarily lead to immune priming, as in the case of the experimental 
               <i>w</i>Au infection of 
               <i>D</i>.

               as cholesterol, interactions involving various metabolites, and the expression of
               microRNAs (Caragata et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">

               and density of 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> particularly following transfer to a new host. For instance, native 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> infections of 
               <i>Ae. albopictus</i> have a relatively low density; the natural 
               <i>w</i>AlbB infection of 
               <i>Ae. albopictus</i> seems to cause some suppression of dengue and chikungunya viruses in its native host

               between pathogen blockage, deleterious fitness effects and cytoplasmic incompatibility.
               Host effects are not necessarily tightly linked mechanistically or through density,
               and a trade-off between blockage and spread might exist when host effects are predominantly
               related to density, but might in other cases be circumvented (Fig. 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</span>). The 
               <i>Drosophila</i> data indicate that strains such as 
               <i>w</i>Au with strong blockage, no deleterious effects, high densities and no cytoplasmic
               incompatibility exist in populations alongside strains such as 
               <i>w</i>Ha that cause strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, but no blockage or large deleterious
               effects. A range of infections with different combinations of attributes occur in
               natural populations, including strains that might exhibit relatively strong blockage
               while also being able to easily spread in the absence of over replication after eclosion,
               and a high density in reproductive tissues to ensure strong cytoplasmic incompatibility
               and high maternal transmission. Unfortunately, the same combination of attributes
               might not be maintained after such a strain is transferred to a target vector host.
               For example, the 
               <i>w</i>Mel infection causes weak cytoplasmic incompatibility in its native 
               <i>Drosophila</i> host but complete cytoplasmic incompatibility once transferred to 
               <i>Ae. aegypti,</i> which has been essential for its successful spread (Hoffmann et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">
                  <sup>
                     <a href="#b71">2011</a>
                  </sup>
               </span>). Similarly, the 
               <i>w</i>Au infection has no detectable fitness effect in its native host 
               <i>D</i>. 
               <i>simulans,</i> but causes a sharp reduction in lifespan and exhibits exponential growth when transferred
               to 
               <i>D</i>. 
               <i>melanogaster</i> (Chrostek et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">

                  </sup>
               </span>). Therefore, intra- and intergeneric transfers across host species have unexpected
               consequences that may affect the suitability of strains for disease suppression.

               <i>Wolbachia</i>-based strategies for disease suppression can be identified to some extent, the final
               strategy and strain adopted will also depend on community acceptance and regulatory
               approval. A challenge for 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> releases aimed at invasion and replacement is that there will be a period of time
               when mosquito numbers are increased above background levels to ensure that the 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> infection exceeds an invasion threshold. As long as there are no fitness costs associated
               with the infection, 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> is expected to spread from a very low starting frequency (close to 0%) depending
               on stochastic factors, with a slow rate of spread initially (Jansen et al.

               <i>simulans</i> where resident populations number in the millions (Kriesner et al.

               <i>w</i>Mel invasion into uninfected 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> required releases across 10 weeks, at which time adult numbers increased by a factor

               only one mosquito species is being targeted in release areas where several species
               are likely to co-occur, implementation of such a strategy can be challenging. In most
               countries where dengue is endemic and attributable to 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes which breed around houses, communities are encouraged to decrease the
               availability of breeding sites, removing containers that might hold standing water,
               treating containers with chemicals, and perhaps fogging an entire area with pesticides.
               Such combined programmes can be effective in reducing mosquito densities (Erlanger

               </span>), making it difficult to justify such campaigns. Nevertheless, while education and
               engagement campaigns can help increase acceptance of 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> releases (McNaughton and Huong

               months where frequencies exceeded 70% (T. H. Nguyen, unpublished data). Even when
               this infection invaded semi-field cages, it required more than 80 days before the

            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">One of the advantages of 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> releases is that they are not necessarily incompatible with other control programmes.
               For instance, during the 2011 release of 
               <i>w</i>Mel around Cairns, Australia, pesticides were applied by the health authorities to
               a residential block within the release site where a dengue case had been reported,
               and this did not inadvertently affect the local rate of increase of 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> (Hoffmann et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">
                  <sup>
                     <a href="#b71">2011</a>
                  </sup>
               </span>). In this case, both the resident uninfected population of 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and the released mosquitoes did not contain appreciable levels of insecticide resistance.
               In contrast, in many communities where there has been widespread application of pyrethroids
               and other insecticides over some time, resistance levels in uninfected 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> are expected to be high (Ranson et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b119">
                  <sup>
                     <a href="#b119">2009</a>
                  </sup>
               </span>). In such cases, insecticide application during the release could lead to a preferential
               removal of the infected released mosquitoes. However, it should be possible to minimize
               this issue by backcrossing infected release stock to the local genetic background
               of a target population with high insecticide resistance.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Finally, when there are community concerns about release numbers increasing above
               background levels, suppression of mosquitoes prior to starting releases could help
               to alleviate community concerns, as well as speeding up 
               <i>Wolbachia</i> invasions by increasing the frequency of 
               <i>Wolbachia</i>, and by producing vacant breeding sites for infected released females. In addition,
               it may be possible to release large numbers of nonbiting infected male mosquitoes
               to facilitate invasions when these males generate cytoplasmic incompatibility with
               uninfected mosquitoes (Hancock et al. 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">
                  <sup>
                     <a href="#b55">2011</a>
                  </sup>
               </span>). Pesticide applications could also assist invasions if the release material carries
               a higher level of resistance than the resident population (Hoffmann and Turelli 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">
                  <sup>
                     <a href="#b65">2013</a>
                  </sup>
               </span>). Although there is little risk that resistance alleles will spread to the uninfected
               resident populations as long as cytoplasmic incompatibility is complete and maternal
               transmission is high, this strategy is unlikely to be approved by regulators except
               in limited circumstances, for instance, where relevant genes are already present in
               a target population.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Selecting a suitable strain of 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> for release is not a straightforward process, and involves a balance between minimizing
            fitness costs while maximizing cytoplasmic incompatibility and blockage of disease
            agents, as well as considering community and regulatory issues. It is not yet clear
            to what extent desirable strain qualities can be combined or whether there are trade-offs
            that limit the options available. It seems essential to create and test a number of
            
            <i>Wolbachia</i> infections for releases, despite the challenges associated with this exercise that
            require thousands of microinjections to achieve success (McMeniman et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b97">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b97">2009</a>
               </sup>
            </span>; Bian et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#b13">2013b</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Nevertheless, there are many natural 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> strains available within Diptera for potential introduction into disease vectors.
            Once a suitable strain has been identified, it will be necessary to monitor the long-term
            stability of the desirable effects because there may be further evolutionary changes
            in the host, 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> and pathogen genomes that could modify 
            <i>Wolbachia</i> effects, even though current data suggest they are relatively stable.
