         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It is believed that symbiotic visions can drive employees and organizations toward
            a common objective based on the premise that people have a high level of self-motivation
            and engagement when they are working toward something very personal. The field of
            organizational development has been aspiring to help organizations and people align
            their visions for decades without much, if any, empirical support for the role of
            personal purpose and goals in the symbiotic relationship with a company vision. This
            qualitative study examines the role personal purpose and goals play in how high performing
            leaders align to their company's vision. Whether and how senior managers articulate
            this alignment, and its correlation to their motivation and engagement, was examined.
            An observation was that most senior managers within organizations with a well-developed
            and widely known higher purpose vision are driven by something personal, identified
            as either personal goals or a personal purpose. One of the key findings is that personal
            purpose and goals, when aligned to a company vision, appear to impact motivation and
            engagement in different ways. When alignment is felt through the sense of the greater
            purpose, there is a deep, almost spiritual, commitment to making the world a better
            place and helping the organization contribute to that. This seems to motivate them
            to guide the organization toward its higher purpose vision. When alignment is felt
            through the organization's alignment to one's personal goals, there is a great sense
            of commitment to completing the steps or tasks necessary to move toward the vision,
            yet a clear delineation between work and life ambitions.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Certain people appear to be motivated and engaged in achieving an aspirational purpose
            or personal goal such that it aligns their efforts, their thinking, and their decision
            making. The contemporary research on the topics of purpose, company vision, motivation
            and engagement is prolific. Duffy and Dik (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B30">2013</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) referenced approximately 40 recent studies on the topic of purpose and calling and
            the connection to work-related and general well-being (Duffy and Dik, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B30">2013</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Also, there are numerous practitioner books on using purpose, calling, and vision
            to reach the heart of an employee, such as 
            <i>Purpose and Meaning in the Workplace</i> (Dik et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B26">2013</a>
               </sup>
            </span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Yet, even if individuals are externally motivated by a company's vision and are working
            in a stimulating environment, they are still unlikely to experience the intrinsic
            motivation, engagement, and fulfillment that comes from working toward the accomplishment
            of one's own personal ambition (Boyatzis and Akrivou, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">2006</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Consider that often, at work, one is coached to comply with someone else's vision
            (Boyatzis et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B16">2012</a>
               </sup>
            </span>); working hard to be the underling their boss wants them to be in order to contribute
            to the goals of the organization. Instead of advancing toward one's personal definition
            of who they want to become, their ideal self, employees are working toward an “ought
            self,” or the understanding of what one should be based on someone else's vision (Boyatzis
            and Akrivou, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">2006</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Through the development of the self-determination theory and the need for competency
            and autonomy, Deci and Ryan (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B24">2000b</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) contributed to understanding motivation in the social context; explaining that experiencing
            motivation and engagement by embracing someone else's vision may very well work for
            a while. Boyatzis and Akrivou (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">2006</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) advanced the understanding by discovering that one can be perfectly content working
            toward someone else's goal or objectives until one realizes that their personal dreams
            are being compromised because this “ought self” does not match their ideal self. This
            awakening leads to feelings of betrayal and frustration for having wasted energy pursuing
            the dreams and expectations of others. This creates what Boyatzis (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">2008</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) called negative emotional attractors (NEA) which have an adverse effect on motivation
            and engagement (Boyatzis and Akrivou, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">2006</a>

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This study is timely for businesses because employee commitment to the organization,
            connection to its purpose and engagement at work are all cited as major motivators
            of people staying in a company (Ashforth and Mael, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1989</a>

               </sup>
            </span>). From the individual's perspective, it has long been identified in the literature
            that the work one does is significant to a person's sense of meaning and identity.
            In 
            <i>Purpose and Meaning in the Workplace</i>, the editors pull from work all the way back to Adler in 1931 and Erikson in 1963
            to support their statement that, “Along with love, play, and community, work at its
            best offers a core context for construction of self and contributing to society in
            ways heartfelt, personally meaningful and socially relevant” (Dik et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B26">2013</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, p. 17). Yet, there is limited empirical support for the role one's personal ambitions
            play in the symbiotic relationship to a company's higher purpose vision.

         <h2>Research question</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This research is about understanding the roles personal purpose and goals play in
            the symbiotic relationship with their company's vision. To be able to understand personal
            purpose and goals it was important to minimize the other variables. Because it would
            be expected that high performers are already motivated and engaged, interviewing high
            performers allowed me to focus on the nature of personal purpose and goals without
            the added complexity of whether motivation and engagement exist. The research question
            for this study is: What are the roles of the personal purpose and goals of high performing
            leaders in symbiotic relationships with their company's higher purpose vision?

         <h2>Literature review</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The understanding of purpose has evolved quite significantly over the past 60 years.
            Prior to the 1959 publication of Frankl's book 
            <i>Man's Search for Meaning</i>, purpose and meaning were understood to be a way of adapting and not as a motivator
            toward change (Damon et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B20">2003</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Frankl was the first to identify purpose and meaning as more than derivatives of
            motivation by recognizing them as the drivers used to overcome circumstances (Frankl,
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B32">1959</a>
               </sup>
            </span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Personal purpose, meaning and calling are often interrelated (Elangovan et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B31">2010</a>
               </sup>
            </span>), and/or used interchangeably with each other (Boyatzis and Akrivou, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">2006</a>

               <sup>
                  <a href="#B31">2010</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) indicates that purpose and calling hold many of the same attributes, such as hope
            and a focus on others, based on an inner desire to stay true to oneself and to do
            the right thing, make the world a better place or pursue a well-meaning goal (Elangovan
            et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B31">2010</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). When working toward a “calling,” one receives personal gratification (Novak, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B53">1996</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) and a sense of personal purpose (Hall and Chandler, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B35">2005</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). It is personal and the tasks are more enriching (Cardador et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B17">2011</a>
               </sup>
            </span>), which is intellectually and emotionally stimulating (Bakker et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2008</a>

                  <a href="#B50">2009</a>
               </sup>
            </span>) describe purpose as a “centralized, self-organizing life aim that organizes and
            stimulates goals, manages behaviors, and provides a sense of meaning” (p. 242). Whereas,
            a calling is thought to be bestowed upon one by a higher power or a response to a
            strong inner passion, and a purpose is discovered or found, calling and purpose both
            drive action and define one's identity (Elangovan et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B31">2010</a>

            </span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Recent research has made some progress deconstructing and discerning meaning and purpose.
            Rainey cited much of the research already referenced as well as work by Heintzelman
            and King (2014), Hicks, Cicero, Trent, Curton, and King (2010), and Rockind (2011)
            to conclude that the “two are distinct phenomena that differ in their orientation
            toward cognition or action and in their temporal framing. Meaning and purpose are
            separate, albeit highly related, constructs that build off of one another so as to
            contribute to the broader concept of the ‘good,’ or meaningful life” (Rainey, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B56">2014</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, p. 22). This deconstruction connects meaning to an integration of the past, present,
            and future whereas purpose is a future directed element of meaning that may not integrate
            past and present (Baumeister et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In addition to being future directed, the construct of purpose is becoming more understood
            to include doing something that a person feels driven to do in which the benefactor
            or benefactors are not themselves (Duffy and Sedlacek, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In this study, I sought to explore the impact of purpose, separate from both a calling
            from a higher source and making meaning through an integration of past experiences,
            while still holding to the elements of purpose that appear to have consistently emerged
            in psychological literature. For this study, I defined personal purpose as: 
            <i>a deliberate choice to pursue a future directed intention that is personally meaningful,

               they appear to be relevant to achieving personal aspirations, but in different ways.
               In existing research, motivation is connected to determination, while engagement is
               linked to a state of awareness. Motivation is what creates action and drive (Berlyne,

               </span>), whereas engagement is the state of mind and energy committed to that action and
               accomplishment (Kapoor and Meachem,

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Motivation has been associated with harnessing personal drive in several theories
               developed over time. Maslow's need for self-actualization created a foundation for
               personal motivation with his statement that, “What a man can be, he must be” (Maslow,
               
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">

                  </sup>
               </span>, p. 380). This statement infers that self-actualization drives one to work toward
               what one “could” be. Herzberg (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">

               </span>) made a big contribution to the understanding of motivation by introducing the contrast
               between extrinsic (e.g., external rewards) and intrinsic motivation (e.g., personal
               sense of achievement or connection with the work itself). With the exception of the
               external impact of relationships, this study is primarily about intrinsic motivation.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It appears that the more personal the accomplishment, or intrinsic the center of causality,
               the higher the motivation to excel. Mallett and Hanrahan applied the social-cognitive
               theory of motivation in the context of elite athletes. In their study, they concluded
               that elite athletes “were highly driven by multiple personal goals and, in particular,
               self-determined motivation” (Mallett and Hanrahan,

               </span>, p. 198). They found a noticeable difference in the effort and drive in athletes
               that wanted to succeed because of personal ambition vs. athletes that were driven
               by external forces and rewards. In essence, the more the locus of causality is internal,
               the higher the degree of self-determination (Mallett and Hanrahan,

               of personal engagement and disengagement, Khan built upon existing literature on “person
               to role” relationships done by Lawler and Hall 1970, Lodahl and Kejner, 1965, Mowday
               et al., 1982, Porters et al., 1974, Blauner, 1964, and Seeman 1972 (Kahn,

                  </sup>
               </span>). He articulated the terms 
               <i>personal engagement</i> and 
               <i>disengagement</i> to “refer to the behaviors by which people bring in or leave out their personal selves
               during work role performances” (Kahn,

               </span>, p. 694). The term 
               <i>engagement</i> was later defined by Harter, Schmidt and Hayes as a person's involvement in and satisfaction
               with their work (Harter et al.,

               </span>). A 
               <i>high</i> level of engagement is the result of being stimulated, positive and fulfilled with
               a strong sense of meaningful pursuit and dedication (Bakker et al.,

               commonly understood to generate higher levels of energy and a strong connection to
               work. Boyatzis, Smith, and Beveridge also connected engagement with increased energy,
               focus and drive through their research on “Positive Emotional Attractors.” They validated
               this theory by linking PEA to physical stimulation—identifying the physiological activation
               that occurs during the actual experience of an elevated state of engagement, hopefulness,
               and future orientation. When reaching for a personal vision one is engaged, emotionally
               and physically, in moving toward an overarching goal. The goal becomes meaningful
               and purposeful enough to impact their energy, their focus and their drive (Boyatzis
               et al., 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">

               </span>). This is also supported by the evidence that the desire to achieve one's “ought
               self,” or the self that we feel we ought to be, is less than the desire to reach for
               our ideal self. When we are working to accomplish a goal or vision that is not our
               own, we are less driven (Higgins,

               another person or an employer). This is relevant because it illustrates there may
               be a difference between the individual who is striving to achieve a company vision
               that is not their own, and the individual who is striving to achieve their personal

               The concept is that a higher purpose vision positions a company to build a financially
               sustainable organization that creates both social good (e.g., making the world a better
               place) and social capital (e.g., trusting and committed relationships with all stakeholders)

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Relationships are very relevant to this study on the personal, social, and organizational
               level. According to Van Oosten (

                     <a href="#B66">2006</a>
                  </sup>
               </span>), supportive and trusting relationships are the fulcrum that allows change to take
               place. Positive relationships are correlated with a greater degree of engagement,
               commitment, and retention (Dirks and Ferrin, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">

                  </sup>
               </span>). In the intentional change theory, relationships actually facilitate the movement
               through each discovery that brings about purposeful change. A correlation was identified
               between the pursuit of the ideal self and the physiological effect it has on neural
               circuits, appetite for learning and the emotional state of elation; all increasing
               the level of engagement around one's dreams, hopes, and strengths (Boyatzis and Akrivou,

               of one's self to his or her group memberships. Although the initial context was to
               explain the tendency to elevate one's self image by identifying with groups or categories,
               the framework has been extended. Boyatzis and Akrivou validated the connection between
               group relationships to elements of individual performance and organizational direction,
               beyond the original connection to self-elevation.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The intentional change theory establishes that positive, energizing relationships
               are not only critical in supporting change but a sense of group identity is an important
               element in the construct of shared vision (Boyatzis and Akrivou,

                  </sup>
               </span>). Identification with the social identity of an organization facilitates the internalization
               of company values and beliefs (Ashforth and Mael, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">

               </span>). Ashforth and Mael referenced research already done on social identities within
               the organizational framework when they wrote that, “Organizational identification
               has long been recognized as a critical construct in the literature on organizational
               behavior, affecting both the satisfaction of the individual and the effectiveness
               of the organization (Brown, 1969; Hall, Schneider and Nygren, 1970; Patchen, 1970;
               Lee, 1971; Rotondi, 1975; O'Reilly and Chatman, 1986)” (Ashforth and Mael,

               motivation, engagement, and relationships have been emerging over time but there appear
               to be enough common elements in their definition to use as a foundation for gaining
               a greater understanding of the nature of personal purpose and goals when a company's
               vision is symbiotic with the aspirational purpose or goals of the individuals.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Data was gathered through interviews with open ended questions; allowing the interview
            process to be flexible, and the conversation to flow and evolve. The interviews were
            designed to pull out stories and personal experiences that illustrated connections
            between personal purpose, goals, corporate vision, positive relationships, engagement
            and motivation. Understanding that one's personal purpose is often evolving and changing,
            the questions were intended to capture the connections between their understanding
            of their personal purpose or goals at that time. The questions used during the interview
            process are listed in the Appendix—Supplementary Materials.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Because the literature indicated that even in the academic world the words purpose,

            with, a company's higher purpose vision, I selected a group that would most likely

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">I sought out companies that had a higher purpose statement that was communicated publicly.
            A higher purpose statement was defined as an articulated vision statement that is
            future directed and beneficial to the greater society. Companies with a published
            higher purpose statement were identified through personal networks and publications
            that recognized businesses as having a higher purpose vision. The initial quantity
            of possible candidates was large to assure there were enough companies that fit the
            criteria. Each recommendation was vetted to meet the definition of higher purpose
            by researching the company online, reviewing company literature, as well as asking
            people within the industry, and within the organization, to determine if the company
            indeed had a higher purpose that was shared within the company.

            company had multiple layers of management, enough breadth to include more than six
            high performing leaders, and an established performance review process. The organizations
            in which I conducted interviews all had annual sales revenue above $600 million.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">I conducted interviews within four companies that met the criteria, and provided geographical
            and industry diversity. I was introduced to the CHRO, company president or divisional
            vice-president by mutual acquaintances. They connected me with an internal resource
            who identified members of the senior leadership team considered to be high performers.
            High performers were defined as individuals who had received an “exceeds expectations”
            or the equivalent rating on their performance reviews as established within the individual
            organizations, or were identified as high performers by their supervisor.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">One of the outcomes of the goal-setting theory is that goals refer to important future
            outcomes and therefore, the selection of goals infers a desire to achieve a purpose
            or consequence; and success is associated with one's ability to pursue and accomplish
            goals that are important and meaningful (Locke and Latham, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). Because a person may have a goal to accomplish a personal purpose it was important
            to find people who interpreted success through the completion of the task or goal
            as well as people who were motivated to complete the task only if it led to a much
            greater purpose. In order to have two different groups for comparison purposes, I
            selected a sample within each organization that included people who were considered
            by their supervisor as primarily goal/task driven as well as people who were considered
            purpose driven.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Very early on it became clear that when the only choice a supervisor was given to
            describe the primary driver was purpose or goal, the perception of purpose was more
            favorable. Only 30% of the people interviewed were identified as goal driven by their
            supervisor. One statement made during an interview reflected this negative connotation
            of being goal driven:
         </p>
         <div tagxxx="disp-quote">
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">“I mean, not goal driven the way that some people are, and as an example meaning,
               I want to be worth this by a certain date or I want to have this kind of house by,
               or I have a Lamborghini by the time I am this age. I don't have goals that overt that
               I need to be—I need to have this particular title by a certain age. I don't have goals
               like that” 4-6.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Through the axial coding process, distinct themes emerged but the categorization of
            the responses did not always match up with the original classification of goal or
            purpose driven as provided by their supervisor. Saldana discusses allowing conceptual
            frameworks to emerge from within the data (Saldaña, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B58">2013</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). It became apparent early on in the process of coding interviews that the way people
            responded to the first question was creating such a conceptual framework. The first
            question I asked the participants was, “What is important to you, motivates you to
            hop out of bed in the morning, and/or provides purpose or meaning to your life?” Two
            very distinct categories emerged. The phenomenon of the role personal purpose and
            personal goals had on symbiotic visions was clearly differentiated within two distinct
            areas of context, with the context being an individual's primary driver. This is supported
            by the statement that thematic sampling depends heavily on the quality of the data
            which is influenced by the setting or context (Boyatzis, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B11">1998</a>

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To eliminate the possibility of misclassifications by the supervisor due to possible
            negative connotations with being goal driven, and to avoid projecting, I identified
            a related and unbiased classification that could be applied to the subject's responses.
            Although I am really studying goals vs. purpose, the task vs. socio-emotional drivers
            construct (Boyatzis et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>) is closely related and created an unbiased classification. This categorization was
            selected because it represents the contrast between being task or goal driven vs.
            future or purpose directed.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The way participants responded to the first question indicated their inclination for
            having task or socio-emotional/future oriented tendencies. Task-positive preferences
            are connected to being goal oriented and include a predilection for goal achievement,
            problem solving, decision making and the ability to control actions. Respondents were
            classified as task positive if their answers included being motivated by being acknowledged
            or appreciated for the work completed, maintaining balance, seeking opportunities,
            the work they do or solving problems. Socio-emotional preferences are much more future
            or purpose directed and are linked to social cognition, creativity and an openness
            to new ideas (Boyatzis et al., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">

            </span>). Respondents were classified as socio-emotional if their answers included being
            motivated by one's passion, making the world better, the desire to make a difference

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Twenty-four people were interviewed; seven interviews from one company, six interviews
               from two companies and five interviews at a fourth company. The interviews averaged
               an hour in length. Because of the narrow focus of my study, after twenty two interviews
               no new themes were emerging and it was not necessary to expand the interview pool
               beyond 24.

               participant. Eleven interviews were conducted over the phone with the participant
               finding a quiet location that would allow them to reflect without interruption. IRB
               protocol was followed to assure consent, accuracy and confidentiality. Seventeen participants
               were based out of their corporate office and seven were based in other cities, outside
               their corporate headquarters location, around the United States. Participants were
               located in the states of Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts, New York and Wisconsin.
               After the interview, participants were categorized by industry, tenure at their current

               the web application Dedoose. After completing an initial coding on all interviews,
               interviews were reviewed to verify that consistent coding was applied. Focused coding
               was used to synthesize large sections of data (Glaser,

               themes and the existence of dominant themes (Strauss,

               appear to be more motivated by the actual goal or milestone whereas socio-emotional

               in their vernacular, it was used differently. One hundred percent of the respondents
               that were categorized as task positive made references to being goal oriented or motivated
               by the accomplishment of the goal whereas 62% of the socio-emotional group referenced

               measurable objective, whereas the socio-emotional group appears to use goals to align
               their activities toward a more holistic, far reaching purpose. Eighty-four percent
               of the socio-emotional group referenced or communicated a passion toward something
               that was very meaningful to them and 62% referenced a purpose that was driving their
               decisions. This compared to 18% that referenced a passion and 27% that made references

            <h3>Temporal perspective—there appears to be a noticeable difference in the temporal perspective
               of the decisions being made. decisions appeared to be made based on either the immediate
               task (transaction) or because the decision is foundational to transforming or achieving
               a greater, longer term objective
            </h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This is best illustrated by the proverb of giving someone a fish vs. teaching someone
               to fish—if you give someone a fish they'll eat for a day; if you teach someone to
               fish they'll eat for a lifetime. Tuckey, Bakker and Dollard credit Bass, Jung, Sosik,
               and Pearce for articulating the behavioral styles of transactional vs. transformational
               leadership. Transactional leadership is tied to motivating others through a direct
               relationship between the task and the reward, whereas transformational leadership
               is recognized as influencing, inspiring, and stimulating others (Tuckey et al., 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">

                  </sup>
               </span>). It is possible to extend this framework to decision making. Individuals in group
               1 that are more prone to task positive tendencies, also appear to exhibit a more immediate
               and transactional perspective. They appear to make decisions based on having an impact
               on a case by case basis such that they can connect the activity to a reward. This
               group appears to demonstrate a desire to accomplish a goal because of the reward associated
               with its completion and getting satisfaction out of the task at hand. They referenced
               setting goals that were in the near future, a one-off that could stand alone and once
               accomplished, allowed them to move on to another goal. Sixty-four percent of the task
               positive oriented group articulated a preference for accomplishing a task that had
               definite completion criteria. Examples of task positive statements are as follows:

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">I studied high performing leaders who worked for corporations that espoused a higher
            purpose vision. I found that leaders were able to articulate their purpose or meaning
            and they were able to express alignment of their purpose or personal goals with that
            of the organization. One of the key discoveries was that personal purpose and goals
            do appear to play a role in a symbiotic relationship with a company vision and one's
            articulation of how they are motivated and engaged—but in different ways depending
            on whether a person is primarily socio-emotional driven or task driven. It was observed
            that some of these executives had a deep and far reaching sense of purpose which seemed
            tied to driving the intent of the organization's higher purpose vision. When alignment
            was felt through the sense of the greater purpose, there was a symbiotic nature to
            this alignment; a deep, almost spiritual, commitment to deploying all aspects of their
            life, e.g., work and home, to making the world a better place and helping the organization
            be a contributing part of their personal purpose. Others had a task oriented way of
            describing their purpose which appeared more instrumental in helping move the organization
            toward its overall purpose through the achievement of goals and objectives. When alignment
            was felt through the organization's support of one's personal goals, there was a great
            sense of commitment, but a clear delineation between work and life ambitions.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This difference was found to influence how high-performing leaders were motivated
            to act and engage. Task-driven individuals were found to be more self-referent; motivated
            by the actual accomplishment of goals/milestones; more likely to make decisions based
            on being able to see the completion of the task in the near future; and clear that
            life and work were separate. Individuals who were socio-emotional in nature were found
            to be more other-oriented; more likely to focus on the greater purpose of an activity;
            more likely to make decisions with a long term, big picture in mind; and more likely
            to see their work as an integral vs. separate part of their life.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It is important to note that both groups spoke of the importance of connecting with
            others and relationships with people. Half of the task positive group made references
            to team identity whereas no one in the socio-emotional group spoke about the personal
            connections to a team. There is an opportunity to explore this deeper in future research.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The senior leaders interviewed gravitated toward either a self-referent or other-referent
               perspective which aligned with having task positive tendencies or socio-emotional
               tendencies, respectively. This primary reference appeared to impact their decisions
               around whether to act on and stay engaged in an activity. The tendency to gravitate
               toward a self-referent or an other-referent position may indicate that there are two
               different categorical perspectives of, or possibly a continuum from, a task to socio-emotional
               orientation that correlates to an individual's reference. Individuals that are more
               self-referent appear to frame their decisions and determine their desire to act and
               engage based on how it impacts, affects or connects to them, personally. Other-referent
               individuals appear to be more motivated to act or commit if the decision or objective
               is framed in relation to its impact on others.

               of which include extrinsic motivation. Autonomous motivation combines extrinsic and
               intrinsic factors that impact the identification of the activities value whereas controlled
               motivation is driven by extrinsic rewards or punishment; in both cases, they are in

               motivator such that by encouraging rewards and independent action, leaders can transfer
               control to followers and increase their self-determination and feelings of efficacy
               (Tuckey et al.,

               through value and rewards that are meaningful to the individual may be very motivating
               for some, not all high performing senior leaders are motivated by self-rewards and
               self-value. The same company vision may be internalized differently based on one's
               primary reference. Self-determination theory is supported by the task positive group
               who appear to connect with personal value and rewards. Yet some people, as indicated
               by the socio-emotional group, may actually be more motivated if the message is put
               into the perspective of the greater good, or how they could inspire others, taking
               it out of a reward and self-value perspective.

               by the actual goal or milestone, whereas socio-emotional individuals appear to focus
               on the purpose of the activity and the tasks or goals are only a means to a bigger
               objective. The task positive leaders appeared to analyze the measurable result or

               Their research points to an empathetic vs. analytical tension, indicating people are
               driven by emotional or cognitive reasoning. My second finding of a noticeable segregation
               of motivation between being task driven and socio-emotionally driven may support this
               theory; possibly adding an additional dimension. Some leaders appear to analytically
               evaluate the objective to determine their ability to accomplish the task at hand,
               whereas others emotionally evaluate their ability to inspire others to achieve a greater
               good. Individuals who are driven by the task appear to review the goal analytically,
               to determine the degree to which tangible acknowledgement of their accomplishments
               will come through via a sense of productivity or validation. Socio-emotional individuals
               appear to be passionate about the overarching purpose and motivated by something bigger
               than themselves, often other focused, which may not provide tangible or immediate
               results. For them, it is personal and they are motivated and engaged when they are
               able to inspire others to help make a difference in the overarching objective. It
               may be that this desire to help or inspire others to join a cause is motivated by
               empathy, in which case this task driver vs. purpose driver tendency supports the framework
               of the empathetic and analytical tensions. If the motivation is determined to be because
               of an alignment to a greater purpose—a goal with a longer perspective with measurements
               for success, albeit less obvious—this group may be processing their decisions through
               both an analytical and empathetic lens, possibly extending the framework of the empathetic
               and analytical tension theory. This data supports the need to have additional dimensions
               beyond the intrinsic and extrinsic tension such as the tensions proposed by Boyatzis

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">There appears to be a noticeable difference in the temporal perspective of the decisions
               being made by people who are task positive vs. socio-emotional. Decisions appear to
               be made based on either the immediate task (transaction) or because the decision is
               foundational to transforming or achieving a greater, longer term objective. This theme
               seems to impact why one makes the decisions he or she makes based on the locus of
               time used in reference to the goal or objective, e.g., one-off, task specific or a
               greater, longer term purpose orientation. This speaks to the time element that impacts
               the thought process behind the creation of goals referenced previously (Snyder, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">

                  </sup>
               </span>). From the work on self-efficacy done by Bandura, people are motivated by the level
               of personal satisfaction they have around their ability to perform. This intrinsic
               motivation is sustained through the achievement of sub goals that connect to larger
               future goals (Bandura, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">

                  </sup>
               </span>). Bandura is also referencing the temporal element and how it impacts the desire
               to accomplish tasks or sub goals in order to achieve the bigger objective.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The transactional vs. transformational leadership model has been used by practitioners
               to understand how to move their employees beyond a state of self-interest to a shared
               vision by providing meaning and purpose to their work. The underpinning is that a
               transformational leadership style uses inspiration through the connection to a higher
               purpose to motivate and engage followers to achieve a desired performance (Bass, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">

                  </sup>
               </span>). The interpretation of my research indicates that this transformational leadership
               style may not always be better. The style of leadership best deployed may depend on
               where the individual falls on the continuum between being transactional or transformational.
               This supports the assertions summarized by Kowal Smith (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">

               Our possible contribution to this body of work is that a person who appears to be
               more transactional would prefer the aspirational vision to be translated into milestones,
               tasks or goals that, upon completion, would move the individual toward the desired
               end state. A transactional perspective's preference would be to clearly see the end
               goal on the horizon. A more transformational person would flourish under an inspirational
               approach of aligning around a meaningful purpose, and being given flexibility to work
               around, through or even without specific goals.

            <h3>Life work integration vs. separation</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Task-positive and socio-emotional people seem to look at the integration or separation
               of work and life differently which appears to be connected to how they process decisions
               to act or engage. This finding seems to speak to the role their personal purpose or
               personal goals plays in creating alignment with that of the organization and how integrated
               their work is with the other aspects of their life. Dik and Duffy (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">

               </span>) established the construct calling as including an external summons to a higher purpose
               and an alignment to a personal purpose that is other focused, or an advancement of
               a greater good. “A calling is a transcendent summons, experienced as originating beyond
               the self, to approach a particular life role in a manner oriented toward demonstrating
               or deriving a sense of purpose or meaningfulness and that holds other-oriented values
               and goals as primary sources of motivation” (Dik and Duffy, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">
                  <sup>
                     <a href="#B27">2009</a>
                  </sup>
               </span>, p. 427). One implication of their view is that individuals connect their work activity
               to their overall sense of purpose and meaning, or pursue careers that allow their
               work to be their calling. In either case, this implies an integration of work and
               life as one's vocation becomes a tool to accomplish their aspirational purpose. This
               desire to achieve a personal purpose creates motivation that extends beyond the office.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">My research indicates that alignment to visions may exist in two very different ways,
               either as an alignment to a vision, or purpose, or support of personal goals. It may
               not be necessary to inspire people to see the greater good, or to stretch beyond themselves
               to be motivated, engaged and aligned with a higher purpose vision. Some people can
               have a personal purpose that is best described in a goal oriented fashion that is
               very instrumental in helping a company achieve its higher purpose vision, with a comfortable
               separation between work and life. At the end of the day, they will help the organization
               achieve its goal because they feel aligned to the company's vision even though they
               have a deep desire to keep their personal ambitions and the goals of the company separate.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">People often choose a lower income to work in the not-for-profit world for personal
            reasons. This desire to be a part of something bigger, to make a difference, is something
            organizations may be able to tap into if their company vision is aligned with an employee's
            personal ambitions. Once this phenomenon is understood, it can be translated into
            a language that would help organizations understand how to harness this personal drive
            and intrinsic motivation.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The engagement and motivation of individuals who have a personal purpose or personal
            goals that can be accomplished through the work they do for an organization appears
            to be powerful and, once understood, could lead to a more flexible and personalized
            style of leadership. If an organization has a higher purpose vision that attracts
            employees with a vision symbiotic with that of the business, many of the traditional
            forms of external motivation may not be appropriate. By understanding why and what
            motivates task oriented vs. socio-emotional people to make decisions, a leader can
            apply the levers that trigger self-motivation instead of relying on a one size fits
            all.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A leader could increase motivation and engagement by providing alignment, resources
            and support in the form and perspective best understood and desired by each employee,
            then stepping away and allowing the employee to access and pull from the personal
            drive that comes from achieving their own aspirational purpose or goals in life. Similar
            to the conductor of an orchestra, the leader's primary duties would be to unify the
            organization, set the pace and tempo, and then listen, observe and direct as necessary
            to assure the organization is moving in the right direction. Employees who work for
            an organization that has a higher purpose, and are led by leaders who understand their
            drivers, can feel fulfilled and motivated as they use many of their waking hours to
            work toward their personal calling or purpose. At the end of the day, they can feel
            that their efforts were toward creating and supporting their ideal self, not the “ought
            self”, desired by someone else.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This study does not imply that goal-driven or purpose-driven tendencies are good or
               bad, simply different drivers. I purposefully did not provide clear definitions of
               both terms prior to the interviews in order to not bias the selection of the participants
               or the direction of the responses to the questions. The apparent bias against being
               goal based and various understandings of the meaning of being purpose driven created
               a limitation. I mediated this limitation by using an already existing construct to
               categorize the themes that emerged based on Saldana's approach to allowing conceptual
               frameworks to emerge in the coding process and therefore, identifying groups associated
               with these frameworks (Saldaña,

                  </sup>
               </span>). I used the first question to place people into groups that were defined by prior
               research on the topic of motivational drivers. I recommend that it be verified through
               another study that provides more clarification on the difference between the two drivers.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A fourth limitation is that all of the interviews were done with people in leadership
               positions. I recommend that a similar study be done of individuals not in leadership
               positions to understand if that variable impacts the findings.

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Purpose and goals appear to play a role in alignment to visions, motivation and engagement.
            High performing leaders are able to articulate and understand the symbiotic nature
            of their purpose or personal goals with that of the organization, yet how they frame
            their motivation and engagement is different depending on their orientation.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">By understanding the roles personal purpose and goals play in alignment to company
            vision, motivation and engagement, a leader can apply the levers that trigger self-motivation.
            Additional research in this area could break the code to helping leaders increase
            motivation and engagement through alignment, and by providing resources and support
            in the form and perspective best understood and desired by each employee, allowing
            the leader to then step away as employees access and pull from the personal drive
            that comes from achieving their own aspirational purpose or goals in life.
