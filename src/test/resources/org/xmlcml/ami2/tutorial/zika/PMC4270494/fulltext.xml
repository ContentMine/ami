Most patients are viremic when they present with symptoms, and early diagnosis of dengue is important in preventing severe clinical complications associated with this disease and also represents a key factor in differential diagnosis. Here, we designed and validated a hydrolysis-probe-based one-step real-time RT-PCR assay that targets the genomes of dengue virus serotypes 1&#x02013;4.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>The primers and probe used in our RT-PCR assay were designed to target the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of all complete genome sequences of dengue virus available in GenBank (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3,305). Performance of the assay was evaluated using in vitro transcribed RNA, laboratory-adapted virus strains, external control panels, and clinical specimens. The linear dynamic range was found to be 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>11</sup> GCE/mL, and the detection limit was between 6.0&#x000d7;10<sup>2</sup> and 1.1&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> GCE/mL depending on target sequence. The assay did not cross-react with human RNA, nor did it produce false-positive results for other human pathogenic flaviviruses or clinically important etiological agents of febrile illnesses. We used clinical serum samples obtained from returning travelers with dengue-compatible symptomatology (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;163) to evaluate the diagnostic relevance of our assay, and laboratory diagnosis performed by the RT-PCR assay had 100% positive agreement with diagnosis performed by NS1 antigen detection. In a retrospective evaluation including 60 archived serum samples collected from confirmed dengue cases 1&#x02013;9 days after disease onset, the RT-PCR assay detected viral RNA up to 9 days after appearance of symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The validation of the RT-PCR assay presented here indicates that this technique can be a reliable diagnostic tool, and <italic>hence</italic> we suggest that it be introduced as the method of choice during the first 5 days of dengue symptoms.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Dengue is the most common mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans, with an estimated 100 million cases annually. Being able to achieve early and correct detection of all four serotypes of dengue virus can have an impact on the diagnosis of individual patients, such as febrile travelers returning home, but can also be useful in endemic countries, particularly during the early stage of an outbreak. After analyzing all the complete genome sequences of dengue virus serotypes 1 to 4 published in GenBank, we constructed a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay that can be used in different settings to detect dengue virus in clinical samples. Extensive evaluation of the performance of this assay by testing samples from dengue patients confirmed the usefulness of the method in detecting early stage infection. In short, our dengue virus RT-PCR proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool and a relevant alternative and/or complement to NS1 antigen-detecting tests and serological methods for diagnosis of acute dengue.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors are grateful to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) for financial support.

DENV has a positive-stranded RNA genome and belongs to the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. The geographical areas in which DENV circulates have expanded in recent years, and all four serotypes are now found in Asia, Africa, and the Americas <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Guzman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Endemic dengue has been reported from more than 100 countries <xref rid="pntd.0003416-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, many of which are popular tourist destinations. Thus diagnostic challenges include both patients residing in endemic countries and travelers returning home with fever after visiting such regions.</p><p>Most DENV infections are asymptomatic or are manifested by a sudden onset of fever 4 to 6 days after infection <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Guzman2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> that is accompanied by nonspecific signs and symptoms such as nausea, headache, rash, and muscle and joint pain, without any severe sequelae <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Low1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, some patients develop dengue with severe symptoms, which was formerly termed dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This critical phase begins at defervescence and is characterized by plasma leakage leading to respiratory distress and shock, internal hemorrhage, and organ impairment, manifestations that can have a deadly outcome if proper clinical management is delayed <xref rid="pntd.0003416-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Infection with one serotype confers long-term protective immunity against that particular serotype only, whereas subsequent infection with a heterologous serotype may predispose a person to develop severe disease <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Zompi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It is not fully understood why some individuals resolve DENV infections without any complications, whereas others develop severe symptoms, and no single factor has yet been identified as the sole contributor to disease severity <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Martina1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It has been suggested that the infecting DENV subtype or strain influences disease outcome <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Steel1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Messer1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, but the genetic characteristics of the infecting virus are currently not taken into account in the management and clinical care of acutely ill patients <xref rid="pntd.0003416-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Considering the broad spectrum of clinical presentations of dengue, as well as the differential diagnosis to other diseases, laboratory confirmation is essential. Fever is the most common presenting symptom and often coincides with viremia <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Gubler1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigenemia <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Moi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Tricou1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. NS1 is a soluble protein, and it has been shown to be present in serum for up to nine days after onset of fever in a proportion of DENV-1 infected patients <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Alcon1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and is therefore the target for several diagnostic tests. Ever since these assays were introduced, they have been widely used for early dengue diagnosis <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Fry1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003416-Muller1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Unfortunately, recent evaluations have shown that although the NS1 antigen detection tests offer high specificity <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Hang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Andries1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, they differ markedly in sensitivity <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Hang1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Bessoff1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003416-Ramirez1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Serological diagnosis is usually achieved by detecting DENV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies, which start to appear during the early post-febrile period <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Halstead1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A primary infection is characterized by slow and low-titer antibody responses, and IgM antibodies represent the dominant isotype. IgM antibodies appear by day 2 to 5 of illness <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Chanama1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Matheus1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, whereas IgG antibodies generally become detectable at the end of the first week after onset of symptoms <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Guzman1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The opposite is typically observed in secondary infections: IgM antibody levels are undetectable or low, and IgG antibody titers rise rapidly <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Chanama1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Consequently, laboratory diagnosis based entirely on detection of IgM antibodies can give false-negative results in patients that have previously been infected with DENV <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Chanama1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Unspecific reactions are also an important issue to consider in dengue serodiagnosis. Commercially available tests for rapid detection of IgM antibodies have been shown to produce false-positive results in sera positive for anti-DENV IgG, malaria, and rheumatoid factor <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Hunsperger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, and assays detecting anti-DENV IgG antibodies can be vulnerable to cross-reactions caused by antibodies against related viruses <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Guzman2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Due to the mentioned limitations of the conventional assays, the use of molecular methods to detect viral genomes for early diagnosis of dengue has increased. Several specific and sensitive PCR-based assays have been developed during the past years <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Waggoner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003416-Huhtamo1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and one DENV serotype-specific multiplex real-time RT-PCR has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in clinical settings <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Santiago1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Some of those assays are less sensitive gel-based PCR methods <xref rid="pntd.0003416-SanchezSeco1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Lanciotti1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, whereas there are other techniques such as the multiplex real-time RT-PCR that require advanced thermal cyclers that detect the four specific fluorophores for which these systems have been validated <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Waggoner2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Santiago1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The common denominator for most of these assays is the large number of primers and/or probes that are needed to detect the genomes of the four DENV serotypes <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Waggoner1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Waggoner2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, which may complicate modifications of primer and probe sequences when new genetic variants of DENV emerge. Accordingly, we developed a new universal DENV RT-PCR assay that has a single fluorophore-labeled hydrolysis probe and three primers, and represents a system designed to target the 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR) of all complete genome sequences (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3,305) of the four DENV serotypes that have been published thus far. We used in vitro transcribed RNA, laboratory-adapted virus strains, external control panels, and clinical samples to evaluate the DENV RT-PCR assay, and the results showed that the method is highly sensitive and specific for early diagnosis of suspected dengue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement and clinical specimens</title><p>Serum samples were obtained from the biobank repository of the Public Health Agency of Sweden (formerly the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control) as stipulated in the regulations for use of such material in diagnostic development and quality assessment.

These results strongly suggest a false-positive result in the NS1 antigen test.</p><p>Three samples tested negative for IgM antibodies but were positive for viral RNA and IgG antibodies (titers 40, 40, and 2,860; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003416-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), which implies secondary infections or false-negative results in the IgM capture ELISA. Eleven serum samples were found to be positive for DENV IgM antibodies, although no other method could confirm an acute dengue infection. The low specificity of commercial IgM tests has been highlighted in a previous study in which false-positive results were observed in samples from both patients with other infections and healthy donors <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Blacksell1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p><p>To summarize, in six acutely ill patients who would not have been confirmed as having dengue based on analysis of their first serum sample by use of the diagnostic algorithm applied in our laboratory (i.e., positive in two out of three tests), the virus was detected by our DENV RT-PCR assay. One of these DENV RT-PCR-positive patients also had detectable IgG antibody levels, four were also positive for NS1 antigen but not IgG or IgM, and the sixth patient was negative in all other tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003416-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These six samples were confirmed DENV positive using the CDC DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR Assay, whereof two contained DENV-2, two contained DENV-3, and two samples contained DENV-4.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Diagnostic application</title><p>The DENV RT-PCR assay was further evaluated using 60 archived serum samples that were collected in 2012 and 2013 from returning travelers for whom a dengue diagnosis was confirmed and the day of disease onset was reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003416-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

To determine the approximate virus levels in samples collected 1&#x02013;9 days after symptoms appeared, we included a standard containing 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>8</sup> GCE/mL RNA[DENV_R1&#x02013;3] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003416-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

Furthermore, the DENV RT-PCR assay detected viral RNA in all samples up to 5 days after disease onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd-0003416-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), and a detection rate of at least 70% has previously been reported for RT-PCR in this time interval <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Moi1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Waggoner2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Lindegren1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.

Similar to the results presented in 2008 by Dumoulin et al. <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Dumoulin1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, we were unable to detect DENV in samples obtained 10 days after appearance of symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Here we present an alternative to the more complicated multiplex RT-PCR assays for detection of DENV serotypes 1&#x02013;4. Having the capacity to detect a wide range of genetic DENV variants would enable diagnostic laboratories to resolve traveler-associated infections in non-endemic countries and to quickly respond to outbreaks in endemic countries. However, many laboratories lack proper tools for molecular diagnosis of DENV infection <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Domingo1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Although the vast majority of the patients included in the present study had been infected with DENV in Southeast Asia, some of them were Swedish residents returning from travel in Africa, the Caribbean, and South America, and they were all diagnosed with the virus by use of the DENV RT-PCR assay. This observation strongly indicates that the primers and probe used in our assay target genomes of DENV circulating in different regions. However, the assay has yet to be evaluated in clinical settings in endemic regions where other clinical profiles such as secondary infections may be overrepresented compared to our setting where we almost exclusively diagnose primary infections. Although we did not observe PCR inhibition in our clinical material, it can be valuable to include an inhibitory control <xref rid="pntd.0003416-Dingle1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref> if less preserved samples are to be analyzed using the DENV RT-PCR.</p><p>Finally, the DENV RT-PCR assay showed 100% positive agreement with laboratory diagnosis performed using NS1 antigen detection tests. Viral RNA could be detected in samples obtained up to 5 days after disease onset and in more than half of the samples collected 6 to 9 days after appearance of symptoms. Hence the DENV RT-PCR assay is the method of choice during the first 5 days of disease, but after that period it should be supplemented with serology-based techniques.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003416.s001"><label>S1 Figure</label><caption><p><bold>DENV genome sequence diversity.</bold> Variability plot showing the percentage of sequences that deviate from the majority consensus at each nucleotide position.

Perfect match (grey) corresponds to no mismatches in the primers or probe. Mild mismatches (green) corresponds to one or a few mismatches near the 5&#x02032; end of primers and perfect match to the probe. Moderate mismatches (yellow) corresponds to one or a few mismatches in nucleotides not positioned in the 3&#x02032; region of the primer and maximum one mismatch in the probe. Severe mismatch (red) corresponds to one mismatch close to the 3&#x02032; end in primers, several evenly distributed mismatches in the primer, or two mismatches in the probe. Fatal mismatch (blue) corresponds to mismatch in the final nucleotide in the 3&#x02032; end of primers or three or more mismatches in the probe. A) Of 1125 DENV-1 sequences covering the complete amplicon, seven have one mismatch in the probe. Two sequences (GenBank acc. no.

B) Of 958 DENV-2 sequences covering the complete amplicon, eight have one mismatch in the probe, none of the sequences have more than one mismatch. C) Of the 797 DENV-3 sequences covering the complete amplicon, one has one mismatch in the probe. One sequence (GenBank acc. no. JQ922554), collection date 1963, has two mismatches in the probe. D) Of the 141 DENV-4 sequences covering the complete amplicon, one has one mismatch in the probe.
