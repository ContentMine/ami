         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Each year, hundreds of millions of people travel across international borders or even
            oceans, and up to 230 million may remain for long periods. Among these, 3–5 million
            settle permanently in their new homes, with about 1 million migrating permanently
            to the United States of America. This may result in transport of parasites and other
            pathogens, which might become established, infecting individuals in the new location.
            Beyond concern of disease spread, the health of migrants is of concern since the rigors,
            circumstances, and living conditions surrounding migrations may increase the vulnerability
            of migrants to infections. International adoptees and refugees are a small subset
            of these migrants but are of special significance inasmuch as adoptees may be more
            vulnerable to infection due to their immature immune status, and refugees may be more
            vulnerable due to substandard living conditions. Both originate from diverse regions,
            but often from environments of low hygiene and health care standards. This review
            examines recent examples of infections reported from adoptees and refugees entering
            the USA through 2010, highlighting the most common origin countries and the diseases
            most frequently involved, including Chagas disease, 
            <i>Balamuthia</i> amebic meningoencephalitis, giardiasis, microsporidiosis, hepatitis, measles, pertussis,
            tuberculosis, malaria, intestinal helminths, and syphilis.

         <h2>1. Background</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In the past few decades, international adoptions and refugee cases have become increasingly
            common within the United States of America (USA or US). Between 1989 and 2000, US
            citizens adopted approximately 18,846 children from China alone, and the annual increase
            in adoptions is significant [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. For example, US citizens adopted 20,099 children from 20 countries in 2002 compared
            with only 7,093 international adoption cases in 1990 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This increase in permanent relocation between countries and cultures introduces
            a series of significant concerns for the health of both the immigrants and the US
            public at large. While this appears to be a general trend, however, it is important
            to note that levels of both international adoption and admission of international
            refugees are not always positive and fluctuate in response to national and international
            pressures. In this review, we do not attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of
            US immigration policies regarding refugees and adoptees. This report is intended to
            examine the general issues, highlighting some representative recent examples from
            specific localities.

         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">It is estimated that approximately 2% of the world's population resides in a nation
            other than the one in which they were born [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Although globalization has several positive consequences, it has also become a
            great concern as increased technology and economic means have afforded larger populations
            with access to intercontinental travel, and along with it the capacity to spread diseases
            rapidly on a global scale [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The resulting displaced, foreign-born population composed of immigrants, refugees,
            and adoptees not only experiences a shift in their personal health experience, but
            also impacts the health environments of the new communities into which they come to
            reside. Two of the most important factors directly relating to the epidemiology of
            disease due to migrations are the “degree of difference between origin and the destination”
            and the “size of the mobile population that moves between the different disease prevalence
            patterns” [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Although they comprise relatively small populations, foreign-born adopted children
            and international refugees may potentially play a significant role in the globalization
            of some infectious diseases. Not only have their numbers grown considerably in size
            in the past few decades, but they also represent populations migrating to considerable
            distances across diverse epidemiological regions, thus making them of increased relevance
            in the study of infectious disease.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">However, it is important to note that the well-being of these legally accepted migrant
            populations is highly regulated and monitored in the USA, such that data comparing
            their infections with those of other migrant populations are not readily available
            at present. These populations are often overrepresented in epidemiological studies
            of the foreign-born migrants, simply because the administrative and legal requirements
            of their status generate data. The larger and nationally more significant foreign-born
            populations (including lawful permanent residents as well as undocumented/unlawful
            residents) are almost certain to have greater epidemiological impact. Nevertheless,
            while adoptees and refugees make up a relatively small component of overall US permanent
            immigrants, to ensure optimal health for them as well as their new neighbors, there
            is a need for vigilance regarding the pathogens and parasites associated with their
            migrations.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines new and
            reemerging infectious diseases as “diseases of infectious origin whose incidence in
            humans has increased within the past two decades or threatens to increase in the near
            future” [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The emergence of an infectious disease is dependent upon the introduction of a
            disease-causing agent into a new population, reinforced by the disease's establishment
            and proliferation into the new region [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. While developed nations have achieved complete or relatively high success in controlling
            most infectious disease transmission, underdeveloped nations are still struggling
            with the means to control and treat such diseases, or to provide preventative care.
            Most developed countries do not routinely perform screening for many nonendemic infections
            potentially arriving from abroad, so that the probability of spreading of such diseases
            increases. Foreign children awaiting adoption by parents in another country are often
            exposed to a variety of infectious diseases due to inferior standards for immunization
            practices and lack of preventative care within the health care systems of some underdeveloped
            countries. Within the close confines of an orphanage, transmission of infectious diseases
            including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, measles, intestinal parasites, bacterial pathogens,
            and various viruses has been observed between children and caretakers. Studies have
            shown that “infants and young children who are brought together in groups for care
            have a higher rate of infection, greater severity of illness, and increased risk for
            acquisition of resistant organisms” [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Furthermore, these same diseases, often untreated before departure from the originating
            country, are brought into the homes of adoptive parents and caretakers, who thus experience
            increased risk of exposure to foreign pathogens, potentially leading to new or reemerging
            cases of infectious disease.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As with international adoptees, international refugees have come to form a relatively
            small, yet significant, population within the United States. Refugees can be defined
            as “individuals who are outside their country and cannot return because of a well-founded
            fear of persecution related to their race, religion, and political or social affiliations”
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Like the foreign-born adopted child population, the number of international refugees
            has also greatly increased in recent decades. In the 1960s, the world refugee population
            was approximately 1 million, and yet in 2003 it had rapidly grown to include 11.9
            million people [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The conditions to which this unique population is exposed before departure, during
            transit, and after arrival in destination camps afford them little or no health care
            and an increased risk of infectious disease. Between 1979 and 2004, 75,000 refugees
            settled in the US state of Minnesota alone, and thousands more established residence
            throughout the United States. All of this has the potential to impact the epidemiology
            of infectious diseases in the communities in which they have newly settled [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The growing refugee population, combined with frequently unsanitary conditions
            and inadequate hygiene, makes this a group of particular concern.

            in this arena of public health and thus to identify a potential trajectory of dissemination
            of infectious disease into and across the United States. The goal of this review and
            analysis is to explore the overall effect international adoption and international
            refugee cases have on the accidental importation of infectious diseases into the United
            States. The primary objective was to compile a list of some of the more important
            infectious diseases known to be introduced through international adoptees and refugees.
            We also provide a comparison of these two populations with particular emphasis on
            age and country of origin, using data available through the end of the past decade
            in 2010.

            which general trends were identified. Although treatment is not always sufficiently
            provided or documented before departure for adopted children or refugees, physical
            exams and health assessments performed after arrival provide useful data for determining
            prevalence of specific diseases within these incoming populations. For example, “all
            refugees to the United States are encouraged to obtain a health assessment at local
            public health departments within ninety days of arrival” [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The documentation of such visits provides a substantial basis from which to gauge
            accounts of old, latent, active, or previous exposure to infectious diseases.

            sizes than those for refugees but were still viewed as informative. Specific case
            studies involving few or even one patient are relevant, as such children could serve
            as the primary source for a foreign infectious disease within US borders. Such studies
            serve as indicators of potential emerging infectious diseases.

            representative perspective on the potential risk these two specific populations endure
            under common circumstances. From this, comparisons were made between the two groups
            to assess the relative degrees of risk and occurrence of infectious disease.

         <h2>2. Basic Assumptions</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A staggering 700 million annual human migrations affect residents of recipient localities
            on both a macro and micro level [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Globalization has certainly contributed to economic growth and diversification
            of populations, but perhaps more importantly, it has also opened up numerous avenues
            for infectious diseases to be transported along with international adoptees, immigrants,
            refugees, and tourists.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">While it may be expected that immigrants and tourists should have access to basic
            health care, the environments from which most adoptees and refugees come tend to be
            substandard, and these populations usually stay in the United States for extended
            periods of time. Orphanages in embattled countries struggling with political unrest
            and lack of governmental health programs suffer from inferior standards for sanitation,
            protection, immunization practices, and preventative treatment. For these reasons,
            this study focuses on the rise of infectious disease due to international adoptees
            and refugees. In this brief review, it was a basic assumption that exposures to both
            adoptee and refugee populations serve as sources of transmission for infectious diseases,
            which potentially leads to an increase in endemic levels of infectious disease in
            the new home localities. Of the two populations, international refugees were assumed
            to present a higher risk due to the higher population numbers and the greater chance
            of inferior health care once displaced into camps. It might be argued that due to
            lack of extensive study there is a paucity of direct evidence to support these assumptions.
            In fact, considering the numbers of individuals arriving from locations with greater
            risks and exposure to infections of low prevalence in the USA, there is only limited
            evidence of transmission to the host population. Postarrival transmission, when it
            occurs, frequently may be more common among the foreign-born population [

            directly communicable diseases, with little information on the more complicated transmission
            of vector-borne or other indirectly transmitted diseases.

            relocating to the US. Some of these include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, SARS,

            ectoparasites such as scabies mites and lice. The Yale International Adoption Clinic
            Experience data demonstrate that adoptees “are at risk for infections well known to

            a 2007 report illustrates 5 cases (19%) in adoptees, 2 (7%) in unvaccinated travelers,

            <i> Giardia</i> does not remain in check, the endemic level could be heightened within the United
            States borders as illustrated in a 2005 analysis by Ekdahl and Andersson, which demonstrated
            the change in the epidemiology of giardiasis within Sweden. Data taken from the Swedish
            national database confirmed that 4,151 cases of
            <i> Giardia</i> in newly arrived immigrants and refugees and 455 cases in internationally adopted
            children were imported and thus disseminated within the country's borders [

            </span>]. This substantial transfer of
            <i> Giardia</i> resulted in a substantially greater calculated risk for being diagnosed with giardiasis.
            According to Ekdahl and Andersson, “in comparable countries, the calculated risk for
            being notified with giardiasis was 3–30 times higher in immigrant and refugees than
            in tourists and 2–5 times higher in adopted children than in immigrants and refugees”

            it is advisable to call attention to the need to develop public health measures against
            travelers and immigrants with this disease.

            United States Department of State allocates refugee resettlements into the United
            States based upon global region. These regions are divided as Africa, East Asia, Europe
            and Central Asia, Latin America/Caribbean, and Near East/South Asia. Each year, the
            US Department of State publishes the proposed ceiling for refugee admissions by region
            for the coming fiscal year and the realized values for the previous one. The breakdown
            for 2009 is shown in 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>. These data are essential to the study of the globalization of infectious diseases.
            A total of 74,654 refugees entered the United States in 2009, all of them from areas
            with diverse epidemiological fingerprints [

            within these refugee populations, we recommend increasing vigilance and surveillance
            among large immigrations from various regions of the world, as these are points of

         <h2>4. Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This compilation of data shows that both internationally adopted children and international
            refugees pose significant potential for infectious disease to be brought into the
            United States. The infectious diseases commonly transmitted between these two populations
            are very similar, but the sheer difference in the number of international refugees
            in comparison to foreign-born adopted children makes the most prevalent diseases of
            the refugees a greater concern. The poor conditions and frequent lack of medical treatment
            also contribute to the potential for these diseases to persist and spread among these
            populations, as they often live in close confinement, and therefore allow greater
            opportunity for transmission. Families providing homes for international adoptees
            often have greater access to health care and the means to receive medical attention
            more quickly than their new wards had in the locality of origin. Nevertheless, each
            member of these two groups of immigrants has the potential to serve as a source of
            importation of infectious disease.

            the political climate of the region as well as the country's social and economic conditions
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Despite mandates that children up for adoption must be subjected to predeparture
            health screening, Hostetter et al. demonstrated in 1989 that 54% of the adopted children
            they screened once arriving to the United States had an undiagnosed infectious disease
            at the time of visiting a practitioner; 63% were diagnosed with an unsuspected medical
            problem regardless of country of origin [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B29">28</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Since their study was published, the number of international adoptions and the
            number of international refugees given admission into the United States have increased,
            and unfortunately, the data presented in this review do not demonstrate that predeparture
            detection methods of infectious disease have improved proportionally. However, it
            is also important to note that not all refugees arrive from refugee camps, and, for
            those that do, frequently camp medical services, access to care, and predeparture
            treatment may exceed the levels of local health services in their country of origin.
            This is clearly the case for many refugees bound for the USA, where CDC-directed treatment
            programs screen and treat several infections and infestations of public health importance
            prior to departure.

            emerging in human populations in various parts of the world from which adoptees and
            refugees regularly migrate to the United States and other countries where those parasites
            have not yet been recorded but possess characteristics that would allow their colonization
            of these new localities [

               </sup>
            </span>]. An example is the current rapid emergence and spread of canine-associated dirofilariasis
            caused by
            <i> Dirofilaria repens</i>, throughout Eurasia, and especially in Eastern Europe [

               </sup>
            </span>]. The
            <i> Aedes</i> mosquito vectors of this disease and diverse canid reservoirs are present in areas
            of the United States to which adoptees and refugees might move. The same mosquitoes,
            currently within the US, are also able to transmit such viral pathogens as dengue,
            Chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever, so that health officials as well as entomologists
            and vector biologists in both the origination and recipient countries should be alert
            to the possibility of such dissemination.
