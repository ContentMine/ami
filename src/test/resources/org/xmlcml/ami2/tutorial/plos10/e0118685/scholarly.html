      <p>Ectromelia virus (ECTV) causes mousepox in mice, a disease very similar to smallpox
         in humans. ECTV and variola virus (VARV), the agent of smallpox, are closely related
         orthopoxviruses. Mousepox is an excellent small animal model to study the genetic
         and immunologic basis for resistance and susceptibility of humans to smallpox. Resistance
         to mousepox is dependent on a strong polarized type 1 immune response, associated
         with robust natural killer (NK) cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and gamma interferon
         (IFN-γ) responses. In contrast, ECTV-susceptible mice generate a type 2 response,
         associated with weak NK cell, CTL and IFN-γ responses but robust IL-4 responses. Nonetheless,
         susceptible strains infected with mutant ECTV lacking virus-encoded IFN-γ binding
         protein (vIFN-γbp) (ECTV-IFN-γbp
         <sup>Δ</sup>) control virus replication through generation of type 1 response. Since the IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6
         signaling pathways polarize type 2/T helper 2 (Th2) responses with a corresponding
         suppression of IFN-γ production, we investigated whether the combined absence of vIFN-γbp,
         and one or more host genes involved in Th2 response development, influence generation
         of protective immunity. Most mutant mouse strains infected with wild-type (WT) virus
         succumbed to disease more rapidly than WT animals. Conversely, the disease outcome
         was significantly improved in WT mice infected with ECTV-IFN-γbp
         <sup>Δ</sup> but absence of IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways did not provide any added advantage.
         Deficiency in IL-13 or STAT-6 resulted in defective CTL responses, higher mortality
         rates and accelerated deaths. Deficiencies in IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways
         significantly reduced the numbers of IFN-γ producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, indicating
         an absence of a switch to a Th1-like response. Factors contributing to susceptibility
         or resistance to mousepox are far more complex than a balance between Th1 and Th2
         responses.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Smallpox was one of the biggest human scourges when it was rife, with mortality rates
         of 30–40%. VARV is an orthopoxvirus (OPV) that causes smallpox, a disease that has
         killed more humans than all other infectious diseases combined [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref001">1</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref004">4</span>]. As the disease was eradicated more than 30 years ago, animal models of OPV infections
         have been used to establish strong causal relationships and map the requirements for
         protection against infection in a way that is not possible in humans. ECTV is a natural
         pathogen of mice that causes a generalized infection known as mousepox, an excellent
         small animal model to study the pathogenesis of smallpox [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref004">4</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref007">7</span>]. Both VARV and ECTV cause acute infections in their respective hosts, which either
         succumb to infection or clear the virus with complete recovery.
      </p>
      <p>Resistance to mousepox is dependent on rapid generation of a strong polarized type
         1 immune response [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref008">8</span>]. ECTV-resistant C57BL/6 mice generate robust NK cell, CTL, and IFN-γ responses whereas
         in ECTV-susceptible BALB/c mice these responses are sub-optimal but high levels of
         IL-4 is produced. Loss of IFN-γ function in resistant mice [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref009">9</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref010">10</span>] or over-expression of IL-4 by recombinant ECTV encoding IL-4, which abrogates IFN-γ
         production [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref011">11</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref012">12</span>] results in ineffective NK cell and CTL responses and fulminant disease. The existence
         of virus-encoded host response modifiers that specifically target type 1 cytokines
         further underscores the importance of these factors in immunity to poxvirus infections
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref013">13</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref016">16</span>]. Indeed, BALB/c mice infected with a deletion mutant virus lacking vIFN-γbp (ECTV-IFN-γbp
         <sup>Δ</sup>) are able to contain virus replication and overcome the infection [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref017">17</span>]. Absence of vIFN-γbp increases IFN-γ production and as a consequence, augments cell-mediated
         immunity and virus control.
      </p>
      <p>The cytokine milieu and cell subset-selective transcription factors play important
         roles in the differentiation of uncommitted naive CD4 T cells into Th1 and Th2 subsets
         following antigenic stimulation [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref018">18</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref019">19</span>]. IFN-γ and IL-4 play dominant roles in the development of Th1 and Th2 subsets, respectively.
         IL-4 mediates its activity through the IL-4 receptor (R), which consists of a heterodimeric
         complex between IL-4Rα and the common γ chain [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref020">20</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref021">21</span>]. IL-4Rα also associates with the low affinity IL-13Rα1 to form a high affinity receptor
         for both IL-13 and IL-4. A second IL-13 receptor, IL-13Rα2, which exists in a monomeric
         form, can bind to IL-13 with high affinity and modulate IL-13 responses [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref022">22</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref023">23</span>]. Binding of IL-4 to IL-4R activates the transcription factor STAT-6, which in turn
         controls expression of GATA3, the master transcription regulator required for Th2
         differentiation [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref024">24</span>]. IL-13 is also capable of activating STAT-6 and shares many of the biological properties
         of IL-4.
      </p>
      <p>A previous report pointed to a role for STAT-6 signaling and IL-4 production in contributing
         to susceptibility of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref025">25</span>]. STAT-6 deficient mice infected with ECTV-WT were better protected through generation
         of more effective NK cell and IFN-γ responses that allowed the otherwise susceptible
         animals to overcome infection. Curiously, IL-4 deficiency in BALB/c mice has no impact
         on disease outcome [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref008">8</span>], implying that other factors like IL-13 may be sufficient to drive Th2-like responses
         in the absence of IL-4.
      </p>
      <p>Since the generation of protective immunity and the outcome of a viral infection are
         influenced by both viral and host genes, we hypothesized that infection of gene knockout
         (GKO) BALB/c mice lacking one or more factors associated with Th2 response development
         with ECTV-WT or ECTV-IFN-γbp
         <sup>Δ</sup> would further augment the Th1 response and influence disease outcome. Contrary to
         our prediction, the disease was exacerbated in most groups of BALB/c mice lacking
         one or more components of Th2 signaling pathways compared to WT mice infected with
         WT virus. Conversely, the disease outcome was significantly improved in WT mice infected
         with the mutant virus, but absence of the IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways did
         not provide any added advantage to the host. In fact, there were higher rates of mortality
         and accelerated deaths amongst mice deficient in IL-13 or STAT-6 compared with WT
         animals. Deficiency in IL-13 or STAT-6 dramatically reduced the antiviral CTL response.
         Furthermore, deficiencies in IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways significantly reduced
         the numbers of IFN-γ producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, indicating an absence of a switch
         to a Th1-like response. Thus, although recovery from ECTV infection is strongly influenced,
         in part, by a balance between the host’s ability to produce IFN-γ and the virus’ ability
         to dampen its effects [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref017">17</span>], our data indicate that factors contributing to disease susceptibility are far more
         complex than a balance between Th1 and Th2 responses.

            Absence of one or more factors associated with Th2 response development did not provide

         <p>We interrogated CD4 T cells by flow cytometry to detect expression of intracellular

            <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. vIFN-γbp modulated the IFN-γ response only in STAT-6

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>A type 1/Th1-like cytokine response coupled with robust cell-mediated immunity is
         critical for recovery from mousepox whereas a type 2/Th2-like response associated
         with an absent or weak IFN-γ response and cell-mediated immunity is associated with
         susceptibility [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref008">8</span>]. Deficiency in IFN-γ [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref009">9</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref010">10</span>] or its suppression through over-expression of IL-4 by recombinant ECTV in resistant
         mice results in generation of poor cell-mediated immunity, overcomes resistance to
         mousepox and results in fulminant disease [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref011">11</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref012">12</span>]. While it may be speculated that type 1-like responses were important for recovery
         of humans from smallpox, there is circumstantial evidence that Th2-biased responses
         can significantly exacerbate the disease and result in increased mortality.
      </p>
      <p>In non-vaccinated humans, about 90% of cases were of the ordinary-type smallpox with
         a case fatality rate of about 30–40% [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref035">35</span>]. A more severe form of the disease, hemorrhagic-type smallpox, characterized by
         mucosal and skin hemorrhage, was mainly seen in pregnant women. Early hemorrhagic-type
         smallpox was associated with almost 100% mortality regardless of vaccination status
         and pregnant women with smallpox had 3–4 times higher case fatality rates than non-pregnant
         women and men of the same age groups [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref035">35</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref036">36</span>]. Although the reasons for higher case fatality rates were not known at the time
         when smallpox was endemic, it is now recognized that an immune bias towards a Th2-like
         response associated with pregnancy [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref037">37</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref039">39</span>] may have been responsible. That Th2-biased response can exacerbate smallpox even
         in vaccinated individuals is significant. In this regard, the demonstration that infection
         of previously vaccinated mice with recombinant ECTV encoding IL-4 can completely overcome
         protective immunity and genetic resistance [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref011">11</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref012">12</span>] helped establish that over exuberant Th2-biased responses increase susceptibility
         to OPV infections. This raises the question of whether defective or sub-optimal Th2
         responses allow for the generation of more effective antiviral immunity. Our results
         indicate they do not.
      </p>
      <p>Deficiencies in IL-4, STAT-6, IL-13 and/or IL-4Rα signaling on immune response generation
         were varied and further modulated by vIFN-γbp but 3 broad categories of outcomes were
         evident. In the first, the IL-4
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice had comparable recovery rates to WT mice regardless of whether they were infected
         with WT or mutant virus. In the second, the IL-4Rα
         <sup>−/−</sup> and IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup>/IL-4Rα
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WT virus infection but the absence of
         vIFN-γbp during infection mitigated the increased susceptibility. Finally, mice deficient
         in IL-13 or STAT-6 were significantly more susceptible than WT animals in response
         to WT or mutant virus infection. Susceptibility to ECTV is attributed to uncontrolled
         generalized virus replication in visceral organs, including in the liver [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref006">6</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref007">7</span>], spleen and blood [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref040">40</span>]. However, in the current study, viral load in organs and blood 7 days after infection
         did not consistently correlate with increased susceptibility, with the exception of
         STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice. This outcome is surprising and might have been a consequence of the extent
         to which deficiencies in IL-4, IL-13 and/or IL-4Rα, combined with immunomodulation
         by vIFN-γbp impacted on inflammation, the immune response and virus control. Viral
         load in the liver and spleen generally increase exponentially over time if not effectively
         controlled by the immune response. However, the blood viral load is usually only increased
         following primary, secondary and subsequent occurrence of viremia following release
         of virions from the visceral organs. It is possible that kinetics of virus replication
         in the different GKO mouse strains was different and measurement of viral load at
         a single time-point might not have revealed the extent to which the viruses replicated
         and spread. However, the fact that most GKO mice succumbed to mousepox at or after
         6 days post-infection suggests that measurement of viral titers at day 7 should have
         indicated if uncontrolled virus replication was the cause of death. Another finding
         of note is that deficiency in IL-13 or IL-4Rα resulted in comparable viral titers
         in liver, spleen and blood but titers were lower in the liver and blood in IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup>/IL-4Rα
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice. While the reason for this is unclear, it might be explained, at least in part
         by the CTL responses generated in the absence of IL-13 or both IL-13 and IL-4Rα (see
         below).
      </p>
      <p>Absence of IL-4, STAT-6, IL-13 or IL-4Rα signaling clearly had a significant impact
         on both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, which were modulated to some extent by vIFN-γbp.
         Contrary to our prediction, the numbers of IFN-γ
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as IL-4
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells were decreased in all GKO strains compared to WT mice. Absence of vIFN-γbp
         during infection had minimal effects on CD4 T cell responses with the exception of
         STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice in which mutant virus infection significantly increased IFN-γ
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cell numbers. The most striking reductions in the anti-ECTV CTL responses were
         seen with WT virus infected STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> and IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice, which were almost completely reversed when these strains were infected with
         ECTV-IFN-γbp
         <sup>Δ</sup>. Deficiency in the IL-4Rα alone did not have any impact on the CTL response but in
         the IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice, the significant reduction in CTL activity was partially reversed when IL-4Rα
         was also absent. This is an interesting finding and although the mechanisms involved
         are not known, it suggests that in the absence of IL-13, IL-4 signaling through the
         IL-Rα was far more detrimental to induction of antiviral CTL responses than in the
         complete absence of IL-4 and IL-13 responses in IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup>/IL-4Rα
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice. We speculate that IL-13 might modulate the IL-4 response in induction of ECTV-specific
         CTL responses. Another important finding in the STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice is the complete lack of reactivity of CD8 T cells to any of the H-2d determinants
         that were tested. One explanation for the complete lack of reactivity to the three
         H-2
         <sup>d</sup>-restricted viral determinants in the STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> strain is that the response might have been directed against other determinants.
         It is also possible that results could be influenced by subtle changes in reactivity
         of cells maturing in a STAT-6-deficient environment. Such changes in immune responses
         may be due to altered peptide expression that might be negligible or difficult to
         identify or quantify, but should nonetheless be considered for investigations in our
         future studies. It is curious why Th2-response linked genes influence the reactivity
         of CD8 T responses but may be related, at least in part, to potential defects in antigen
         presentation by dendritic cells as discussed below.
      </p>
      <p>Although IFN-γ impacts on the quality and magnitude of the anti-ECTV CTL response
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref008">8</span>], it was evident that the augmented CTL activity in IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> and STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice was not related to the marginally increased numbers of virus-specific IFN-γ
         <sup>+</sup> CD8 cells, which occurred in all GKO strains. It is also possible that factors other
         than CD8 T cell-derived IFN-γ influenced the cytolytic activity of CTL in IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> and STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice. As CD4 T cells are important for generation of optimal CTL responses to ECTV
         infection [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref041">41</span>], we considered the possibility that IFN-γ-producing CD4 T cells may have impacted
         on the magnitude of CTL responses. While this might have been the case in STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> animals (
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118685.g005">Fig. 5A</span>) in which numbers of IFN-γ
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 cells substantially increased following infection with the mutant virus, it did
         not hold true for the IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice. There is therefore little or no evidence for any consistent correlation between
         the numbers of IFN-γ
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells and the magnitude of the CD8 T cell-mediated CTL responses in individual
         mouse strains.
      </p>
      <p>STAT-6-dependent IL-4 production has been purported to be associated with susceptibility
         of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref025">25</span>] but IL-4 deficiency in BALB/c mice has no impact on disease outcome [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref008">8</span>]. Since IL-4
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice can respond to IL-13, we hypothesized that the cytokine might compensate for
         absence of IL-4 to drive Th2-like responses. Our data established that this was not
         the case and that the responses to, and outcome of infection with, ECTV in IL-4
         <sup>−/−</sup>, IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> and STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup>mice are very different. First, IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> and STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice were far more susceptible to WT or mutant virus infection than IL-4
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice. Second, the CTL response to WT virus was marginally reduced in IL-4
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice compared to WT animals, but the effect was far more significant in IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> and STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice. This is an important and novel finding in that factors normally associated
         with Th2 responses play critical and non-redundant roles in the generation of optimal
         antiviral CD8 CTL responses. The mechanism(s) through which IL-13 or STAT-6 impact
         on CTL responses generation during ECTV infection is currently unknown but merit a
         detailed investigation.
      </p>
      <p>Naïve CD8
         <sup>+</sup> T cells in IL-4
         <sup>−/−</sup>, IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> and STAT6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice express lower levels of IL-4Rα making them less responsive to IL-4 and IL-13
         during T cell priming [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref042">42</span>]. It is therefore possible that in IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice, IL-4 signaling alone through activation of STAT-6 may promote sufficient down-regulation
         of CD8 co-receptor densities on naïve CD8
         <sup>+</sup> T cells following cognate antigen encounter during ECTV infection, and lessen the
         anti-viral capacity of effector CD8
         <sup>+</sup> T cells by reducing avidity and polyfunctionality [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref043">43</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref045">45</span>]. In relation to the role of STAT-6 in CTL responses, it has been reported that the
         activation and function of CTL may be impaired in STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice during infection with the intracellular parasite 
         <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, likely as a consequence of reduced levels of CD86 expression on DC [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref046">46</span>]. The demonstration that activation of CD8 T cells in STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice was restored after transfer of splenic adherent cells or bone-marrow derived
         DC from WT mice whereas transfer of naïve WT CD8 T cells into STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice were not activated suggested a defect in antigen presentation [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref046">46</span>]. It is known that 
         <i>in vitro</i>, IL-13, like IL-4, in combination with GM-CSF can induce generation of functional
         DC [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref047">47</span>], suggesting that IL-13 may be important in differentiation of DC via STAT-6 signaling.
         We speculate that IL-4R/IL-13R-associated STAT-6 signaling might be important in CD8
         T cell activation and function during ECTV infection, possibly through maturation
         of antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC). Apart from promoting the
         expression of several cell surface molecules responsible for antigen presentation;
         including MHC II, CD80, and CD86, IL-4/STAT-6 signaling regulates T-cell proliferation
         by decreasing the expression of p27
         <sup>Kip1</sup>, a known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. In CD8 cells, STAT6 is required for Tc2
         differentiation as the production of IL-4 and IL-5 is completely lost with STAT6 deficiency
         (reviewed in [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref048">48</span>]). Taken together, STAT6 is required for IL-4-stimulated T-cell functions.
      </p>
      <p>That STAT-6 deficiency further exacerbates susceptibility of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection
         is in stark contrast to a previous report in which STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice were found to be more resistant than WT BALB/c mice due to augmented NK cell
         and IFN-γ responses [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref025">25</span>]. In the current study, apart from a 2–3-fold increase in the cytolytic activity
         of NK cells in STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice, all other responses were either far worse or no different to WT mice. We believe
         that there may be a simple explanation for this discrepancy. In the present study
         we used STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice that were backcrossed to the BALB/c background for at least 10 generations [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref029">29</span>]. In the previous study, STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice generated on a 129 background [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref049">49</span>] and backcrossed to the BALB/c background for only 6 generations were used. Given
         that several of the 129 sub-strains are resistant to mousepox [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref010">10</span>], we believe that the 129/Sv background genes may have influenced the outcome of
         infection in that study. It is likely that STAT-6 deficiency in ECTV-resistant C57BL/6
         or 129 mouse strains might further augment Th1 responses but this is not the case
         in the ECTV-susceptible BALB/c mice. Consistent with this proposition, we have found
         that C57BL/6 mice deficient in IL-4 generate more robust CTL and IFN-γ responses which
         correlated with more efficient virus control compared to WT littermate controls (data
         not shown). Furthermore, when the STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice used in the previous study [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref025">25</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref049">49</span>] were backcrossed to the BALB/c background 10–12 times, they were found to be more
         susceptible to ECTV-WT infection than WT littermates (data not shown). Clearly, STAT-6
         deficiency does not increase the resistance of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection. On the
         contrary, STAT-6 deficiency further increased susceptibility of the BALB/c strain
         to ECTV.
      </p>
      <p>Our finding that deficiencies in IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways significantly
         reduced the numbers of IFN-γ producing CD4 and CD8 T cells indicates an absence of
         a switch to a Th1-like response and might be unique to this viral model. For example,
         Th1/Th2 cytokine production by IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> cells is varied depending on 
         <i>in vitro</i> or 
         <i>in vivo</i> stimulation conditions and the type of cells involved [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref027">27</span>]. IL-13 deficient splenocytes or CD4 T cells stimulated with mitogens produce reduced
         levels of IL-4 but similar levels of IFN-γ compared to WT cells. Under Th1/Th2 culture
         conditions, IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> CD4 T cells produce dramatically reduced levels of IL-4 but only a 2-fold higher
         amount of IFN-γ. In contrast, mast cells from IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> and WT mice stimulated with PMA and ionomycin produce comparable levels of IL-4.
         
         <i>In vivo</i>, challenge of IL-13
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice with schistosome eggs reduced IL-4 levels only by about 3-fold whereas challenge
         with the parasite 
         <i>N</i>. 
         <i>brasiliensis</i> had no impact on Th2 response generation or IL-4 production by lymph node cells or
         purified CD4 T cells.
      </p>
      <p>It is conceivable that regulation of Th2 response generation 
         <i>in vivo</i> during infection with a virus is far more complex than how it is understood to occur
         in 
         <i>in vitro</i> culture conditions. Various stimuli, cell types and signalling pathways are involved
         in orchestrating Th2 responses of which there are also variants [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref019">19</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref050">50</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref052">52</span>]. Indeed, Th2 differentiation has been shown to occur in mice that are deficient
         in IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Rα or STAT-6 and cytokines like thymic stromal lymphopoietin,
         IL-25 and IL-33 can induce Th2 responses [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref019">19</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref027">27</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref051">51</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref052">52</span>]. There is consensus, however, that GATA3 is required for this process, even if expressed
         at low levels [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref053">53</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref055">55</span>]. In the current study, we found that numbers of GATA3
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells were highest in both WT and IL-4
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice infected with WT virus but numbers were reduced in the GKO strains. These strains
         also had the highest number of T-bet
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. T-bet can negatively regulate GATA3 [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118685.ref056">56</span>] and in STAT-6
         <sup>−/−</sup> mice, T-bet
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cell numbers were increased with a corresponding decrease in GATA-3
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. These changes, however, did not translate to an increase in IFN-γ
         <sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. Overall, there was little correlation between GATA-3 and IL-4 expression
         or T-bet and IFN-γ expression in CD4 T cells regardless of the type of infecting virus.
         We believe that the use of transgenic CD4 and CD8 T cells, specific for a model antigen,
         and deficient in IL-4, IL-13, IL-4Rα or STAT-6 might help better understand the molecular
         mechanisms involved in driving Th2 responses in BALB/c mice infected with ECTV. The
         adoptive transfer of such transgenic cells into recipient mice combined with the use
         of recombinant ECTV encoding the model antigen for infection is an approach that we
         propose to undertake.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>We have established that deficiency in specific factors associated with Th2 response
         development and/or the absence of vIFN-γ-bp during infection of BALB/c mice with ECTV
         does not bias development of a Th1 response. IL-4, STAT-6 and IL-13, which are normally
         associated with development of Th2 responses, play important and non-redundant roles
         in the generation of optimal antiviral CTL responses. Our data also established that
         the absence of IL-13 and STAT-6 further increased the susceptibility of BALB/c mice
         to ECTV infection. We conclude that host resistance or susceptibility to mousepox
         is far more complex and goes beyond the presence or absence of select genetic factors
         that control Th differentiation.
