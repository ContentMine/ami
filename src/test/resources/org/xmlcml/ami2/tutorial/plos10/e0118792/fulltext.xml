The SI is largely responsible for the digestion and absorption of food while the LI aids in final water absorption and waste removal. Among other signaling pathways, Wnt and Notch control the well-defined epithelial hierarchy in the intestine, helping to maintain stem cell homeostasis. Since these pathways require receptors, ligands and transcriptional regulation, it is unclear whether differences observed between the SI and LI are primarily due to intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Understanding these differences is crucial, since failure of intestinal stem cells to properly proliferate and differentiate may lead to cancer, which is 20 times more prevalent in the LI than the SI in humans [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, a thorough investigation of the origin of the differences between the SI and LI has yet to be done.</p><p>The identification and characterization of stem cells in the intestine has evolved rather rapidly in recent years. <italic>In vivo</italic> lineage tracing studies have identified leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)<sup>+</sup> stem cells in the mouse as cells capable of generating all the epithelial cells of the intestine and forming crypt-like structures <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Interestingly, LGR5 is intricately involved in the synergistic activation of the Wnt pathway, via the R-Spondin protein family, which is responsible for homeostatic crypt formation and maintenance in the intestine [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This pathway is also commonly altered in colon cancer via mutation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), causing an accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus and enhanced Wnt signaling [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Rapidly growing adenomas form in the mouse after deletion of APC in LGR5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells, suggesting that normal stem cells are the cell-of-origin of intestinal cancer [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Additionally, murine adenomas revealed continual LGR5<sup>+</sup> stem cell activity, providing functional evidence of a cancerous stem cell population in primary intestinal adenomas [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The Wnt pathway has extensive cross-talk with the Notch pathway in its control over cell fate decisions, proliferation and tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. More specifically, activation of the Notch pathway represses secretory cell differentiation but inhibition of the Notch pathway leads to activation of atonal homolog 1 (ATOH1) promoting goblet cell differentiation (<xref rid="pone.0118792.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig.</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus far, a majority of studies elucidating these pathways in the intestine have not made clear distinctions between the SI and LI, possibly missing differences with important consequences.</p><p>The majority of intestinal stem cell characterization has been performed in animal models because cells from normal human intestine has been notoriously difficult to grow <italic>in vitro</italic> and lineage tracing cannot be performed practically in humans. To overcome these limitations, we used feeder cells as a stromal layer to provide cell-cell interactions with human intestinal cells and promote epithelial cell growth [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Our lab has previously used this system to isolate and expand tumor cells with stem cell properties (cancer stem cells, CSCs) from human metastatic colon cancer [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we isolated human fetal intestinal cells from primary tissue and expanded the cells on the feeder layer. Other <italic>in vitro</italic> models have successfully been used to study and understand stem cell biology such as the three-dimensional system introduced by Sato, et al [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Importantly, we compared cells expanded from SI and LI isolated from the same donor tissue, minimizing potential discrepancies due to genetic variability. We also expanded the SI and LI cells in identical culture conditions, to allow for the comparison of intrinsically programmed differences. The stem cell enriched cultures from human SI and LI allowed us to compare stem cell and differentiation properties to determine key differences between these two cell populations, with possible implications to disease occurrence in these two regions of the intestine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>SI and LI epithelial cells expanded in vitro are enriched for cells expressing stem cell markers</title><p>To investigate the <italic>in vitro</italic> potential of cells isolated from the SI and LI, we used human intestinal tissues around gestational week 23. At this stage, crypts in both fetal SI and LI are structurally similar to those observed in adult, consisting of epithelial cells of all lineages, with the exception of a higher number of goblet cells in fetal tissue (<xref rid="pone.0118792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We used a feeder layer to expand cells from the SI and LI as it has previously been shown to expand human colon CSCs from metastatic colon cancer specimens [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, we found that growth of normal fetal intestinal cells on the feeder layer required the addition of R-spondin 2, a Wnt agonist acting via the LGR5 receptor [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This was not surprising considering that R-spondin 1 is known to be important for the <italic>in vitro</italic> expansion of intestinal cells and all four R-spondins bind the same receptor family and are expected to be somewhat redundant [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In total, 29 pairs of SI and LI were isolated and processed for culture on the feeder layer. After plating &#x0223c;80,000 primary cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, only 18 pairs formed rare colonies after approximately two weeks (62% success rate), indicating that only a small population of cells from primary tissue was capable of surviving selection under these culture conditions. Some samples were much more efficient at forming colonies than others, resulting in an estimated efficiency rate range of 0.00015&#x02013;0.005%. Serial passaging led to more robust expansion of intestinal cells. Phenotypic differences in colony density, cell size and shape were observed between cells expanded from SI and LI and could be passaged at least 10 times with no apparent morphological changes or oncogenic transformation (<xref rid="pone.0118792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0118792.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). After primary cell expansion <italic>in vitro</italic>, flow cytometric analyses revealed enrichment of epithelial cells, as marked by Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule (EPCAM), from 21.6 to 92.3% in cells expanded from SI and from 34.3% to 92.4% in cells expanded from LI (<xref rid="pone.0118792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C&#x00026;D</xref>). Over twenty cell-surface markers were interrogated for all SI and LI epithelial cell cultures. The most reproducible and relevant markers indicated that expanded intestinal cells expressed several markers associated with stemness. CD133.1 (AC133) has been suggested as a marker of CSCs in the intestine [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], as well as a marker for normal stem cells such as hematopoietic stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or neuronal stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. While primary cells from SI and LI contained less than 1% CD133.1<sup>+</sup> cells, approximately 70% of the expanded cells expressed CD133.1 (<xref rid="pone.0118792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Other putative stem cell markers showed similar expression profiles, including CD166 [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and CD24 [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], both enriched in expression over primary cells, similar to CD133.1 (<xref rid="pone.0118792.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and data not shown) [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A previous study using human tissue from three months to eighteen years of age reported isolation, characterization and expansion of stem cell populations from single cells [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Attempts were made to expand fetal primary intestinal cells after cell sorting, but no robust long-term colonies were generated from sorted primary cells. The developmental difference in pre-natal versus post-natal and adult tissues may account for our failure to generate long-term colonies from single cells. The environment is much more dynamic and mucinous in the prenatal developmental state even though adult-like structures are present. We therefore expanded bulk intestinal epithelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> directly from dissociated tissue prior to further characterization.</p><fig id="pone.0118792.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0118792.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title><italic>In vitro</italic> expanded primary epithelial cells from human fetal small and large intestine express stem cell markers.</title><p><bold>A-F</bold>, top panels: small intestine, bottom panels: large intestine (<bold>A</bold>) Hematoxylin and eosin paraffin sections of normal fetal intestine at 23 weeks of gestation.

LDA is a quantitative measurement that can determine the colony-forming frequency of a specific cell population. Increased colony-forming frequency correlates with stem cell activity [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Since CD66c showed a heterogeneous and opposite expression pattern in cells expanded from SI and LI, we asked whether it could distinguish colony-forming ability within these two populations of intestinal epithelial cells. Using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), we sorted expanded cells from three tissue-matched samples of SI and LI in limiting dilution based on high and low CD66c expression. Four weeks after plating, we calculated the colony-forming unit (CFU) frequency of the cells by linear regression [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The frequency of the EPCAM<sup>+</sup> colony-forming cells from SI and LI was similar, and ranged from 1/10 to 1/106. Interestingly, cells expanded from SI that expressed low levels of CD66c had a higher CFU frequency than CD66c<sup>hi</sup> cells, while LDA results for cells expanded from LI were reversed (<xref rid="pone.0118792.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, even though a majority of cells expanded from SI are CD66c<sup>hi</sup>, as seen in the staining index (<xref rid="pone.0118792.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), the subpopulation of CD66c<sup>low</sup> cells are the cells with more colony-forming ability (<xref rid="pone.0118792.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The opposite is true for cells derived from LI. In consequence, the disparity in expression of CD66c can be used to enrich for expanded SI and LI cells with self-renewal potential.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0118792.t001" orientation="portrait"

Here, we have removed any differences present in the SI and LI environments by providing identical growth factors and culture conditions for SI and LI cells. Therefore, the differences seen in cell lineage specification <italic>in vitro</italic> are due to differential intrinsic regulation of stem cells present in SI and LI.</p><p>We limited our investigation to human cells and by culturing bulk intestinal cells on a feeder layer with exogenous Wnt factor, R-Spondin 2, we were able to characterize expanded epithelial cells for stem cell properties such as self-renewal and mulitpotentiality without bias of pre-selecting the cells for a particular phenotype. <italic>In vivo</italic> balance of proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium, including the stem cell niche, depends on many Wnt factors [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Only recently was high expression of R-Spondin 2, known to enhance intestinal epithelial precursors and limit differentiation via LGR5, found in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, the R-Spondin 2 dependence of the intestinal epithelial cells expanded on feeder cells <italic>in vitro</italic> is consistent with the maintenance of intestinal stem cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The expected shared expression of putative stem cell markers CD133.1, CD166 and CD24 on cells expanded from the two intestinal segments suggested that they were of stem cell nature. However, differences emerged after analysis of the specific expression patterns of CD13, CD133.1 and CD66c. A higher expression of CD13 in cells expanded from SI is consistent with reports showing that it is the most abundant peptidase in mammalian SI, with CD13 expression continually decreasing along the ascending and descending LI [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, considering its relation to colon CSCs, the higher expression of CD133.1 on cells expanded from LI may indicate a predisposition of these cells to neoplastic transformation compared to cells expanded from SI [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Finally, by functionally exploiting the differential expression pattern of CD66c, we identified opposing populations of cells with colony-forming ability. High CD66c expression in stem cell enriched cultures from the LI confers increased self-renewal and, together with high expression of CD133.1, suggests an intrinsic regulatory difference for why these stem cells may be more susceptible to transformation than their SI counterparts [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, gene array analysis demonstrated global differences between cells expanded from the SI and LI. Differential expression indicated a tendency for cells expanded from the LI to be more closely related to cancer than their SI counterparts. Specifically, serologically defined colon cancer antigen 1 (<italic>SDCCAG1</italic>) and tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (<italic>TACSTD2</italic>) are defined by their presence and association with cancer. Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (<italic>HIF1A</italic>) functions in angiogenesis, ready to feed any new tumor that begins to form [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. <italic>Prom1</italic>, also known as <italic>CD133</italic>, is a well-known CSC marker discussed previously [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The higher expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (<italic>IGFBP3</italic>), involved in intestinal epithelium homeostasis, may indicate a more delicate balance necessary in the LI compared to the SI [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Lastly, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (<italic>SPP1</italic>), also known as osteopontin (<italic>OPN</italic>), was the transcript with the highest fold change between LI and SI cells (142-fold higher in LI cells). Not only is SPP1 expression higher in colorectal cancer cell lines than normal intestinal cell lines, but it is higher in tumor tissue in comparison to normal tissue [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It also correlates with lymph node metastasis, lymphatic or venous invasion and TNM stage (classification of malignant tumors). Patients with a higher expression of SPP1 had lower 5-year survival rates and it is thought to be an independent prognostic factor. Therefore, it may play a role in CRC progression and could be a prognostic marker for patients [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The increased expression of these molecules in LI cells and their associated molecular pathways not only confirm the intrinsic differences between the SI and LI, but possibly a functional reason for why there is more cancer in the LI compared to the SI. Therefore, differences at the stem cell level not only contribute to the separate structure and function of the two tissue segments, but also to their differing response to insults leading to disease.</p><p>The molecular differences identified between cells expanded from the SI and LI correlated well with the disparities in differentiation using a three-dimensional culture system. Fordham et. al used similar culture conditions for the growth of intestinal stem cells from fetal material at the gestational age of ten weeks [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, cells from such an early stage did not require expansion prior to high efficiency formation of organoids from primary tissue, but did require additional factors to sustain cells. At 20&#x02013;23 weeks, as presented here, the primary tissue structure is much more differentiated, mimicking adult organization and requiring selection and expansion on feeder cells prior to use in organoid formation assays. In addition, in the Fordham et. al study, whole epithelial units were initially embedded in their cultures, whereas in our study, single cells were plated on a feeder layer in order to eliminate the more differentiated cells present at 20&#x02013;23 weeks gestational age. The feeder layer allowed us to expand and maintain the stem cell population in an undifferentiated state prior to embedding in Matrigel. This expansion allowed for a more homogenous cell population for analysis in the organoid system, without the presence of differentiated cells from primary tissue.</p><p>The initial observation of differentiation into goblet cells confirmed the multipotentiality of cells expanded from both SI and LI while demonstrating that their intrinsic differences determine unique differentiation potential. The undetectable expression of <italic>ATOH1</italic> in LI organoids was in agreement with the gene expression profiling data, which showed that cells expanded from LI express <italic>ATOH1</italic> at a lower level than cells expanded from SI. Interestingly, <italic>ATOH1</italic> is required for the efficacy of GSIs [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], which may explain the limited MUC2 protein expression seen in DAPT treated LI organoids. Previous studies showed that 70% of colorectal cancer patient samples have significantly decreased expression of ATOH1 compared to tissue-matched normal LI samples, and revealed ATOH1 as a tumor suppressor <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, the lack of detectable <italic>ATOH1</italic> in cells expanded from the LI could make them more susceptible to transformation than their SI counterparts.</p><p>Lastly, the disparity in expression of stem cell related genes <italic>EPHB2</italic>, <italic>LGR5</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic> might indicate a yet unknown molecular pathway that distinguishes LI stem cells from SI stem cells. The higher expression of <italic>LGR5</italic> in LI organoids could mean the presence of cells with higher resistance to damage, DNA repair and growth advantage that, if transformed, could confer resistance to cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Even though <italic>LGR5</italic> expression remains high with differentiation treatment in LI cultures, LGR5 likely remains a stem cell marker in both the SI and LI. <italic>Lgr5</italic><sup>+</sup> cells are present in cycling columnar cells of the mouse at the crypt base and can generate cells of all the epithelial lineages of the intestine, suggesting stem cell nature [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, as a receptor for R-Spondin 2, LGR5 can mediate the stem cell niche [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the work presented here presents a novel observation in human cells of differential regulation of <italic>LGR5</italic> upon differentiation that may indicate a separate function of LGR5 in the LI in addition to its presence as an intestinal stem cell marker.</p><p>Functionally, LGR5 is both a receptor for Wnt ligands (R-spondins) and a transcriptional target of the Wnt pathway [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

This seems to be discordant with a parallel increase in goblet cells under the same conditions in LI cells after differentiation treatment (<xref rid="pone.0118792.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-C</xref>). Wnt and Notch signaling pathways are known to function cooperatively in intestinal epithelium, intestinal stem cells and tumor development [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ATOH1, a key regulator of the Notch pathway, can be marked for degradation by GSK3-&#x003b2; in the presence of Wnt signals and is thought to be necessary for goblet cell formation and response to &#x003b3;-secretase inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].

The combined result of high <italic>LGR5</italic> coupled with the absence of <italic>ATOH1</italic> in the LI, may indicate a possible new pathway potentially involving LGR5/Wnt and ATOH1/Notch for the regulation of differentiation in the LI.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report characterizing the differences between cells expanded from primary human SI and LI. The expected results observed from experiments in SI samples confirm that combining the expansion of an enriched stem cell population with subsequent three-dimensional differentiation assays reproducibly creates an environment similar to that found <italic>in vivo</italic>. While there is evidence of extrinsic regulation of intestinal stem cells [<xref rid="pone.0118792.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] the unexpected results seen with the LI samples suggest key intrinsic differences between human SI and LI stem cells. These differences may account for the increased prevalence of LI cancer compared to SI cancer, as well as highlight crucial protective mechanisms present in the SI that could be harnessed to improve prevention and treatment of human LI cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Mouse experiments were performed under the guidelines of the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which approved the study, and were performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the care and use of animals (approval no. 1006567).
