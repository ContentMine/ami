      <p>The intestine is composed of an epithelial layer containing rapidly proliferating
         cells that mature into two regions, the small and the large intestine. Although previous
         studies have identified stem cells as the cell-of-origin for intestinal epithelial
         cells, no studies have directly compared stem cells derived from these anatomically
         distinct regions. Here, we examine intrinsic differences between primary epithelial
         cells isolated from human fetal small and large intestine, after 
         <i>in vitro</i> expansion, using the Wnt agonist R-spondin 2. We utilized flow cytometry, fluorescence-activated
         cell sorting, gene expression analysis and a three-dimensional 
         <i>in vitro</i> differentiation assay to characterize their stem cell properties. We identified stem
         cell markers that separate subpopulations of colony-forming cells in the small and
         large intestine and revealed important differences in differentiation, proliferation
         and disease pathways using gene expression analysis. Single cells from small and large
         intestine cultures formed organoids that reflect the distinct cellular hierarchy found
         
         <i>in vivo</i> and respond differently to identical exogenous cues. Our characterization identified
         numerous differences between small and large intestine epithelial stem cells suggesting
         possible connections to intestinal disease.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The intestine consists of two major subdivisions: the small intestine (SI) and the
         large intestine (LI), which differ in structure and function. The SI is largely responsible
         for the digestion and absorption of food while the LI aids in final water absorption
         and waste removal. Among other signaling pathways, Wnt and Notch control the well-defined
         epithelial hierarchy in the intestine, helping to maintain stem cell homeostasis.
         Since these pathways require receptors, ligands and transcriptional regulation, it
         is unclear whether differences observed between the SI and LI are primarily due to
         intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref001">1</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref002">2</span>]. Understanding these differences is crucial, since failure of intestinal stem cells
         to properly proliferate and differentiate may lead to cancer, which is 20 times more
         prevalent in the LI than the SI in humans [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref003">3</span>]. However, a thorough investigation of the origin of the differences between the
         SI and LI has yet to be done.
      </p>
      <p>The identification and characterization of stem cells in the intestine has evolved
         rather rapidly in recent years. 
         <i>In vivo</i> lineage tracing studies have identified leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein
         coupled receptor 5 (LGR5)
         <sup>+</sup> stem cells in the mouse as cells capable of generating all the epithelial cells of
         the intestine and forming crypt-like structures 
         <i>in vitro</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref004">4</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref005">5</span>]. Interestingly, LGR5 is intricately involved in the synergistic activation of the
         Wnt pathway, via the R-Spondin protein family, which is responsible for homeostatic
         crypt formation and maintenance in the intestine [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref006">6</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref008">8</span>]. This pathway is also commonly altered in colon cancer via mutation of adenomatous
         polyposis coli (APC), causing an accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus and enhanced
         Wnt signaling [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref009">9</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref010">10</span>]. Rapidly growing adenomas form in the mouse after deletion of APC in LGR5
         <sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells, suggesting that normal stem cells are the cell-of-origin of
         intestinal cancer [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref011">11</span>]. Additionally, murine adenomas revealed continual LGR5
         <sup>+</sup> stem cell activity, providing functional evidence of a cancerous stem cell population
         in primary intestinal adenomas [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref012">12</span>].
      </p>
      <p>The Wnt pathway has extensive cross-talk with the Notch pathway in its control over
         cell fate decisions, proliferation and tumorigenesis [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref001">1</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref013">13</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref014">14</span>]. More specifically, activation of the Notch pathway represses secretory cell differentiation
         but inhibition of the Notch pathway leads to activation of atonal homolog 1 (ATOH1)
         promoting goblet cell differentiation (
         <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0118792.s001">S1 Fig.</span>) [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref001">1</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref015">15</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref016">16</span>]. Thus far, a majority of studies elucidating these pathways in the intestine have
         not made clear distinctions between the SI and LI, possibly missing differences with
         important consequences.
      </p>
      <p>The majority of intestinal stem cell characterization has been performed in animal
         models because cells from normal human intestine has been notoriously difficult to
         grow 
         <i>in vitro</i> and lineage tracing cannot be performed practically in humans. To overcome these
         limitations, we used feeder cells as a stromal layer to provide cell-cell interactions
         with human intestinal cells and promote epithelial cell growth [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref017">17</span>]. Our lab has previously used this system to isolate and expand tumor cells with
         stem cell properties (cancer stem cells, CSCs) from human metastatic colon cancer
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref018">18</span>]. Here, we isolated human fetal intestinal cells from primary tissue and expanded
         the cells on the feeder layer. Other 
         <i>in vitro</i> models have successfully been used to study and understand stem cell biology such
         as the three-dimensional system introduced by Sato, et al [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref005">5</span>]. Importantly, we compared cells expanded from SI and LI isolated from the same donor
         tissue, minimizing potential discrepancies due to genetic variability. We also expanded
         the SI and LI cells in identical culture conditions, to allow for the comparison of
         intrinsically programmed differences. The stem cell enriched cultures from human SI
         and LI allowed us to compare stem cell and differentiation properties to determine
         key differences between these two cell populations, with possible implications to
         disease occurrence in these two regions of the intestine.

         <h3>SI and LI epithelial cells expanded in vitro are enriched for cells expressing stem
            cell markers
         </h3>
         <p>To investigate the 
            <i>in vitro</i> potential of cells isolated from the SI and LI, we used human intestinal tissues
            around gestational week 23. At this stage, crypts in both fetal SI and LI are structurally
            similar to those observed in adult, consisting of epithelial cells of all lineages,
            with the exception of a higher number of goblet cells in fetal tissue (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g001">Fig. 1A</span>). We used a feeder layer to expand cells from the SI and LI as it has previously
            been shown to expand human colon CSCs from metastatic colon cancer specimens [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref018">18</span>]. In addition, we found that growth of normal fetal intestinal cells on the feeder
            layer required the addition of R-spondin 2, a Wnt agonist acting via the LGR5 receptor
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref008">8</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref019">19</span>]. This was not surprising considering that R-spondin 1 is known to be important for
            the 
            <i>in vitro</i> expansion of intestinal cells and all four R-spondins bind the same receptor family
            and are expected to be somewhat redundant [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref005">5</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref008">8</span>]. In total, 29 pairs of SI and LI were isolated and processed for culture on the
            feeder layer. After plating ∼80,000 primary cells/cm
            <sup>2</sup>, only 18 pairs formed rare colonies after approximately two weeks (62% success rate),
            indicating that only a small population of cells from primary tissue was capable of
            surviving selection under these culture conditions. Some samples were much more efficient
            at forming colonies than others, resulting in an estimated efficiency rate range of
            0.00015–0.005%. Serial passaging led to more robust expansion of intestinal cells.
            Phenotypic differences in colony density, cell size and shape were observed between
            cells expanded from SI and LI and could be passaged at least 10 times with no apparent
            morphological changes or oncogenic transformation (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g001">Fig. 1B</span> and 
            <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0118792.s006">S1 Table</span>). After primary cell expansion 
            <i>in vitro</i>, flow cytometric analyses revealed enrichment of epithelial cells, as marked by Epithelial
            Cell Adhesion Molecule (EPCAM), from 21.6 to 92.3% in cells expanded from SI and from
            34.3% to 92.4% in cells expanded from LI (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g001">Fig. 1C&amp;D</span>). Over twenty cell-surface markers were interrogated for all SI and LI epithelial
            cell cultures. The most reproducible and relevant markers indicated that expanded
            intestinal cells expressed several markers associated with stemness. CD133.1 (AC133)
            has been suggested as a marker of CSCs in the intestine [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref020">20</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref022">22</span>], as well as a marker for normal stem cells such as hematopoietic stem cells [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref023">23</span>] or neuronal stem cells [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref024">24</span>]. While primary cells from SI and LI contained less than 1% CD133.1
            <sup>+</sup> cells, approximately 70% of the expanded cells expressed CD133.1 (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g001">Fig. 1E</span>). Other putative stem cell markers showed similar expression profiles, including
            CD166 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref025">25</span>] and CD24 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref026">26</span>], both enriched in expression over primary cells, similar to CD133.1 (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g001">Fig. 1F</span> and data not shown) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref018">18</span>]. A previous study using human tissue from three months to eighteen years of age
            reported isolation, characterization and expansion of stem cell populations from single
            cells [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref027">27</span>]. Attempts were made to expand fetal primary intestinal cells after cell sorting,
            but no robust long-term colonies were generated from sorted primary cells. The developmental
            difference in pre-natal versus post-natal and adult tissues may account for our failure
            to generate long-term colonies from single cells. The environment is much more dynamic
            and mucinous in the prenatal developmental state even though adult-like structures
            are present. We therefore expanded bulk intestinal epithelial cells 
            <i>in vitro</i> directly from dissociated tissue prior to further characterization.

         <p>To demonstrate the functional importance of the differential expression of cell surface
            markers, we used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to assess the clonogenic potential
            of epithelial cell populations derived from SI and LI. LDA is a quantitative measurement
            that can determine the colony-forming frequency of a specific cell population. Increased
            colony-forming frequency correlates with stem cell activity [

            these two populations of intestinal epithelial cells. Using Fluorescence-Activated
            Cell Sorting (FACS), we sorted expanded cells from three tissue-matched samples of
            SI and LI in limiting dilution based on high and low CD66c expression. Four weeks
            after plating, we calculated the colony-forming unit (CFU) frequency of the cells
            by linear regression [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref030">30</span>]. The frequency of the EPCAM
            <sup>+</sup> colony-forming cells from SI and LI was similar, and ranged from 1/10 to 1/106. Interestingly,
            cells expanded from SI that expressed low levels of CD66c had a higher CFU frequency
            than CD66c
            <sup>hi</sup> cells, while LDA results for cells expanded from LI were reversed (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="pone.0118792.t001">Table 1</span>). Therefore, even though a majority of cells expanded from SI are CD66c
            <sup>hi</sup>, as seen in the staining index (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g002">Fig. 2B</span>), the subpopulation of CD66c
            <sup>low</sup> cells are the cells with more colony-forming ability (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="pone.0118792.t001">Table 1</span>). The opposite is true for cells derived from LI. In consequence, the disparity in
            expression of CD66c can be used to enrich for expanded SI and LI cells with self-renewal
            potential.

         <p>We showed that expanded epithelial cells from SI and LI are enriched for intestinal
            stem cells as evidenced by their dependence on R-Spondin 2, their expression of stem
            cell markers (

            demonstrated differences in their molecular signatures (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus:
            GSE56525). Among the 21,238 total probes on each array, 3274 probes were significantly
            different. After removal of probes for the same gene, 1118 transcripts had an expression
            fold change greater than 1.5. Cells expanded from SI and LI clustered separately using
            unsupervised hierarchical clustering methods where the distances are defined linearly
            (left axis, 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g003">Fig. 3A</span>). Therefore, even though we were unable to distinguish subregions in SI tissue (ileum,
            jejunum, etc.), we did not detect any major differences or heterogeneity among the
            many SI samples examined. In addition, while our samples ranged in age from 20–23
            weeks, this variable was deemed non-essential due to proper clustering of gene expression
            among the SI and LI samples.

         <p>Using immunofluorescent staining for differentiation markers, we analyzed SI and LI
            organoids for the presence of mature intestinal cells. The expression of Mucin 2 (MUC2),
            a marker of mature goblet cells, significantly increased upon treatment with differentiation
            media without and with DAPT (Diff and Diff+DAPT) in both SI and LI organoids (

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>In this study, we used paired sets of human fetal SI and LI to investigate the differences
         between the two distinct anatomic regions with potentially different stem cell populations.
         While others have successfully cultured organoids from mouse and/or human tissue from
         varying ages [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref005">5</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref019">19</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref027">27</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref032">32</span>], excluding 20–23 week human fetal tissue as used here, none directly compared the
         intrinsic differences of the SI and LI. 
         <i>In vivo</i>, a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors determine the structural and cellular
         components of the SI and LI [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref033">33</span>]. Here, we have removed any differences present in the SI and LI environments by
         providing identical growth factors and culture conditions for SI and LI cells. Therefore,
         the differences seen in cell lineage specification 
         <i>in vitro</i> are due to differential intrinsic regulation of stem cells present in SI and LI.
      </p>
      <p>We limited our investigation to human cells and by culturing bulk intestinal cells
         on a feeder layer with exogenous Wnt factor, R-Spondin 2, we were able to characterize
         expanded epithelial cells for stem cell properties such as self-renewal and mulitpotentiality
         without bias of pre-selecting the cells for a particular phenotype. 
         <i>In vivo</i> balance of proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal epithelium, including
         the stem cell niche, depends on many Wnt factors [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref004">4</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref005">5</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref034">34</span>]. Only recently was high expression of R-Spondin 2, known to enhance intestinal epithelial
         precursors and limit differentiation via LGR5, found in intestinal subepithelial myofibroblasts
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref035">35</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref036">36</span>]. Therefore, the R-Spondin 2 dependence of the intestinal epithelial cells expanded
         on feeder cells 
         <i>in vitro</i> is consistent with the maintenance of intestinal stem cells 
         <i>in vivo</i>.
      </p>
      <p>The expected shared expression of putative stem cell markers CD133.1, CD166 and CD24
         on cells expanded from the two intestinal segments suggested that they were of stem
         cell nature. However, differences emerged after analysis of the specific expression
         patterns of CD13, CD133.1 and CD66c. A higher expression of CD13 in cells expanded
         from SI is consistent with reports showing that it is the most abundant peptidase
         in mammalian SI, with CD13 expression continually decreasing along the ascending and
         descending LI [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref037">37</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref038">38</span>]. Furthermore, considering its relation to colon CSCs, the higher expression of CD133.1
         on cells expanded from LI may indicate a predisposition of these cells to neoplastic
         transformation compared to cells expanded from SI [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref039">39</span>]. Finally, by functionally exploiting the differential expression pattern of CD66c,
         we identified opposing populations of cells with colony-forming ability. High CD66c
         expression in stem cell enriched cultures from the LI confers increased self-renewal
         and, together with high expression of CD133.1, suggests an intrinsic regulatory difference
         for why these stem cells may be more susceptible to transformation than their SI counterparts
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref040">40</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref041">41</span>].
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, gene array analysis demonstrated global differences between cells expanded
         from the SI and LI. Differential expression indicated a tendency for cells expanded
         from the LI to be more closely related to cancer than their SI counterparts. Specifically,
         serologically defined colon cancer antigen 1 (
         <i>SDCCAG1</i>) and tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (
         <i>TACSTD2</i>) are defined by their presence and association with cancer. Hypoxia inducible factor
         1 (
         <i>HIF1A</i>) functions in angiogenesis, ready to feed any new tumor that begins to form [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref042">42</span>]. 
         <i>Prom1</i>, also known as 
         <i>CD133</i>, is a well-known CSC marker discussed previously [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref020">20</span>]. The higher expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (
         <i>IGFBP3</i>), involved in intestinal epithelium homeostasis, may indicate a more delicate balance
         necessary in the LI compared to the SI [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref043">43</span>]. Lastly, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (
         <i>SPP1</i>), also known as osteopontin (
         <i>OPN</i>), was the transcript with the highest fold change between LI and SI cells (142-fold
         higher in LI cells). Not only is SPP1 expression higher in colorectal cancer cell
         lines than normal intestinal cell lines, but it is higher in tumor tissue in comparison
         to normal tissue [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref044">44</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref045">45</span>]. It also correlates with lymph node metastasis, lymphatic or venous invasion and
         TNM stage (classification of malignant tumors). Patients with a higher expression
         of SPP1 had lower 5-year survival rates and it is thought to be an independent prognostic
         factor. Therefore, it may play a role in CRC progression and could be a prognostic
         marker for patients [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref045">45</span>]. The increased expression of these molecules in LI cells and their associated molecular
         pathways not only confirm the intrinsic differences between the SI and LI, but possibly
         a functional reason for why there is more cancer in the LI compared to the SI. Therefore,
         differences at the stem cell level not only contribute to the separate structure and
         function of the two tissue segments, but also to their differing response to insults
         leading to disease.
      </p>
      <p>The molecular differences identified between cells expanded from the SI and LI correlated
         well with the disparities in differentiation using a three-dimensional culture system.
         Fordham et. al used similar culture conditions for the growth of intestinal stem cells
         from fetal material at the gestational age of ten weeks [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref046">46</span>]. However, cells from such an early stage did not require expansion prior to high
         efficiency formation of organoids from primary tissue, but did require additional
         factors to sustain cells. At 20–23 weeks, as presented here, the primary tissue structure
         is much more differentiated, mimicking adult organization and requiring selection
         and expansion on feeder cells prior to use in organoid formation assays. In addition,
         in the Fordham et. al study, whole epithelial units were initially embedded in their
         cultures, whereas in our study, single cells were plated on a feeder layer in order
         to eliminate the more differentiated cells present at 20–23 weeks gestational age.
         The feeder layer allowed us to expand and maintain the stem cell population in an
         undifferentiated state prior to embedding in Matrigel. This expansion allowed for
         a more homogenous cell population for analysis in the organoid system, without the
         presence of differentiated cells from primary tissue.
      </p>
      <p>The initial observation of differentiation into goblet cells confirmed the multipotentiality
         of cells expanded from both SI and LI while demonstrating that their intrinsic differences
         determine unique differentiation potential. The undetectable expression of 
         <i>ATOH1</i> in LI organoids was in agreement with the gene expression profiling data, which showed
         that cells expanded from LI express 
         <i>ATOH1</i> at a lower level than cells expanded from SI. Interestingly, 
         <i>ATOH1</i> is required for the efficacy of GSIs [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref047">47</span>], which may explain the limited MUC2 protein expression seen in DAPT treated LI organoids.
         Previous studies showed that 70% of colorectal cancer patient samples have significantly
         decreased expression of ATOH1 compared to tissue-matched normal LI samples, and revealed
         ATOH1 as a tumor suppressor 
         <i>in vitro</i> and 
         <i>in vivo</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref048">48</span>]. Therefore, the lack of detectable 
         <i>ATOH1</i> in cells expanded from the LI could make them more susceptible to transformation
         than their SI counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>Lastly, the disparity in expression of stem cell related genes 
         <i>EPHB2</i>, 
         <i>LGR5</i> and 
         <i>MYC</i> might indicate a yet unknown molecular pathway that distinguishes LI stem cells from
         SI stem cells. The higher expression of 
         <i>LGR5</i> in LI organoids could mean the presence of cells with higher resistance to damage,
         DNA repair and growth advantage that, if transformed, could confer resistance to cancer

         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref050">50</span>]. Even though 
         <i>LGR5</i> expression remains high with differentiation treatment in LI cultures, LGR5 likely
         remains a stem cell marker in both the SI and LI. 
         <i>Lgr5</i>
         <sup>+</sup> cells are present in cycling columnar cells of the mouse at the crypt base and can
         generate cells of all the epithelial lineages of the intestine, suggesting stem cell
         nature [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref004">4</span>]. In addition, as a receptor for R-Spondin 2, LGR5 can mediate the stem cell niche
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref006">6</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref008">8</span>]. However, the work presented here presents a novel observation in human cells of
         differential regulation of 
         <i>LGR5</i> upon differentiation that may indicate a separate function of LGR5 in the LI in addition
         to its presence as an intestinal stem cell marker.
      </p>
      <p>Functionally, LGR5 is both a receptor for Wnt ligands (R-spondins) and a transcriptional
         target of the Wnt pathway [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref004">4</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref006">6</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref008">8</span>]. Here, we show that 
         <i>LGR5</i> mRNA is expressed differently between SI and LI cells, with 
         <i>LGR5</i> remaining high in LI cells after the removal of Wnt factors and even under γ-secretase
         inhibition (
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g006">Fig. 6D&amp;E</span>). This seems to be discordant with a parallel increase in goblet cells under the
         same conditions in LI cells after differentiation treatment (
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g005">Fig. 5A-C</span>). Wnt and Notch signaling pathways are known to function cooperatively in intestinal
         epithelium, intestinal stem cells and tumor development [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref001">1</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref013">13</span>,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref014">14</span>]. ATOH1, a key regulator of the Notch pathway, can be marked for degradation by GSK3-β
         in the presence of Wnt signals and is thought to be necessary for goblet cell formation
         and response to γ-secretase inhibition [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref047">47</span>]. Here, we show that 
         <i>ATOH1</i> was not detected in cells derived from LI, even under γ-secretase inhibition (
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0118792.g006">Fig. 6B&amp;E</span>), suggesting an alternative pathway in the LI. The combined result of high 
         <i>LGR5</i> coupled with the absence of 
         <i>ATOH1</i> in the LI, may indicate a possible new pathway potentially involving LGR5/Wnt and
         ATOH1/Notch for the regulation of differentiation in the LI.
      </p>
      <p>To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report characterizing the differences
         between cells expanded from primary human SI and LI. The expected results observed
         from experiments in SI samples confirm that combining the expansion of an enriched
         stem cell population with subsequent three-dimensional differentiation assays reproducibly
         creates an environment similar to that found 
         <i>in vivo</i>. While there is evidence of extrinsic regulation of intestinal stem cells [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0118792.ref033">33</span>] the unexpected results seen with the LI samples suggest key intrinsic differences
         between human SI and LI stem cells. These differences may account for the increased
         prevalence of LI cancer compared to SI cancer, as well as highlight crucial protective
         mechanisms present in the SI that could be harnessed to improve prevention and treatment
         of human LI cancer.

            at low density (∼50,000 cells/well of 48-well plate). After solidification at 37°C
            for 30 min, the Matrigel was overlaid with Stem Cell media (SC) (
            <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0118792.s009">S4 Table</span>). For the first 24 hours, the media included Y-27632 to prevent anoikis. After initial
            plating in SC media and the formation of small organoids, two-thirds of the wells
            were switched to Differentiation (Diff) media to allow differentiation of the organoids
            to occur. After further growth of the organoids, DAPT (Reagents Direct, CA), a γ-secretase
            inhibitor, was added to half the wells containing Diff media at 10μmol/mL for three
            days. Media was changed on all wells three times a week. Resulting organoids were
            isolated using 0.2% dispase (Life Technologies, NY), 0.1% collagenase II and 20μg/mL
            DNase I. Organoids were then rinsed in PBS (Mediatech, VA) for downstream applications.

               MUC2 and the cell adopts a goblet cell fate.

            <p>Selected genes were assayed using real-time PCR as confirmation of gene array results.
               RNA from cells expanded from three paired SI and LI samples (1, 2 and 3) were assayed
               for expression of six genes identified as differentially expressed in the gene array
               analysis. In 6/6 cases, the real-time PCR analysis confirmed the same expression pattern
               as the gene array analysis. SI values used as control and set to 1 in each case. LI
               expression values are relative to SI expression. SI 1 and 3 had no detectable expression
               of 
               <i>SPP1</i>, therefore, SI2 was used to calculate fold change in LI 1, 2 and 3. Expression was
               normalized to 
               <i>GAPDH</i> mRNA. Fold changes are presented above bars for clarification. Error bars represent
               upper and lower error limits based on replicate variability. All expression comparisons
