         <h2>Background</h2>
         <p>At our institute, a chemoradioselection strategy has been used to select patients
            for organ preservation on the basis of response to an initial 30–40 Gy concurrent
            chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Patients with a favorable response (i.e., chemoradioselected;
            CRS) have demonstrated better outcomes than those with an unfavorable response (i.e.,
            nonchemoradioselected; N-CRS). Successful targeting of molecules that attenuate the
            efficacy of chmoradioselection may improve results. Thus, the aim of this study was
            to evaluate the association of a novel cancer stem cell (CSC) marker, CD44 variant
            9 (CD44v9), with cellular refractoriness to chemoradioselection in advanced head and
            neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sec002">
         <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
         <p>Through a medical chart search, 102 patients with advanced HNSCC treated with chemoradioselection
            from 1997 to 2008 were enrolled. According to our algorithm, 30 patients were CRC
            following induction CCRT and 72 patients were N-CRS. Using the conventional immunohistochemical
            technique, biopsy specimens and surgically removed tumor specimens were immunostained
            with the anti-CD44v9 specific antibodies.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sec003">
         <h2>Results</h2>
         <p>The intrinsic expression levels of CD44v9 in the biopsy specimens did not correlate
            with the chemoradioselection and patient survival. However, in N-CRS patients, the
            CD44v9-positive group demonstrated significantly (
            <i>P</i> = 0.008) worse prognosis, than the CD44v9-negative group. Multivariate analyses demonstrated
            that among 
            <u>four</u> candidate factors (T, N, response to CCRT, and CD44v9), CD44v9 positivity (HR: 3.145,
            95% CI: 1.235–8.008, 
            <i>P</i> = 0.0163) was significantly correlated with the poor prognosis, along with advanced
            N stage (HR: 3.525, 95% CI: 1.054–9.060, 
            <i>P</i> = 0.0228). Furthermore, the survival rate of the CD44v9-induced group was significantly
            (
            <i>P</i> = 0.04) worse than the CD44v9-non-induced group.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sec004">
         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
         <p>CCRT-induced CD44v9-expressing CSCs appear to be a major hurdle to chemoradioselection.
            CD44v9-targeting seems to be a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of chemoradioselection
            and consequent organ preservation and survival.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Despite recent advances in multidisciplinary treatments, the overall survival and
         quality of life of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
         have not improved considerably over the past decade [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref001">1</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref002">2</span>]. Thus, establishment of clinically effective therapies based on HNSCC biology is
         imperative. In the Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery at Kyushu
         University and its affiliated institutes, a strategy called chemoradioselection has
         been used as a tool to measure the biological aggressiveness of an individual tumor
         since 1972 [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref003">3</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref005">5</span>]. In brief, responses of tumors are evaluated following 30–40 Gy of concurrent chemoradiothepapy
         (CCRT). Then, patients who demonstrate favorable responses (i.e., chemoradioselected;
         CRS), proceed to further CCRT up to 60–70Gy, whereas those with unfavorable responses
         (i.e., non-chemoradioselected; N-CRS), undergo radical surgery, which often results
         in the loss of vital organs (e.g., the larynx). Intriguingly, CRS patients demonstrate
         significantly better survival and organ preservation irrespective of their clinical
         stages, suggesting the accuracy of chemoradioselection [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref003">3</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref005">5</span>]. Recently, a similar concept of chemoselection was postulated by a group at the
         University of Michigan, facilitating improved organ preservation and survival [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref006">6</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref008">8</span>]. Thus, if the efficacy of chemo-/radioselection is enhanced, more improved survival
         and organ preservation in patients, particularly, those with advanced HNSCC might
         be feasible [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref001">1</span>]. Based on this speculation the aim of this study is to elucidate mechanisms, which
         attenuate the effects of chemoradioselection to develop clinical effective targeted
         therapies.
      </p>
      <p>During the last decade, it has become apparent that cancer stem cells (CSCs), which
         are characterized by strong potential for self-renewal and propagation of heterogeneous
         tumor, may be the main cause of tumor refractoriness to conventional chemo-/radio
         therapies [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref009">9</span>]. Survival of a single CSC can cause tumor re-growth and more importantly CSCs have
         been proposed to be a source of distant metastases [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref009">9</span>]. In HNSCC, the standard form of CD44 (CD44s) was first identified as a surface marker
         of CSCs by Prince et al., and it is expressed in &lt; 10% of HNSCC cells [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref010">10</span>]. However, the results of an immunohistochemical study, which demonstrated that 60%-95%
         of cells in the normal epithelium of head and neck and 60%-100% of HNSCC cells expressed
         CD44s, have cast a doubt on the credibility of this marker [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref011">11</span>]. In addition, inoculation of a small number of CD44s-negative HNSCC cells caused
         development of a bulk tumor in immune-compromised mouse [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref012">12</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref013">13</span>]. In contrast, through a series of 
         <i>in vitro</i> and 
         <i>in vivo</i> assays and experiments with clinical samples, mainly performed in the laboratory
         of Prof. Saya at Keio University, CD44 variant 9 (CD44v9), a splicing variant of CD44,
         has emerged as a novel marker of cancer stemness in a variety of solid tumors including
         HNSCC [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref014">14</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref018">18</span>]. Functionally, CD44v9 increases the intra-cellular levels of reduced glutathione
         (GSH) when coupled with xCT, thereby protecting cells from ROS and oxidative stress,
         which is one of the distinct properties of CSCs [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref014">14</span>]. This scenario well explains the mechanism by which CSCs can survive chemo-/radio
         therapies, because these agents have been reported to exert cytotoxic effects mainly
         through ROS production of [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref014">14</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref019">19</span>]. Indeed, in HNSCC tumor samples, double immunostainings with involucrin, a differentiation
         marker, and CD44v9 clearly demonstrated a mutually exclusive staining pattern and
         induction chemotherapy preferentially killed involucrin-positive cancer cells, resulting
         in the marked induction of CD44v9-positive cells. The expression levels of CD44v9
         in HNSCC cell lines were associated with the increased levels of intracellular GHS
         and resistance to cisplatin. Thus, treatments of CD44v9-expressing HNSCC cell lines
         with an inhibitor of xCT, sulfasalazine, significantly inhibited cellular viability
         and tumor growth in nude mice and enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref016">16</span>].
      </p>
      <p>In view of these findings, we immunohistochemically examined the expression levels
         of CD44v9 protein in clinical samples obtained from patients with advanced HNSCC treated
         according to the platinum-based chemoradioselection strategy to determine if CD44v9-expressing
         HNSCC cells possess stemness and cause cellular refractoriness to chemoradioselection.

         <h3>Patient characteristics, sub-grouping and tissue samples</h3>
         <p>Through a medical chart search for patients who were treated at our institute from
            1997 to 2008, we selected 102 patients to this study who met the following criteria:
            (1) those with previously untreated hypopharyngeal, laryngeal or oral cavity cancer
            patients with stage III or IV tumor according to the UICC TNM classification (2002);
            (2) those treated with the chemoradioselection strategy; (3) those with no distant
            metastasis; and (4) those with biopsy and/or surgically removed specimens that apparently
            contained invasive fronts of tumor that were adjacent or surrounded by tumor-associated
            stroma in our formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue archive; this last criteria
            was included because scoring of immunostaining was performed in these tumor fronts
            as described below. The virus-related HNSCCs (i.e., nasopharynx and oropharynx) were
            excluded from the analyses to focus on the biological role of CD44v9. This study was
            approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Kyushu Cancer Center (No
            2013-107). Written informed consent was given by participants for their clinical records
            to be used in this study.

            months (range: 2 to 151). Their average age was 60.8 years. There were 27 patients

         <p>Anti-human CD44v9 rat IgG monoclonal antibody (RV3), which specifically recognizes
            human CD44v9, was generated and kindly provided by Prof. Saya, Keio University. This
            antibody has been used in previous studies [

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref018">18</span>]. Immunostaining for CD44v9 was performed as described previously [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref015">15</span>]. In brief, a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Standard Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
            CA, USA) with a heated-induced, antigen-retrieval step was used to perform immunohistochemical
            staining for CD44v9. Xylene was used to deparaffinize the sections, which were rehydrated
            in a series of ethanols. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed in Target Retrieval
            Solution (S-1699, DAKO, Tokyo, Japan) in an autoclave at 121°C for 15 min. After cooling
            at room temperature for 20 min, the slides were thoroughly washed in Tris-buffered
            saline (TBS), pH 7.6. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked at room temperature
            by treatment with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min. The sections were
            washed in TBS and then transferred to a Shandon Sequenza staining system in a humidified
            chamber (Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., Yokohama, Japan). Non-specific antibody binding
            was inhibited by incubating the sections in 10% normal rabbit serum. The slides were
            incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against CD44v9 (RV3) (diluted 1:12500; 0.2μg/ml)
            at 4°C overnight. These sections were washed thrice with TBS and incubated for 30
            minutes in biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG (Dako, Tokyo, Japan) diluted 1:200 in
            Antibody Diluent. The Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used
            to visualize CD44v9 expression. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Appropriate
            negative and positive controls were used in each staining run. There were 2 types
            of negative controls: 1) non-immune rat IgG2a-Negative Isotype control (Millipore,
            Billerica, MA, USA) with the same concentration as the primary antibody and 2) dilution
            buffer without the primary antibody. Breast cancer tissue was used as the positive
            control,

            that were adjacent or surrounded by tumor-associated stroma to exclusively count cancer
            cells. This approach was also based on the speculation that CSCs, including those
            of HNSCC, frequently reside in the niche located in the tumor-associated stroma [

            proposed by Bankfalvi et al [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref021">21</span>]. The quantity scores were defined as follows: 0%, no positive cell; 1, 1%∼25%; 2,

            weak staining; 0, heterogeneously similar or strong staining; and 1, homogeneously
            similar or strong staining. Based on this scoring system, samples with scores from
            −1∼1 were categorized as CD44v9-negative and samples with scores from 2∼5 were categorized
            as CD44v9-positive.

         <p>A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to analyze the relevance of CD44v9 expression in

            induction and treatments effects in surgically removed specimens employing a Fisher’s
            exact test. To compare the disease-specific survival (DSS) rates between the specific
            groups, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated, and a Wilcoxon test was used to analyze
            the statistical differences. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard model
            were used to calculate the effects of clinicopathlogical factors on DSS rates. Values

            the other hand, the 72 surgical specimens showed the following distribution: score
            −1,0; score 0, 11; score, 1,30: score 2, 18; score 3, 13; score 4, 0; and score 5,
            0. Consequently, the CD44v9-positive rate was 53% (32/60) for the biopsy specimens,
            and 43% (31/72) for the surgical specimens. Three primary sites, oral cavity, hypopharynx
            and larynx, demonstrated similar expression levels of CD44v9 in the biopsy (
            <i>N</i> = 60,

            an increase in CD44v9 expression in the surgical specimens (designated as the CD44v9-induced

         <h3>Expression of CD44v9 in the biopsy specimens</h3>
         <p>To assess the clinical significance of the effect of intrinsic CD44v9 expression on
            chemoradioselection and patients survival, we compared the expression levels of CD44v9
            in the 60 untreated biopsy specimens obtained from CRS (
            <i>N</i> = 30) and N-CRS (
            <i>N</i> = 30) patients. There was no significant difference in CD44v9 expression levels between
            the CRS and N-CRS samples (
            <i>P</i> = 0.8289). In addition, CD44v9 positivity did not affect Kaplan-Meier DSS curves
            either in the CRS plus N-CRS cohort (
            <i>P</i> = 0.64; 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g003">Fig. 3B</span>) or in the N-CRS cohort (

            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g003">Fig. 3C</span>). Similar results were obtained with the univariate Cox proportional hazard model
            (HR: 1.086, 95% CI: 0.68–1.72; 
            <i>P</i> = 0.72). These results suggest that the expression levels of intrinsic CD44v9 in
            the biopsy specimens are not useful as a predictor of chemoradioselection and the
            patient survival.

         <h3>Expression of CD44v9 in the surgically removed specimens</h3>
         <p>In view of the above findings, we analyzed whether the expression levels of CCRT-induced
            CD44v9 were correlated with the unfavorable outcomes in the surgically removed specimens
            obtained from N-CRS patients. The basis for this analysis was the previous observation
            that induction chemotherapy apparently enhanced the subset of CD44v9-expressing cells
            in the HNSCC tumors [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref016">16</span>]. In N-CRS patients, the CD44v9-positive group (

            <u>S</u>S than the CD44v9-negative group (

            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g004">Fig. 4A</span>). Since it was confirmed that the primary tumor site didn’t affect the DSS as mentioned
            above, we examined the effects of four factors i.e., T, N, tumor responses to CCRT,
            and CD44v9 positivity on the DSS rate of patients by both univariate and multivariate
            analyses with a Cox proportional hazard model (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="pone.0116596.t002">Table 2</span>). The univariate analyses demonstrated significantly increased risks of disease-specific
            death in CD44v9-positive patients (HR: 2.033, 95% CI: 1.071–3.859; 
            <i>P</i> = 0.03) and with advanced N (HR: 3.091, 95% CI: 1.045–9.060; 
            <i>P</i> = 0.0397). In multivariate analyses, CD44v9 positivity (HR: 3.145, 95% CI: 1.235–8.008,
            
            <i>P</i> = 0.0163) and advanced N stage (HR: 3.525, 95% CI: 1.054–9.060, 
            <i>P</i> = 0.0228) were significantly correlated with poor prognosis (HR: 3.140, 95% CI: 1.230–8.017;
            
            <i>P</i> = 0.0167), suggesting that among these four factors, CD44v9 expression level is an
            useful biomarker in the N-CRS population, along with advanced N stage.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>During the last decade, the mainstay of treatment for advanced HNSCC has shifted from
         initial radical surgical resection combined with postoperative radiotherapy to dose-intensified
         treatment protocols, which are primarily aimed at organ preservation [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref023">23</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref024">24</span>]. This trend has been markedly advanced by the recent introduction of CCRT (e.g.,
         clinical trials led by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)) and sequential
         therapy comprising induction chemotherapy and CCRT (e.g., Tax 324 protocols), which
         have resulted in further improvements in organ preservation, locoregional control,
         and survival [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref025">25</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref028">28</span>]. Nonetheless, as indicated by recent studies or reviews, these protocols appear
         to have reached the upper limit of human tolerance of acute and sub-acute toxicities,
         which have caused frequent laryngoesophageal dysfunction and possible treatment-related
         deaths [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref029">29</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref031">31</span>]. Therefore, it appears necessary to decrease the current excessive intensity of
         treatment for advanced HNSCC by optimizing the therapeutic ratio. On the other hand,
         we have used a chemoradioselection strategy to avail complete advantages of radical
         resection and CCRT, while avoiding the severe acute and late toxicities. In our previous
         studies, CRS patients demonstrated significantly better survival with a functional
         larynx than N-CRS patients [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref003">3</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref005">5</span>], consistent with the findings of the present study. These results suggest that the
         chemoradioselection strategy may be a promising approach for advanced HNSCC, which
         can optimize the therapeutic ratio. However, it is obvious that the proportion of
         CRS patients should be increased to further improve the rates of organ preservation
         and patient survival. Identifying and targeting molecules that circumvent the effects
         of chemoradioselection appears to be a highly effective strategy to achieve this goal
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref001">1</span>]. As mentioned above, within the current conceptual framework of cancer biology,
         CSCs are probably the main causes of cellular refractoriness to CCRT; therefore, CS
         <u>C</u>s are expected to be related to the mechanism that attenuates the efficacy of chemoradioselection
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref001">1</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref009">9</span>].
      </p>
      <p>In this context, we hypothesized that in advanced HNSCC the expression of a putative
         CSC marker, CD44v9, may be responsible for the cellular resistance to chemoradioselection.
         Our data clearly demonstrated that the expression of CD44v9 was correlated with poor
         outcomes of patients treated with the chemoradioselection strategy, which confirmed
         our hypothesis. Moreover, we provided the first clinical evidence that CD44v9 may
         be a useful biomarker and consequently an exploitable molecular target in the treatment
         of advanced HNSCC. In addition, among other clinicopathological factors that have
         been used as conventional prognostic markers of HNSCC, the expression of CD44v9 was
         significantly related to the poor prognosis of patients in multivariate analyses,
         along with advanced N stage (
         <span ref-type="table" rid="pone.0116596.t002">Table 2</span>). It is of note that CD44v9 demonstrated the lower 
         <i>P</i>-value than N stage. Nonetheless, our findings that CCRT-induced CD44v9 expression
         rather than intrinsic expression had prognostic value should be interpreted carefully.
         Presumably, CD44v9 expression alone is not sufficient to indicate the property of
         stemness in cancer cells; CD44v9-expressing cancer cells are likely to be composed
         of CSCs and non-CSCs. Accordingly, the clinical significance of CD44v9 expression
         in the chemoradioselection strategy could be explained by at least 3 scenarios, as
         depicted in 
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g005">Fig. 5</span>. When tumors do not contain CD44v9-expressing CSCs, total cell killing by CCRT is
         feasible (i.e., CRS; 
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g005">Fig. 5A</span>). On the other hand, when tumors contain CD44v9-expressing CSCs they can survive
         CCRT (i.e., N-CRS; 
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g005">Fig. 5B</span>). Furthermore, there is a possibility that CCRT, working as a selective pressure,
         may induce stemness in CD44v9-expressing non-CSCs and lead to cancer cell survival
         (i.e., N-CRS; 
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g005">Fig. 5C</span>). These selective survivals of CSCs are considered to be sources of local invasion
         as well as regional and distant metastases, which then worsen the outcomes of N-CRS
         patients. The previous findings that induction chemotherapy increases the CD44v9-expressing
         cell population in oral cancer [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref016">16</span>], when taken together with our finding that CCRT-induced CD44v9 expression significantly
         correlates with poor prognosis, support our theory that chemo-/radiotherapy, in a
         given circumstance, may work as a force of selective sweep or selective pressure that
         drives HNSCC evolution, leading to the emergence of pluripotent CSCs [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref001">1</span>]. These scenarios (
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g005">Fig. 5</span>) appear to explain the reason why not the intrinsic, but the CCRT-induced CD44v9
         expression was useful as a biomarker in our chemoradioselection strategy. In the biopsy
         specimens, it is not feasible to specifically detect the CD44v9-expressing CSC or
         CD44v9-expressing non-CSC population that eventually acquire stemness after CCRT:
         i.e. to distinguish the pattern B and C from A. On the other hand, in the surgically
         removed samples of the N-CRS patients who underwent CCRT, the CD44v9-expressing cells
         are supposed to be highly enriched by CSCs, enhancing the value of CD44v9 expression
         as a biomarker.

               concurrent chemoradiotherapy; CRS, chemoradioselected; and N-CRS, non-chemoradioselected.

      <p>Sulfasalazine is a well-characterized specific inhibitor of xCT-mediated cystine transport
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref017">17</span>] and is therefore expected to deprive CD44v9-expressing cancer cells from the defense
         mechanism against ROS. Indeed, administration of sulfasalazine enhanced the intracellular
         activity of ROS in 
         <i>in vivo</i> assays [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref017">17</span>] and sensitized HNSCC cell lines to CDDP [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0116596.ref016">16</span>]. Therefore, it is expected that the combination therapy of sulfasalazine and CCRT
         may significantly enhance the effects of chemoradioselection by sensitizing both intrinsic
         and CCRT-induced CD44v9-expressing CSCs (
         <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0116596.g005">Fig. 5A and 5B</span>) to CCRT, and improve the outcomes of patients with advanced HNSCC. Given that sulfasalazine
         is a commercially available drug that has long been used to treat patients with ulcerative
         colitis and rheumatoid arthritis, clinical trials of this protocol are now under contemplation.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, CD44v9 targeting may provide a new approach to clinically feasible
         CSC-targeted therapy for HNSCC that can potentiate the efficacy of chemoradioselection
         and improve organ preservation and survival.
