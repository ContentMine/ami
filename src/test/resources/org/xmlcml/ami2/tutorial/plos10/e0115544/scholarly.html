         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>Comparing multiple, diverse outcomes with cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is important,
            yet challenging in areas like palliative care where domains are unamenable to integration
            with survival. Generic multi-attribute utility values exclude important domains and
            non-health outcomes, while partial analyses—where outcomes are considered separately,
            with their joint relationship under uncertainty ignored—lead to incorrect inference
            regarding preferred strategies. 
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sec002">
         <h2>Objective</h2>
         <p>The objective of this paper is to consider whether such decision making can be better
            informed with alternative presentation and summary measures, extending methods previously
            shown to have advantages in multiple strategy comparison.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sec003">
         <h2>Methods</h2>
         <p>Multiple outcomes CEA of a home-based palliative care model (PEACH) relative to usual
            care is undertaken in cost disutility (CDU) space and compared with analysis on the
            cost-effectiveness plane. Summary measures developed for comparing strategies across
            potential threshold values for multiple outcomes include: expected net loss (ENL)
            planes quantifying differences in expected net benefit; the ENL contour identifying
            preferred strategies minimising ENL and their expected value of perfect information;
            and cost-effectiveness acceptability planes showing probability of strategies minimising
            ENL.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="sec004">
         <h2>Results</h2>
         <p>Conventional analysis suggests PEACH is cost-effective when the threshold value per
            additional day at home (
            <div tagx="inline-formula">
               <div tagx="inline-graphic"></div>
            </div>
            <div tagx="sub">1</div>) exceeds $1,068 or dominated by usual care when only the proportion of home deaths
            is considered. In contrast, neither alternative dominate in CDU space where cost and
            outcomes are jointly considered, with the optimal strategy depending on threshold
            values. For example, PEACH minimises ENL when 
            <div tagx="inline-formula">
               <div tagx="inline-graphic"></div>
            </div>
            <div tagx="sub">1</div>=$2,000 and 
            <div tagx="inline-formula">
               <div tagx="inline-graphic"></div>
            </div>
            <div tagx="sub">2</div>=$2,000 (threshold value for dying at home), with a 51.6% chance of PEACH being cost-effective.

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>
         <p>Comparison in CDU space and associated summary measures have distinct advantages to
            multiple domain comparisons, aiding transparent and robust joint comparison of costs
            and multiple effects under uncertainty across potential threshold values for effect,
            better informing net benefit assessment and related reimbursement and research decisions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Conventional cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is limited to consideration of one
         measure of effect such as life years gained [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref001">1</span>]. However, when multiple outcome domains are important such single outcome comparison
         can lead to conflicting conclusions concerning preferred strategies [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref002">2</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref003">3</span>]. Consequently, decisions about the costs and benefits of funding allocations can
         be misinformed and lead to inefficient distribution of finite health care resources
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref002">2</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref004">4</span>].
      </p>
      <p>The widely applied quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measure overcomes this limitation
         to the extent that impacts on multiple domains of health can be integrated with survival
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref001">1</span>]. However, QALYs calculated using generic multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUIs)
         such as the EQ-5D [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref005">5</span>] focus upon health alone as the sole indicator of value. Empirical studies have shown
         that individuals may also gain utility from factors relating to the provision of health
         care [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref006">6</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref008">8</span>]. Economic analyses focusing on health alone do not enable robust coverage of the
         impacts of interventions in complex disease areas where multiple, diverse domains
         of effect are important. For example, in palliative care, many patients obtain value
         from receiving home-based rather than hospital care [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref009">9</span>].
      </p>
      <p>In palliative care, the use of the QALY measure is also limited by the:</p>
      <div tagx="list">
         <div tagx="list-item">
            <p>omission of important patient-valued domains from generic MAUIs, such as preparation

      </div>
      <p>One option might be to develop a condition-specific MAUI to incorporate palliative
         care-related effects of interest. Naturally, this would require identifying salient
         health and non-health related QOL domains and items for inclusion within each domain.
         Furthermore, confirmation of the content and construct validity and responsiveness
         of the condition-specific MAUI would be necessary [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref015">15</span>]. However, such research would be expected to take years to complete and still faces
         issues of how to weight or combine effects to inform societal decision making with
         the objective of maximising budget constrained net benefit (NB) across research, reimbursement
         and regulation decisions [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref016">16</span>]. Alternatively, cost-consequences analysis (CCA) [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref001">1</span>] with disaggregated mean costs and multiple outcomes explicitly presented has been
         advocated as a preferred method in these situations [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref017">17</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref018">18</span>]. However, in CCA, cost and multiple outcomes are treated separately without consideration
         of their interaction or joint uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>As Briggs et. al. argue in seminal papers on the death of cost-minimisation [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref019">19</span>], and cost effectiveness under uncertainty [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref020">20</span>], separate and sequential hypothesis tests on differences in outcomes and costs lead
         to fallacious inferences. It is important that CEA represents joint uncertainty associated
         with cost and outcomes so that funders and policy makers can make valid inferences
         and optimise across joint research, reimbursement, regulation and pricing decisions
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref016">16</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref021">21</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref022">22</span>]. Jointly evaluating costs with multiple effects and their potential values under
         uncertainty would enable robust and transparent trade offs between impacts of strategies
         and the NB of strategies under uncertainty and hence aid consideration of the consequences
         of reimbursement decisions. Further, if summary measures representing the expected
         value of perfect information were developed, these measures could start to address
         decisions related to the value of conducting future research relative to the cost
         of obtaining the additional information [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref016">16</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref021">21</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref023">23</span>]. Ultimately, economic evaluations can easily misrepresent the relative NB of palliative
         and end-of-life care without simultaneous consideration of costs and multiple outcome
         domains under uncertainty. Accessible, robust and generalisable methods for jointly
         comparing cost and multiple outcomes under uncertainty consistent with budget constrained
         maximisation of NB are needed to better inform funding decisions in such settings.
      </p>
      <p>For multiple strategy comparisons Eckermann et al. [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref024">24</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref026">26</span>] demonstrate distinct decision making advantages of: (i) presenting costs and effects
         on the cost-disutility (CDU) plane, with effects framed from a utility reducing perspective,
         e.g. mortality, morbidity or reduction in QALYs, and flexible axes where costs and
         effects are measured relative to the least costly and most effective strategies respectively;
         and (ii) simply calculated expected net loss (ENL) curves and frontiers for each strategy
         which identify both the optimal strategy in minimising ENL at any threshold value
         and their expected value of perfect information (EVPI). This paper extends these methods
         to consider multiple outcomes under uncertainty and whether and how such comparison
         can be used to better inform societal decision making when optimising budget constrained
         NB.
      </p>
      <p>The next section summarises conventional CCA and CEA applied to compare multiple outcomes
         with alternative palliative care models. The new methodology, multiple outcomes comparison
         in CDU space, and associated summary measures are then introduced and illustrated.
         The relative merits of these alternative methods for multiple outcomes CEA are discussed
         in palliative care settings and more generally with multi-criteria decision analysis
         (MCDA) and finally conclusions and implications are drawn.

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>The cost effectiveness of a home-based palliative care model (Palliative Care Extended
         Packages at Home (PEACH)) which aimed to expedite discharge and enable patients to
         remain at home is evaluated relative to usual care using participant-level data from
         a pilot study. Full details of the economic evaluation are presented elsewhere [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref027">27</span>]. Ethics approval for the pilot study was granted by Sydney South West Area Health
         Service Human Research Ethics Committees. Written informed consent was obtained from
         the pilot study participants.

      <div id="sec008">
         <h3>Cost-consequences and cost-effectiveness analyses</h3>
         <p>Mean incremental per patient effects and net costs were calculated for PEACH relative
            to usual care including: days at home; place of death; PEACH intervention costs; costs
            of specialist palliative care service use; and costs of acute hospital and palliative
            care unit inpatient stays and outpatient visits. Net benefit (
            <span ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0115544.e001">Equation 1</span>) was calculated to address analytical and inferential shortcomings of the incremental
            cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), while retaining the same underlying cost effectiveness
            objective [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref020">20</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref028">28</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref031">31</span>]. Under the NB approach, an intervention is considered cost- effective if, at specified
            decision-maker threshold values, the monetary value of the incremental effects is
            greater than the incremental costs i.e., incremental net benefit (INB) is positive
            (see 
            <span ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0115544.e002">Equation 2</span>) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref024">24</span>]. The intervention with the greatest INB is considered the most cost-effective in
            multiple intervention comparison. In budget constrained health systems, threshold
            values for effects should be the health shadow price for a unit gain of effect reflecting
            opportunity cost and maximisation of health system outcomes, i.e. represent the best
            alternative way of achieving the same effects [

            <p>Reframing effects from a utility-reducing perspective and comparing strategies on

               improves with equi-proportionally contraction of costs and effects to the origin.
               Importantly, these radial properties enable efficiency measures invariant to scale
               of axes, unlike non-radial efficiency measures [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref037">37</span>] and allow conventional economic, technical and allocative efficiency measures [

               analysis (DEA) or index methods. Generally, employing input-orientated DEA, a piecewise,

               be proportionally contracted with the feasible set (convex combination of other strategies)

            <p>With deterministic analysis the preferred model of care is the model which minimises
               mean NL at any given combination of threshold values, i.e.

               <div tagx="sub">2</div> is minimised. Therefore, strategy

            <h3>Stochastic cost-effectiveness analyses (accounting for joint uncertainty)</h3>
            <p>Bootstrapping methods allow modelling of uncertainty across the joint distribution
               of incremental costs and multiple incremental outcomes from the participant-level
               data, allowing for covariance between costs and effects [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref040">40</span>]. The following measures are calculated using the bootstrap replicates and summarise
               the expected return on investment and risk of return across potential threshold values
               for multiple outcomes given current uncertainty.
            </p>
            <p>Choosing a strategy that does not minimise the NL incurs an incremental NL relative
               to the optimal strategy. For each service model, at a given set of threshold values
               the NL relative to the NB maximising strategy in each replicate is calculated and
               averaged across 10,000 replicates to estimate ENL [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref024">24</span>]. An expected loss arises for the proportion of replicates in which the service model
               does not maximise the NB at the specified threshold values, reflecting decision uncertainty
               given current trial evidence.
            </p>
            <p>As in the case of ENL curves for a single effect [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref022">22</span>], ENL planes quantify differences in ENL across models of care for different combinations
               of values for effects. ENL planes are formed by varying the threshold values for the
               multiple effects and re-calculating the average ENL across replicates for each model
               of care. The distance between planes represents the difference in ENL between models
               of care at any set of threshold values for effects under uncertainty [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref024">24</span>].
            </p>
            <p>The contour is formed by the lower bound of the ENL planes across models of care,
               i.e. the lowest ENL values at combinations of threshold values are determined from
               consideration of both planes, analogous to the ENL frontier as the lower bound of
               ENL curves [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref016">16</span>, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref024">24</span>]. The contour readily identifies the service model that minimises ENL for any set
               of values [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref022">22</span>] for 𝕜
               <div tagx="sub">1</div> and 𝕜
               <div tagx="sub">2</div>in the case of the PEACH study.
            </p>
            <p>The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is the loss from a bad decision that
               could be avoided with perfect, rather than current information [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref021">21</span>]. As with the ENL frontier, the ENL contour naturally represents the EVPI per patient
               associated with choosing the strategy minimising ENL [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref016">16</span>, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref024">24</span>] given current uncertainty, but as a function of threshold values for multiple rather
               than single effects.
            </p>
            <p>Cost-effectiveness acceptability planes (CEAPs) show the probability that each model
               of care minimises ENL conditional on threshold values for multiple effects. For each
               model of care, the CEAP is formed by determining the proportion of replicates that
               minimise ENL for different combinations of threshold values for effects.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>When assessing the cost effectiveness of interventions with multiple outcomes, presentation
         in CDU space and use of ENL planes and contours to summarise cost effectiveness has
         been illustrated to overcome limitations of conventional CEA and CCA analysis. Partial
         analysis, where individual outcomes and costs are considered separately, suggested
         PEACH is associated with higher costs and increased benefits over 28 days relative
         to usual care when time spent at home was the sole measure considered. However, PEACH
         was dominated by usual care when the proportion of home deaths alone was considered.
         These results illustrate that choice of effect where analysis is restricted to single
         effect substantially alters cost-effectiveness inferences. In comparison, neither
         service model dominated in CDU space, when incremental cost and multiple outcomes
         were jointly considered. Compared with CCA the proposed approach has distinct advantages
         in allowing for joint uncertainty of incremental cost and outcomes, and cost effectiveness.
         If societal decision making asymptotes to risk neutrality [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref026">26</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref041">41</span>] then findings suggest PEACH maximises expected NB when 𝕜
         <div tagx="sub">1</div> &gt; 0.25𝕜
         <div tagx="sub">2</div> + $1,068. If preferences are somewhat risk-averse, trade-offs may also arise between
         minimising ENL and maximising the probability of minimising ENL across compared strategies
         for discrete regions of threshold values.
      </p>
      <p>This paper extends previous work showing advantages of the CDU plane for comparing
         multiple strategies. Cost and multiple effects of alternative models of care are clearly
         presented in CDU space, facilitating identification, presentation and exploration
         of trade-offs between effects. Collectively, the new summary measures compared expected
         NB between strategies across any set of feasible threshold values for multiple effects
         and the impact of joint uncertainty. Threshold regions display the combinations of
         values over which alternative models of care minimise mean NL or equivalently maximise
         NB. ENL planes present differences in ENL between alternatives, while the ENL contour
         simultaneously establishes: (i) the intervention that minimises ENL; and (ii) EVPI
         with current evidence. Finally, CEAPs estimate the probability that interventions
         minimise ENL. This may be of particular interest across discrete threshold regions
         where the model of care with the lowest ENL does not have the greatest probability
         of minimising ENL if societal decision making remains somewhat risk averse [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref041">41</span>]. However, it should be stressed that CEAPs, like CEACs, do not directly identify
         the strategy that minimises ENL [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref025">25</span>], unlike ENL planes and contours. The summary measures presented in this paper allow
         decision-makers to explicitly trade off expected return on investment with the risk
         of return at different relative and absolute threshold values for multiple outcomes.

      <p>Contemporary economic evaluation methods are limited when comparing interventions
         with multiple outcomes. Although CCA explicitly presents multiple outcomes and costs,
         they are considered independently rather than jointly when allowing for uncertainty.
         Also, this approach does not allow for differences in ENB. Multiple outcomes comparison
         in CDU space retains advantages of CCA in comparing multiple outcomes while additionally
         allowing rigorous assessment of joint uncertainty across multiple outcomes and estimation
         of differences in ENL. Furthermore, the ability of the methods developed to allow
         for different relative preferences [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref042">42</span>] is also valuable for informing individual patient and population level decisions
         under uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>Cost-benefit analysis could include multiple effects. However, this approach is limited
         by the difficulties of valuing health outcomes in monetary terms and the influence
         of ability to pay on willingness to pay [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref043">43</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref044">44</span>]. Multiple outcomes comparison in CDU space allows explicit exploration of relative
         and absolute monetary values for multiple outcomes on preferred strategies. Further,
         this approach permits robust analysis of the impact of uncertainty around monetary
         threshold values with ENL contours.
      </p>
      <p>Cost-effectiveness analysis is limited by a uni-dimensional measure, where choice
         of outcome can give rise to outcome selection bias as illustrated in this paper. Cost-utility
         analysis (CUA) is limited by narrowly defined health-related QOL domains in the commonly
         applied generic MAUIs which exclude important domains unable to be integrated with
         patient survival in complex disease areas such as palliative care, e.g. utility from
         preparing for death [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref045">45</span>], carer and family impacts and non-health outcomes [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref046">46</span>]. The novel methodology presented in this paper enables simultaneous evaluation of
         such diverse domains of effect.
      </p>
      <p>Previously there have been only a few attempts to develop specific methods to evaluate
         and present costs and multiple outcomes under uncertainty in an explicit manner. Bjorner
         and Keiding [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref047">47</span>] proposed a relative cost-effectiveness measure. Negrin and Vazquez-Polo [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref048">48</span>] presented an alternative Bayesian cost-effectiveness framework. The Bjorner and
         Keiding approach compares the performance of each intervention relative to the worst
         performing intervention in a set of interventions using DEA [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref047">47</span>]. However, their relative cost-effectiveness measure does not inform decisions between
         non-dominated interventions, nor allow consideration of stochastic uncertainty, or
         allow estimation of the probability of maximising expected NB. The Bayesian methodology
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref048">48</span>] graphically represents the intervention most likely to maximise NB at various combinations
         of threshold values for multiple outcomes using a cost-effectiveness acceptability
         frontier. Geometrically, this is similar to the CEAP derived from comparison in CDU
         space. However, neither of these previous approaches provides summary measures for
         quantifying differences in ENB between strategies under uncertainty, which is the
         critical comparison required to inform risk-neutral or somewhat risk-averse decision
         making [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref025">25</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref041">41</span>].
      </p>
      <p>In this paper, the NBCT is applied with CEA to inform health technology assessment.
         Similarly, the novel approach to multiple outcome comparison illustrated here could
         be applied to compare multiple outcomes, objectives and facets of chronic disease
         management programs [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref049">49</span>], health promotion and disease prevention in complex community care settings [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref050">50</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref056">56</span>]. Multiple aspects relevant to such comparisons might include self-management capability,
         co-ordination and process aspects of care, network impacts and community uptake and
         ownership of promotion interventions in complex settings. Other forms of multiple
         criteria decision analysis (MCDA) have been proposed to allow for multiple objectives
         and outcomes in some of these settings [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref057">57</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref058">58</span>]. The NBCT [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref024">24</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref026">26</span>] applied to multiple outcomes [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref059">59</span>] would enable a comparison of such multiple criteria consistent with maximising NB
         and is summarised with ENL planes and contours. Unlike CEACs [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref058">58</span>] and other transformations proposed, the ENL planes and contour and ENL curves and
         frontiers [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref024">24</span>] are consistent with differences in ENB. This is particularly important given the
         primary importance under the Arrow-Lind theorem [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref041">41</span>] to compare differences in ENB and avoid confounding of relevant probabilities between

         strategy comparisons [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref025">25</span>]. Consequently, application of the proposed methodology in alternative health promotion
         and prevention settings as well as disease areas, with their associated multiple effects
         or criteria of interest for decision making are suggested as valuable. Applying the
         values and preferences of individuals, different patient populations and societal
         decision makers across jurisdictions for relevant multiple outcomes should be considered
         in future research to further demonstrate the flexibility of this approach.

      <p>If the threshold values for effects in NB are to aid optimization of health outcomes
         from a fixed budget then assuming the new technology or strategy has net costs the
         threshold value should reflect the opportunity cost of reimbursement in adopting and
         financing the new service, technology or strategy [

         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref034">34</span>]. That is, the opportunity cost of reimbursing a new technology is the most cost-effective
         expansion of existing services financed by contraction or displacement of the least
         cost-effective service. The opportunity cost and threshold value should be estimated
         allowing for characteristic allocative and displacement inefficiency in health systems
         where the least cost-effective program in contraction (ICER = 
         <i>m</i>) has a higher ICER than the most cost-effective program in expansion (ICER = 
         <i>n</i>) and displaced services (ICER = 
         <i>d</i>). The health shadow price derived by Pekarsky [

         <i>d &lt; m</i>) to reflect the opportunity cost of best alternative adoption and financing actions
         in reimbursing new technology.

      <p>The health shadow price threshold has a value of 
         <i>n</i>, equivalent to the ICER of the most cost-effective expansion of current programs
         if displacement is efficient (
         <i>d</i> = 
         <i>m</i>), but is less than 
         <i>n</i> where displacement is suboptimal (

         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115544.ref022">22</span>]. In the case of multiple effects the associated threshold values should be determined
         by their relevant health shadow prices as these represent the best alternative way

      <p>Multiple outcomes analysis in CDU space with use of the ENL contour as a summary measure

         <h3>Limitations</h3>
         <p>Despite distinct advantages over existing methods for multiple outcome comparisons,
            there are some issues to consider. While multiple outcomes comparison presented in
            CDU space enables flexible and robust comparison under uncertainty, as with other
            multiple outcome approaches issues of valuation and trade-offs between outcomes arise.
            Relative decision-maker threshold values are required for funding or policy decisions
            in any jurisdiction of interest for their population, practice, and preferences conditional
            on the budget constrained decision context whether based on cost-effectiveness, cost-utility
            or cost-benefit analyses. Multiple outcomes comparison in CDU space, unlike alternative
            methods, enables explicit joint comparison of costs and multiple outcomes prior to
            valuation and encourages explicit valuation and acknowledgment of trade-offs between
            outcomes in the decision-making process. These issues are particularly important where
            the maximand for cost-effectiveness analysis is not stated. In cost-utility analyses,
            multiple threshold valuation also occurs for different outcomes or domains within
            the MAUI but is less explicit or readily identified. Generally, valuing effects should,
            as with the proposed approach, be explicit to enable appropriate translation of impacts
            to decision making in different contexts.
         </p>
         <p>The methodology presented can be applied to any number of strategies and any number
            and types of outcome measures. However, whilst graphical presentation for comparison
            is feasible in two- and three-dimensional space, further dimensions cannot be easily
            graphically represented in ways that are currently familiar in societal decision-making.
            Similarly, knowledge of frontier methods such as DEA may be restricted to those with
            mathematical or economic backgrounds and hence application of these methods to fully
            exploit the benefits of multiple outcomes comparison in CDU space could require educational
            support to aid knowledge translation. Despite this, the general formulae promote transferability
            of the method across different populations and jurisdictions given different values
            can be imputed for each outcome depending on perspective and context.
         </p>
         <p>Further research is required to exploit the societal decision making advantages of
            robustly comparing multiple outcomes and multiple strategies in CDU space illustrated
            in this paper. Application of the approach in alternative disease areas, with different
            numbers of multiple effects and/or strategies would be particularly valuable. The
            views of bodies and individuals involved in societal-decision making on the relative
            merits of alternative presentation and summary measures for evaluating the cost-effectiveness
            of interventions with multiple effects could also be sought to explore the interface
            between theoretical and practical advantages and lead to further development of the
            methodology in practice.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Better methods are needed to compare the cost effectiveness of alternative strategies
         with multiple outcomes under uncertainty in complex service delivery areas such as
         palliative care. On the cost-effectiveness plane analysis is restricted to one outcome
         and not all outcome domains can be integrated with survival in estimating QALYs. Furthermore,
         cost-consequences analyses fail to allow for joint uncertainty across outcomes. Comparison
         in CDU space with ENL planes, contours and CEAPS have been shown to allow presentation
         of uncertainty across multiple outcomes with summary measures quantifying differences
         in ENB and the probability of maximising ENB at any given set of threshold values
         for multiple outcomes. Incorrect inferences are avoided using these presentation and
         summary measures and risk-neutral or somewhat risk-averse societal decision making
         better informed, while the potential value of future research (EVPI) is also estimated.
         In summary, analysis in CDU space provides a readily accessible and systematic way
         to compare multiple outcomes in CEA and NB assessment under uncertainty. In comparing
         multiple strategies a more robust picture of the likely trade-offs between costs and
         benefits, the consequences of funding decisions and the need for future research reduces
         inferential errors and better informs societal decisions [
