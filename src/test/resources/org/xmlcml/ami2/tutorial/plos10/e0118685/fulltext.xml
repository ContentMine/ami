ECTV and variola virus (VARV), the agent of smallpox, are closely related orthopoxviruses. Mousepox is an excellent small animal model to study the genetic and immunologic basis for resistance and susceptibility of humans to smallpox. Resistance to mousepox is dependent on a strong polarized type 1 immune response, associated with robust natural killer (NK) cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and gamma interferon (IFN-&#x003b3;) responses. In contrast, ECTV-susceptible mice generate a type 2 response, associated with weak NK cell, CTL and IFN-&#x003b3; responses but robust IL-4 responses. Nonetheless, susceptible strains infected with mutant ECTV lacking virus-encoded IFN-&#x003b3; binding protein (vIFN-&#x003b3;bp) (ECTV-IFN-&#x003b3;bp<sup>&#x00394;</sup>) control virus replication through generation of type 1 response. Since the IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways polarize type 2/T helper 2 (Th2) responses with a corresponding suppression of IFN-&#x003b3; production, we investigated whether the combined absence of vIFN-&#x003b3;bp, and one or more host genes involved in Th2 response development, influence generation of protective immunity. Most mutant mouse strains infected with wild-type (WT) virus succumbed to disease more rapidly than WT animals. Conversely, the disease outcome was significantly improved in WT mice infected with ECTV-IFN-&#x003b3;bp<sup>&#x00394;</sup> but absence of IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways did not provide any added advantage. Deficiency in IL-13 or STAT-6 resulted in defective CTL responses, higher mortality rates and accelerated deaths. Deficiencies in IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways significantly reduced the numbers of IFN-&#x003b3; producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, indicating an absence of a switch to a Th1-like response. Factors contributing to susceptibility or resistance to mousepox are far more complex than a balance between Th1 and Th2 responses.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/">https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/</ext-link>) grant numbers APP1007980 and 471426.

VARV is an orthopoxvirus (OPV) that causes smallpox, a disease that has killed more humans than all other infectious diseases combined [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As the disease was eradicated more than 30 years ago, animal models of OPV infections have been used to establish strong causal relationships and map the requirements for protection against infection in a way that is not possible in humans. ECTV is a natural pathogen of mice that causes a generalized infection known as mousepox, an excellent small animal model to study the pathogenesis of smallpox [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both VARV and ECTV cause acute infections in their respective hosts, which either succumb to infection or clear the virus with complete recovery.</p><p>Resistance to mousepox is dependent on rapid generation of a strong polarized type 1 immune response [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. ECTV-resistant C57BL/6 mice generate robust NK cell, CTL, and IFN-&#x003b3; responses whereas in ECTV-susceptible BALB/c mice these responses are sub-optimal but high levels of IL-4 is produced. Loss of IFN-&#x003b3; function in resistant mice [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or over-expression of IL-4 by recombinant ECTV encoding IL-4, which abrogates IFN-&#x003b3; production [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] results in ineffective NK cell and CTL responses and fulminant disease. The existence of virus-encoded host response modifiers that specifically target type 1 cytokines further underscores the importance of these factors in immunity to poxvirus infections [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Indeed, BALB/c mice infected with a deletion mutant virus lacking vIFN-&#x003b3;bp (ECTV-IFN-&#x003b3;bp<sup>&#x00394;</sup>) are able to contain virus replication and overcome the infection [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Absence of vIFN-&#x003b3;bp increases IFN-&#x003b3; production and as a consequence, augments cell-mediated immunity and virus control.</p><p>The cytokine milieu and cell subset-selective transcription factors play important roles in the differentiation of uncommitted naive CD4 T cells into Th1 and Th2 subsets following antigenic stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-4 play dominant roles in the development of Th1 and Th2 subsets, respectively. IL-4 mediates its activity through the IL-4 receptor (R), which consists of a heterodimeric complex between IL-4R&#x003b1; and the common &#x003b3; chain [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. IL-4R&#x003b1; also associates with the low affinity IL-13R&#x003b1;1 to form a high affinity receptor for both IL-13 and IL-4. A second IL-13 receptor, IL-13R&#x003b1;2, which exists in a monomeric form, can bind to IL-13 with high affinity and modulate IL-13 responses [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Binding of IL-4 to IL-4R activates the transcription factor STAT-6, which in turn controls expression of GATA3, the master transcription regulator required for Th2 differentiation [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. IL-13 is also capable of activating STAT-6 and shares many of the biological properties of IL-4.</p><p>A previous report pointed to a role for STAT-6 signaling and IL-4 production in contributing to susceptibility of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. STAT-6 deficient mice infected with ECTV-WT were better protected through generation of more effective NK cell and IFN-&#x003b3; responses that allowed the otherwise susceptible animals to overcome infection. Curiously, IL-4 deficiency in BALB/c mice has no impact on disease outcome [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], implying that other factors like IL-13 may be sufficient to drive Th2-like responses in the absence of IL-4.</p><p>Since the generation of protective immunity and the outcome of a viral infection are influenced by both viral and host genes, we hypothesized that infection of gene knockout (GKO) BALB/c mice lacking one or more factors associated with Th2 response development with ECTV-WT or ECTV-IFN-&#x003b3;bp<sup>&#x00394;</sup> would further augment the Th1 response and influence disease outcome. Contrary to our prediction, the disease was exacerbated in most groups of BALB/c mice lacking one or more components of Th2 signaling pathways compared to WT mice infected with WT virus. Conversely, the disease outcome was significantly improved in WT mice infected with the mutant virus, but absence of the IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways did not provide any added advantage to the host. In fact, there were higher rates of mortality and accelerated deaths amongst mice deficient in IL-13 or STAT-6 compared with WT animals. Deficiency in IL-13 or STAT-6 dramatically reduced the antiviral CTL response. Furthermore, deficiencies in IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways significantly reduced the numbers of IFN-&#x003b3; producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, indicating an absence of a switch to a Th1-like response. Thus, although recovery from ECTV infection is strongly influenced, in part, by a balance between the host&#x02019;s ability to produce IFN-&#x003b3; and the virus&#x02019; ability to dampen its effects [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], our data indicate that factors contributing to disease susceptibility are far more complex than a balance between Th1 and Th2 responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Australian code of practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Guidelines and Policies on Animal Ethics and approved by the Animal Ethics and Experimentation Committee of the Australian National University (Protocol numbers J.IG. 62/08, J.IG. 75.09 and A2012/041).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Mice</title><p>Gene knockout (GKO) mice lacking IL-4 [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], IL-13 [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], IL-4R&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], STAT-6 [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or both IL-13 and IL-4R&#x003b1; were either generated on a BALB/c background or backcrossed to the BALB/cJ strain for at least 10 generations or more.

While it may be speculated that type 1-like responses were important for recovery of humans from smallpox, there is circumstantial evidence that Th2-biased responses can significantly exacerbate the disease and result in increased mortality.</p><p>In non-vaccinated humans, about 90% of cases were of the ordinary-type smallpox with a case fatality rate of about 30&#x02013;40% [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A more severe form of the disease, hemorrhagic-type smallpox, characterized by mucosal and skin hemorrhage, was mainly seen in pregnant women. Early hemorrhagic-type smallpox was associated with almost 100% mortality regardless of vaccination status and pregnant women with smallpox had 3&#x02013;4 times higher case fatality rates than non-pregnant women and men of the same age groups [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although the reasons for higher case fatality rates were not known at the time when smallpox was endemic, it is now recognized that an immune bias towards a Th2-like response associated with pregnancy [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] may have been responsible. That Th2-biased response can exacerbate smallpox even in vaccinated individuals is significant. In this regard, the demonstration that infection of previously vaccinated mice with recombinant ECTV encoding IL-4 can completely overcome protective immunity and genetic resistance [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] helped establish that over exuberant Th2-biased responses increase susceptibility to OPV infections. This raises the question of whether defective or sub-optimal Th2 responses allow for the generation of more effective antiviral immunity. Our results indicate they do not.</p><p>Deficiencies in IL-4, STAT-6, IL-13 and/or IL-4R&#x003b1; signaling on immune response generation were varied and further modulated by vIFN-&#x003b3;bp but 3 broad categories of outcomes were evident. In the first, the IL-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had comparable recovery rates to WT mice regardless of whether they were infected with WT or mutant virus. In the second, the IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WT virus infection but the absence of vIFN-&#x003b3;bp during infection mitigated the increased susceptibility. Finally, mice deficient in IL-13 or STAT-6 were significantly more susceptible than WT animals in response to WT or mutant virus infection. Susceptibility to ECTV is attributed to uncontrolled generalized virus replication in visceral organs, including in the liver [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], spleen and blood [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, in the current study, viral load in organs and blood 7 days after infection did not consistently correlate with increased susceptibility, with the exception of STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This outcome is surprising and might have been a consequence of the extent to which deficiencies in IL-4, IL-13 and/or IL-4R&#x003b1;, combined with immunomodulation by vIFN-&#x003b3;bp impacted on inflammation, the immune response and virus control. Viral load in the liver and spleen generally increase exponentially over time if not effectively controlled by the immune response. However, the blood viral load is usually only increased following primary, secondary and subsequent occurrence of viremia following release of virions from the visceral organs. It is possible that kinetics of virus replication in the different GKO mouse strains was different and measurement of viral load at a single time-point might not have revealed the extent to which the viruses replicated and spread. However, the fact that most GKO mice succumbed to mousepox at or after 6 days post-infection suggests that measurement of viral titers at day 7 should have indicated if uncontrolled virus replication was the cause of death. Another finding of note is that deficiency in IL-13 or IL-4R&#x003b1; resulted in comparable viral titers in liver, spleen and blood but titers were lower in the liver and blood in IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. While the reason for this is unclear, it might be explained, at least in part by the CTL responses generated in the absence of IL-13 or both IL-13 and IL-4R&#x003b1; (see below).</p><p>Absence of IL-4, STAT-6, IL-13 or IL-4R&#x003b1; signaling clearly had a significant impact on both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, which were modulated to some extent by vIFN-&#x003b3;bp. Contrary to our prediction, the numbers of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as IL-4<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells were decreased in all GKO strains compared to WT mice. Absence of vIFN-&#x003b3;bp during infection had minimal effects on CD4 T cell responses with the exception of STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in which mutant virus infection significantly increased IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cell numbers. The most striking reductions in the anti-ECTV CTL responses were seen with WT virus infected STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which were almost completely reversed when these strains were infected with ECTV-IFN-&#x003b3;bp<sup>&#x00394;</sup>. Deficiency in the IL-4R&#x003b1; alone did not have any impact on the CTL response but in the IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the significant reduction in CTL activity was partially reversed when IL-4R&#x003b1; was also absent. This is an interesting finding and although the mechanisms involved are not known, it suggests that in the absence of IL-13, IL-4 signaling through the IL-R&#x003b1; was far more detrimental to induction of antiviral CTL responses than in the complete absence of IL-4 and IL-13 responses in IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/IL-4R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. We speculate that IL-13 might modulate the IL-4 response in induction of ECTV-specific CTL responses. Another important finding in the STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is the complete lack of reactivity of CD8 T cells to any of the H-2d determinants that were tested. One explanation for the complete lack of reactivity to the three H-2<sup>d</sup>-restricted viral determinants in the STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> strain is that the response might have been directed against other determinants. It is also possible that results could be influenced by subtle changes in reactivity of cells maturing in a STAT-6-deficient environment. Such changes in immune responses may be due to altered peptide expression that might be negligible or difficult to identify or quantify, but should nonetheless be considered for investigations in our future studies. It is curious why Th2-response linked genes influence the reactivity of CD8 T responses but may be related, at least in part, to potential defects in antigen presentation by dendritic cells as discussed below.</p><p>Although IFN-&#x003b3; impacts on the quality and magnitude of the anti-ECTV CTL response [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], it was evident that the augmented CTL activity in IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was not related to the marginally increased numbers of virus-specific IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD8 cells, which occurred in all GKO strains. It is also possible that factors other than CD8 T cell-derived IFN-&#x003b3; influenced the cytolytic activity of CTL in IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. As CD4 T cells are important for generation of optimal CTL responses to ECTV infection [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], we considered the possibility that IFN-&#x003b3;-producing CD4 T cells may have impacted on the magnitude of CTL responses. While this might have been the case in STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals (<xref rid="pone.0118685.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) in which numbers of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4 cells substantially increased following infection with the mutant virus, it did not hold true for the IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. There is therefore little or no evidence for any consistent correlation between the numbers of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells and the magnitude of the CD8 T cell-mediated CTL responses in individual mouse strains.</p><p>STAT-6-dependent IL-4 production has been purported to be associated with susceptibility of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] but IL-4 deficiency in BALB/c mice has no impact on disease outcome [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Since IL-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice can respond to IL-13, we hypothesized that the cytokine might compensate for absence of IL-4 to drive Th2-like responses. Our data established that this was not the case and that the responses to, and outcome of infection with, ECTV in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>mice are very different. First, IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were far more susceptible to WT or mutant virus infection than IL-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Second, the CTL response to WT virus was marginally reduced in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to WT animals, but the effect was far more significant in IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This is an important and novel finding in that factors normally associated with Th2 responses play critical and non-redundant roles in the generation of optimal antiviral CD8 CTL responses. The mechanism(s) through which IL-13 or STAT-6 impact on CTL responses generation during ECTV infection is currently unknown but merit a detailed investigation.</p><p>Na&#x000ef;ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in IL-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and STAT6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice express lower levels of IL-4R&#x003b1; making them less responsive to IL-4 and IL-13 during T cell priming [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

In relation to the role of STAT-6 in CTL responses, it has been reported that the activation and function of CTL may be impaired in STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice during infection with the intracellular parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, likely as a consequence of reduced levels of CD86 expression on DC [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The demonstration that activation of CD8 T cells in STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was restored after transfer of splenic adherent cells or bone-marrow derived DC from WT mice whereas transfer of na&#x000ef;ve WT CD8 T cells into STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were not activated suggested a defect in antigen presentation [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is known that <italic>in vitro</italic>, IL-13, like IL-4, in combination with GM-CSF can induce generation of functional DC [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], suggesting that IL-13 may be important in differentiation of DC via STAT-6 signaling. We speculate that IL-4R/IL-13R-associated STAT-6 signaling might be important in CD8 T cell activation and function during ECTV infection, possibly through maturation of antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC). Apart from promoting the expression of several cell surface molecules responsible for antigen presentation; including MHC II, CD80, and CD86, IL-4/STAT-6 signaling regulates T-cell proliferation by decreasing the expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, a known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. In CD8 cells, STAT6 is required for Tc2 differentiation as the production of IL-4 and IL-5 is completely lost with STAT6 deficiency (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]). Taken together, STAT6 is required for IL-4-stimulated T-cell functions.</p><p>That STAT-6 deficiency further exacerbates susceptibility of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection is in stark contrast to a previous report in which STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were found to be more resistant than WT BALB/c mice due to augmented NK cell and IFN-&#x003b3; responses [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In the current study, apart from a 2&#x02013;3-fold increase in the cytolytic activity of NK cells in STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, all other responses were either far worse or no different to WT mice. We believe that there may be a simple explanation for this discrepancy. In the present study we used STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that were backcrossed to the BALB/c background for at least 10 generations [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the previous study, STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice generated on a 129 background [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and backcrossed to the BALB/c background for only 6 generations were used. Given that several of the 129 sub-strains are resistant to mousepox [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we believe that the 129/Sv background genes may have influenced the outcome of infection in that study. It is likely that STAT-6 deficiency in ECTV-resistant C57BL/6 or 129 mouse strains might further augment Th1 responses but this is not the case in the ECTV-susceptible BALB/c mice. Consistent with this proposition, we have found that C57BL/6 mice deficient in IL-4 generate more robust CTL and IFN-&#x003b3; responses which correlated with more efficient virus control compared to WT littermate controls (data not shown). Furthermore, when the STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice used in the previous study [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] were backcrossed to the BALB/c background 10&#x02013;12 times, they were found to be more susceptible to ECTV-WT infection than WT littermates (data not shown). Clearly, STAT-6 deficiency does not increase the resistance of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection. On the contrary, STAT-6 deficiency further increased susceptibility of the BALB/c strain to ECTV.</p><p>Our finding that deficiencies in IL-4/IL-13/STAT-6 signaling pathways significantly reduced the numbers of IFN-&#x003b3; producing CD4 and CD8 T cells indicates an absence of a switch to a Th1-like response and might be unique to this viral model. For example, Th1/Th2 cytokine production by IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells is varied depending on <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> stimulation conditions and the type of cells involved [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. IL-13 deficient splenocytes or CD4 T cells stimulated with mitogens produce reduced levels of IL-4 but similar levels of IFN-&#x003b3; compared to WT cells. Under Th1/Th2 culture conditions, IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> CD4 T cells produce dramatically reduced levels of IL-4 but only a 2-fold higher amount of IFN-&#x003b3;. In contrast, mast cells from IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice stimulated with PMA and ionomycin produce comparable levels of IL-4. <italic>In vivo</italic>, challenge of IL-13<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with schistosome eggs reduced IL-4 levels only by about 3-fold whereas challenge with the parasite <italic>N</italic>. <italic>brasiliensis</italic> had no impact on Th2 response generation or IL-4 production by lymph node cells or purified CD4 T cells.</p><p>It is conceivable that regulation of Th2 response generation <italic>in vivo</italic> during infection with a virus is far more complex than how it is understood to occur in <italic>in vitro</italic> culture conditions. Various stimuli, cell types and signalling pathways are involved in orchestrating Th2 responses of which there are also variants [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Indeed, Th2 differentiation has been shown to occur in mice that are deficient in IL-4, IL-13, IL-4R&#x003b1; or STAT-6 and cytokines like thymic stromal lymphopoietin, IL-25 and IL-33 can induce Th2 responses [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. There is consensus, however, that GATA3 is required for this process, even if expressed at low levels [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In the current study, we found that numbers of GATA3<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells were highest in both WT and IL-4<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice infected with WT virus but numbers were reduced in the GKO strains. These strains also had the highest number of T-bet<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. T-bet can negatively regulate GATA3 [<xref rid="pone.0118685.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and in STAT-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, T-bet<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cell numbers were increased with a corresponding decrease in GATA-3<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. These changes, however, did not translate to an increase in IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. Overall, there was little correlation between GATA-3 and IL-4 expression or T-bet and IFN-&#x003b3; expression in CD4 T cells regardless of the type of infecting virus. We believe that the use of transgenic CD4 and CD8 T cells, specific for a model antigen, and deficient in IL-4, IL-13, IL-4R&#x003b1; or STAT-6 might help better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in driving Th2 responses in BALB/c mice infected with ECTV. The adoptive transfer of such transgenic cells into recipient mice combined with the use of recombinant ECTV encoding the model antigen for infection is an approach that we propose to undertake.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have established that deficiency in specific factors associated with Th2 response development and/or the absence of vIFN-&#x003b3;-bp during infection of BALB/c mice with ECTV does not bias development of a Th1 response. IL-4, STAT-6 and IL-13, which are normally associated with development of Th2 responses, play important and non-redundant roles in the generation of optimal antiviral CTL responses. Our data also established that the absence of IL-13 and STAT-6 further increased the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to ECTV infection. We conclude that host resistance or susceptibility to mousepox is far more complex and goes beyond the presence or absence of select genetic factors that control Th differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0118685.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Representative flow cytometry profiles of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+</sup> 8 T cells from ECTV-WT infected mice.</title><p>Data are from one of the three separate experiments showing intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; expression (Y-axis) by splenic 8 T cells (X-axis) from WT and GKO mice.
