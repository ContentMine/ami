      <p>Prokaryotic and ciliate communities of healthy and aquarium White Syndrome (WS)-affected
         coral fragments were screened using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE).
         A significant difference (R = 0.907, p &lt; 0.001) in 16S rRNA prokaryotic diversity
         was found between healthy (H), sloughed tissue (ST), WS-affected (WSU) and antibiotic
         treated (WST) samples. Although 3 
         <i>Vibrio</i> spp were found in WS-affected samples, two of these species were eliminated following
         ampicillin treatment, yet lesions continued to advance, suggesting they play a minor
         or secondary role in the pathogenesis. The third 
         <i>Vibrio</i> sp increased slightly in relative abundance in diseased samples and was abundant
         in non-diseased samples. Interestingly, a 
         <i>Tenacibaculum</i> sp showed the greatest increase in relative abundance between healthy and WS-affected
         samples, demonstrating consistently high abundance across all WS-affected and treated
         samples, suggesting 
         <i>Tenacibaculum</i> sp could be a more likely candidate for pathogenesis in this instance. In contrast
         to previous studies bacterial abundance did not vary significantly (ANOVA, F2, 6 =
         1.000, p = 0.422) between H, ST, WSU or WST. Antimicrobial activity (assessed on 
         <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> cultures) was limited in both H and WSU samples (8.1% ±8.2 and 8.0% ±2.5, respectively)
         and did not differ significantly (Kruskal-Wallis, χ2 (2) = 3.842, p = 0.146). A 
         <i>Philaster</i> sp, a 
         <i>Cohnilembus</i> sp and a 
         <i>Pseudokeronopsis</i> sp. were present in all WS-affected samples, but not in healthy samples. The exact
         role of ciliates in WS is yet to be determined, but it is proposed that they are at
         least responsible for the neat lesion boundary observed in the disease.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Progressively more diseases of scleractinian corals are being reported in the scientific
         literature year on year [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref001">1</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref006">6</span>]. Despite this, the causal agents of these diseases are often in dispute, with a
         single accepted pathogen for a given disease being rare [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref007">7</span>]. This is the case for White Syndrome (WS), a disease commonly found in the Indo-Pacific
         and within aquarium systems [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref008">8</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref012">12</span>]. WS is characterized by tissue loss and acute lesion progression with a distinct
         boundary or band between apparently healthy tissue and exposed skeleton [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref013">13</span>].
      </p>
      <p>In the past, WS has been attributed to various species from the gammaproteobacteria
         genus 
         <i>Vibrio</i>, including; 
         <i>V</i>. 
         <i>harveyi</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref014">14</span>], 
         <i>V</i>. 
         <i>mediterranei</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref007">7</span>], 
         <i>V</i>. 
         <i>owensii</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref015">15</span>] and 
         <i>V</i>. 
         <i>coralliilyticus</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref010">10</span>]. Furthermore, Piskorska, Smith [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref007">7</span>], reports an increase in 
         <i>V</i>. 
         <i>mediterranei</i> in the mucus of WS-affected 
         <i>Echinopora lamellosa</i>, compared to healthy samples. However, Piskorska, Smith [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref007">7</span>] used a culture-based method in determining bacteria associated with healthy and
         WS-affected 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i>, an approach that can lead to phylum and class biases and result in inadequate profiling
         of microbial communities when not backed up with culture-independent techniques [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref016">16</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref017">17</span>], thus further work is required to confirm the role of 
         <i>Vibrio</i> species in this disease.
      </p>
      <p>Another proposed causal agent of WS includes 
         <i>Arcobacter</i> sp, found by Sweet and Bythell [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref018">18</span>] to be the only bacteria to be absent in non-diseased samples, appear in apparently
         healthy samples and increase to have a dominant presence in diseased 
         <i>A</i>. 
         <i>muricata</i> samples in a study screening the microbial communities associated with WS in this
         coral. Sweet and Bythell [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref018">18</span>] also found 
         <i>V</i>. 
         <i>harveyi</i> to increase in diseased samples, but also to be present in healthy samples. This
         presence in healthy samples does not rule out 
         <i>V</i>. 
         <i>harveyi</i> as a primary causal agent in WS, as Sussman, Mieog [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref019">19</span>] demonstrated that the zinc-metalloprotease (produced by pathogenic 
         <i>Vibrio</i> sp) responsible for the breakdown of coral tissue and photo-inactivation of zooxanthellae
         is only expressed once 
         <i>Vibrio</i> sp cell density exceeds 1x10
         <sup>9</sup> cells ml
         <sup>-1</sup>. This indicates that 
         <i>Vibrio</i> may not be harmful in lower densities, only becoming pathogenic as their numbers
         increase, explaining their presence in healthy samples and increase in diseased samples
         in the WS study by Sweet and Bythell [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref018">18</span>].
      </p>
      <p>The bacterial community associated with the holobiont of healthy corals is considered
         to play a potential role in sustaining coral health [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref020">20</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref024">24</span>]. This community is known to shift in stressed corals, lowering coral defence and
         impeding important processes, such as the cycling of nitrogen and sulphur. Actinobacteria,
         for example, are known for their production of secondary metabolites which can be
         lethal to invasive bacteria [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref025">25</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref027">27</span>]. Actinobacteria are also associated with healthy coral and have been found to decline
         in the event of environmental stress [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref028">28</span>] and disease [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref007">7</span>]. A shift in the natural microbial community associated with corals and a decline
         in actinobacteria could account for the proliferation of bacteria such as 
         <i>Vibrio</i> sp, which would then become pathogenic in larger cell quantities [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref019">19</span>] once their populations can no longer be controlled within the holobiont.
      </p>
      <p>Only relatively recently have other microorganisms been studied with their relation
         to coral diseases. For example ciliates such as two scuticociliates from the genus
         
         <i>Philaster</i> have been isolated from WS-affected specimens of 
         <i>Acropora muricata</i> and shown to be able to ingest the corals 
         <i>Symbiodinium</i> and actively burrow into and underneath apparently healthy tissue in advance of the
         disease lesion [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref018">18</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref029">29</span>]. However, what hasn’t been proved to date is the exact role of these ciliates in
         coral disease and how many diseases suffer from ciliate infestations. Particularly,
         are the ciliates primary pathogens in WS and involved in the breakdown of host tissue,
         or alternatively are they secondary pathogens consuming dead and dying tissues. Additionally,
         the study by Piskorska et al. [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref007">7</span>] did not investigate any potential ciliate community associated with WS in 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> and their roles in disease aetiology, as claimed necessary by Harvell, Jordán-Dahlgren
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref030">30</span>].
      </p>
      <p>This study aimed to determine the bacterial and ciliate communities associated with
         healthy and WS-affected 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> in aquaria, using culture-independent (16S rRNA gene) techniques. Additionally, the
         effect of experimental ampicillin treatment on the bacterial and ciliate communities
         of WS-affected 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> was analysed to determine the efficiency of antibiotic application in aquarium based
         corals and to infer whether certain bacteria are causal agents depending on their
         elimination from the bacterial community of treated samples.

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <div id="sec003">
         <h3>Experimental Procedure</h3>
         <p>All coral samples used in this work were kindly donated by the Horniman Museum and
            Gardens Aquarium with permission of the senior curator for the aquarium, Jamie Craggs.
         </p>
         <p>Both healthy and White Syndrome-affected 
            <i>Echinopora lamellosa</i> fragments (donated by the Horniman Museum and Gardens Aquarium, London, UK) were
            placed into an aquarium tank system (26°C, 34 ppt salinity) at Newcastle University.
            Samples were characterised as apparently healthy (n = 3), untreated WS (n = 3) and
            treated WS (25 μg/ml ampicillin) (n = 3). Each sample type was placed into independent
            tanks to prevent contamination between different sample types during acclimatisation
            and thus prevent the spread of WS to healthy frags. Fragments were given 24 hours
            to acclimatise following transportation and disease progression was monitored regularly
            to ensure lesions were advancing in WS specimens before continuing with the study.
            Following acclimatisation, fragments were placed into their own independent tanks.
            These tanks were smaller in size and thus required much greater monitoring of water
            salinity and temperature. Since smaller tanks were not hooked up to the main inflow/outflow
            system, tank water was replaced daily with sterile salt water that had been passed
            through a 0.22μm filter using a sterile syringe. Ampicillin treatment was administered
            (every 4 hours) to n = 3 fragments with the aim of determining the causal agent/s
            of WS in 
            <i>Echinopora lamellosa</i> through a process of elimination. Prokaryotic species present in untreated samples
            that were eliminated in treated samples (despite WS persisting in treated samples)
            would be unlikely to be causal agents of the disease.
         </p>
         <p>Three samples exhibiting what appeared to be a lesion similar to that associated with
            WS were sampled immediately upon arrival at Newcastle University. These were characterized
            as “sloughed tissue” (ST) samples.
         </p>
         <p>Samples were collected prior to complete tissue loss occurring in the WS-affected
            samples for microbial community analysis (stored in 100% ethanol at 4°C).

      </div>
      <div id="sec004">
         <h3>DNA Extraction</h3>
         <p>To determine microbial community shifts in healthy (H), sloughed tissue (ST) untreated
            WS-affected (WSU) and treated WS-affected (WST) 
            <i>E</i>. 
            <i>lamellosa</i> samples, n = 3 H, n = 3 ST, n = 3 WSU, and n = 3 WST were analysed. Upon sampling,
            coral fragments were stored in 50 ml falcon tubes filled with 100% Ethanol and kept
            at 4°C until fragments were individually crushed using a sterilised pestle and mortar.
            DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit and resultant extracted
            DNA stored at 4°C.

         <h3>Prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene diversity</h3>
         <p>Using the universal prokaryotic primers, as used by Sweet et al, 2010; (357F) (5’-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3’)
            and (518R) (5’ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3’), a segment of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was
            amplified using a Hybaid PCR Express thermal cycler, prior to DGGE analysis. PCR cycles
            were carried out at 94°C for 30 seconds, 53°C for 30 seconds and 72°C for 1 minute
            and a total of 30 cycles were performed, as well as a final extension step at 72°C
            for 10 minutes (Sweet et al, 2010). PCR reaction mixtures were made up to 10 μl, using;
            2 ng extracted DNA, buffer incubation mix with 1.5 mM MgCl
            <div tagx="sub">2</div> (MP Biomedicals), 0.2 mM dNTP (Qiagen), 0.5 mM primer 357F, 0.5 mM primer 518R, 2.5
            U of DreamTaq proof-reading DNA Polymerase (Fermentas). Each PCR sample mixture was
            done in triplicate and resulting PCR products combined to bring about a final volume
            of 30 μl for each sample. PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis
            [1% (w/v) agarose] with ethidium bromide staining and visualised using a UV transilluminator.
         </p>
         <p>DGGE was performed using the D-code universal mutation detection system (Bio-Rad).
            PCR products were resolved on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels using a 30 to 60% denaturant
            gradient for 16 hours at 60°C, with a constant voltage of 50 V. Following DGGE, gels
            were stained by pouring over a combined solution of 9 μl SYBR Gold (Sigma-Aldrich)
            and 50 μl 1xTAE buffer, and then left covered in the dark for 20 min. Gels were then
            washed in 500 ml 1xTAE buffer for 30 min and visualised using a UV transilluminator.
            To identify bands of most interest in the DGGE gels (those that represented the greatest
            differences/similarities between samples), representative bands were excised from
            the gel, left overnight in Sigma molecular grade water and then re-amplified using
            primers 357F and 518R. The products of each re-amplified band were then verified by
            agarose gel electrophoresis [1% (w/v) agarose] with ethidium bromide staining and
            visualised using a UV transilluminator. PCR products were then purified using the
            QIAGEN PCR Purification Kit (see main 
            <span ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">methods</span> section for complete description) and then labelled using a Big Dye (Applied Biosystems)
            transformation sequence kit and sent to Genevision (University of Newcastle) for sequencing.
            Sequences were then compared with sequences in the BLAST nucleotide database (NCBI)
            to allow for genus/species matching.
         </p>
         <p>Using Bionumerics 3.5 (Applied Maths BVBA) software, bacterial operation taxonomic
            units (OTUs) were defined from DGGE band-matching analysis. Standard internal marker
            lanes were used to allow for gel-to-gel comparisons. Tolerance and optimisation for
            band-matching was set at 1%.

            DNA Polymerase (Fermentas). PCR was carried out using a Hybaid PCR Express thermal
            cycler. PCR amplification was carried out using an un-nested approach [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref032">32</span>], with primary denaturation being carried out at 94°C for 5 min, followed by 26 PCR
            cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min. A final elongation step
            at 72°C was then carried out for 10 min to reduce heteroduplexes in the DGGE [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref033">33</span>]. Each PCR reaction was carried out in triplicate and the resulting PCR products
            combined to bring about a final volume of 30 μl for each sample. PCR products were
            verified by agarose gel electrophoresis [1% (w/v) agarose] with ethidium bromide staining
            and visualised using a UV transilluminator. DGGE was performed using the D-code universal
            mutation detection system (Bio-Rad). PCR products were resolved on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide
            gels possessing a 32 to 42% denaturant gradient for 16 hours at 60°C, with a constant
            voltage of 50V. Gels were stained and DGGE bands excised and purified as above, but
            using the ciliate primers. Samples were sent to Genevision (Newcastle University)
            for sequencing. DGGEs and samples were analysed as above. Retrieved ciliate nucleotide

            then dehydrated in a vacuum centrifuge to remove any ethanol in which the coral fragments
            were stored. Each eppendorf was then reweighed to determine the dry weight of tissue
            and 100% ethanol added to make all samples reach a standard concentration of 100 mg/ml,
            to be used as a stock solution in testing bacterial inhibition by coral extracts.

         <p>Pure cultures of

            culture to be used in each assay. The concentration of bacterial culture to be used
            in each assay was then standardised to 0.15 optical density (OD) units by diluting
            the primary stock with additional sterile LB broth accordingly.

         <p>The kinetics of bacterial growth was determined by reading the OD every 5 minutes
            over a 24 hour period in a Biotek Power Wave HT plate reader. The rate of bacterial
            growth during exponential phase was estimated by plotting OD against time to determine
            the gradient of each curve in a linear regression. Inhibition was then estimated by
            dividing the mean gradient of each sample type over the mean gradient of the ethanol
            controls. This was then calculated as % inhibition of bacterial growth when compared

            samples, but found to be absent in healthy tissues thus their grouping as WS-associated

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>This study is the first to simultaneously investigate the bacterial, archaeal and
         ciliate diversity of healthy and White Syndrome (WS)-affected samples of the scleractinian
         coral 
         <i>Echinopora lamellosa</i>, whilst also determining WS-associated microbial diversity shifts in response to
         antibiotic treatment (using the antibiotic ampicillin). The bacterial and archaeal
         (16S rRNA) diversity associated with 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> was found to increase between healthy and WS-affected samples, indicating that various
         species will opportunistically enter the holobiont [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref041">41</span>] or newly exposed niches (such as the coral skeleton) when a coral is diseased [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref018">18</span>]. Only two bacterial ribotypes were found to increase considerably in 16S rRNA gene
         DGGE profiles between all healthy and WS-affected samples and maintain this DGGE band
         density in ampicillin-treated samples: a sequence related to a 
         <i>Tenacibaculum</i> species and one related to a 
         <i>Phaeobacter</i> species (with the former being represented by a weak DGGE band in healthy samples
         and the latter being absent in healthy samples). 
         <i>Tenacibaculum maritimum</i> has previously been shown to be associated with a variety of different organisms
         in the marine environement, specifically associated with mucus layers such as in fish
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref042">42</span>] and the soft coral 
         <i>Dendronephthya</i> sp, in which the bacterium has been shown to produce a biofilm on the coral surface
         [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref043">43</span>]. 
         <i>T</i>. 
         <i>maritimum</i> has also been shown to be responsible for an ulcerative disease known as tenacibaculosis,
         which affects the body surface of fish, resulting in the formation of ulcers, lesions
         and tissue necrosis on their surfaces [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref042">42</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref044">44</span>]. Given the pathogenicity of members of this genus, it is possible that the bacterium
         detected in this study (which increased dramatically in WS samples) is carrying out
         a similar role. Furthermore, this genus has previously been found to increase in potentially
         stressed and tumour-affected soft tissue in 
         <i>Echinopora lamellosa</i>, which often subsequently became affected by WS [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref045">45</span>], as well as having recently been associated with WS in 
         <i>Acropora cervicornis</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref046">46</span>]. Interestingly, the ribotype related to 
         <i>Phaeobacter</i> spp has in contrast, previously been found to provide protection to certain hosts
         (specifically fish and mollusc larvae) against pathogenic bacteria such as common
         coral associated bacteria such as the 
         <i>Vibrio</i> spp. They do this by production of the antagonistic compound tropodithietic acid
         (TDA) [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref047">47</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref050">50</span>]. Furthermore, 
         <i>Phaeobacter</i> sp. has also previously been found in associated with 
         <i>Oculina patagonica</i>, from which isolates showed antimicrobial action against the coral pathogens 
         <i>Vibrio shiloi</i>, 
         <i>V</i>. 
         <i>coralliilyticus</i> and 
         <i>Thalassomonas loyana</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref022">22</span>]. It could therefore be expected that 
         <i>Phaeobacter</i> spp should aid in coral defence, the increase of this ribotype in WS samples could
         be an immune response initiated by the coral or the bacteria itself.
      </p>
      <p>Several species of 
         <i>Vibrio</i> [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref007">7</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref010">10</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref014">14</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref015">15</span>] and an 
         <i>Arcobacter</i> sp [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref018">18</span>] have been proposed as causal agents for WS, with species from both of these genera
         being identified in WS samples in this study. Sussman, Mieog [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref019">19</span>] have previously demonstrated that 
         <i>Vibrio</i> spp require a population of 1x10
         <sup>9</sup> in order for proteases involved in virulence to be produced, thus if a 
         <i>Vibrio</i> sp is the cause of WS in this study, complete dominance across all disease and treated
         samples would be expected, as stated by Sweet, Craggs [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref029">29</span>]. No 
         <i>Vibrio</i> sp were found in healthy samples, with all species being associated with WS-affected
         samples. Only one of these species, however, was found to be present in 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> samples treated with the antibiotic ampicillin (yet it was only detected in two out
         of three WST samples). Four of the seven 
         <i>Arcobacter</i> sp found in this study were associated with healthy samples in relatively high abundance,
         with only one of these species increasing considerably in diseased samples (yet one
         
         <i>Arcobacter</i> sp also declined in response to the onset of WS). The other three identified 
         <i>Arcobacter</i> sp. were found to exist inconsistently in WS-affected samples or in limited abundance.
         Using a process of elimination, the results of this study suggest that 
         <i>Vibrio</i> sp and 
         <i>Arcobacter</i> sp are not the causal agent for WS. An alternative view point may be that they are
         the causal agent for some WS outbreaks but not others, with WS being a polymicrobial
         disease caused by any opportunistic pathogenic bacteria at any given time. If the
         latter is true, then this leads to two possible scenarios for WS: a) WS is not a single
         disease, but rather different diseases that appear morphologically similar, or b)
         WS is the result of a systemic infection which can be caused by various pathogenic
         bacteria [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref029">29</span>].
      </p>
      <p>Over recent years, members of the coral holobiont have been found to provide particular
         services to their host, carrying out functions necessary for maintaining coral health,
         such as the cycling of nitrogen and sulphur and the production of secondary metabolites
         with an antimicrobial action useful against invasive bacteria [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref020">20</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref024">24</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref051">51</span>]. Based on the potential importance of various holobiont members, the loss of particular
         bacteria or archaea could have an impact on coral health. Three species identified
         in this study (closely related to a 
         <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> sp., a 
         <i>Rubrimonas</i> sp. and a 
         <i>Sulfolobus</i> sp.) were found to decline considerably between healthy samples and WS-affected samples,
         with their populations failing to recover to healthy levels in response to treatment
         (with the prokaryote closely related to 
         <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> sp. being completely lost). 
         <i>Sulfolobus</i> spp. are known to be sulphur oxidisers [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref052">52</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref053">53</span>], converting sulphur (S
         <div tagx="sub">8</div>) into sulphate (SO
         <div tagx="sub">4</div>
         <sup>2−</sup>), thus a depletion of 
         <i>Sulfolobus</i> spp. within the local microenvironment could result in an increase in sulphur and
         a decline in sulphate, provided there aren’t other members of the holobiont that can
         persist and carry out this function. An increase in sulphur ions can result in tissue
         necrosis in corals, as associated with Black Band Disease [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref054">54</span>] and sulphate reduction could result in reduced DMSP output by zooxanthellae, a molecule
         which Raina, Tapiolas [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref055">55</span>] state could have a significant role in antioxidant and antimicrobial production,
         osmoprotection and the shaping of the microbial community within the holobiont. 
         <i>Bradyrhizobium</i> spp are denitrifying bacteria known to completely denitrify nitrates to nitrites
         to nitrogen gas, thus a reduction in this species could impact on the cycling of nitrogen
         within the microenvironment, resulting in a more nitrogen-limited environment. Nitrogen-limitation
         has been found to directly impact zooxanthellae, resulting in a decline in growth
         and population density [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref056">56</span>].
      </p>
      <p>Bacterial abundance did not differ significantly, implying that in this particular
         case, WS is not the result of a general increase in bacterial load. This is in contrast
         to previous studies such as Luna, Biavasco [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref057">57</span>] and Sweet, Craggs [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref029">29</span>] whereby bacterial abundance was found to increase in other aquarium corals exhibiting
         WS. Since treatment with ampicillin impacted bacterial diversity, yet overall bacterial
         abundance was not found to decrease in treated samples, it is possible that there
         was a very rapid colonisation by bacteria once the coral was replaced back into the
         tank system. However, Sweet, Croquer [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref037">37</span>] showed that bacterial populations took &gt;12 hours to recover under field conditions
         following treatment of healthy corals with Ciprofloxacin, which suggests that such
         rapid recolonisation is unlikely. The Coral Probiotic theory [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref021">21</span>] proposes that the natural coral holobiont is host to microorganisms that aid in
         coral health and defence against invading bacteria via the production of secondary
         metabolites. This defence may be lost during an episode of environmental stress or
         disease due to a re-shuffling of the microbial community [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref021">21</span>] or in this instance disease and subsequent treatment. Interestingly, however, healthy
         and WS-affected coral samples in the present study were found to have very little
         to no impact on the growth of the reported coral pathogen (more specifically, previously
         proposed WS pathogen) 
         <i>Vibrio harveyi</i>. This could suggest that antimicrobial capacity is unchanged in healthy and diseased
         specimens, with 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> appearing to have a naturally very limited antimicrobial capacity against 
         <i>Vibrio harveyi</i>. This could suggest that not all corals, such as 
         <i>Echinopora lamellosa</i>, possess such antimicrobial qualities, perhaps relying more on the physical defences
         of the mucus barrier. It is also possible that these corals are more susceptible to
         certain stresses and diseases, as observed across a range of corals in response to
         climate change with certain species found to be more susceptible than others [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref058">58</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref059">59</span>]. However, it could also be argued that the findings of this study support research
         that demonstrates different coral species have different antimicrobial selectivity.
         Selectivity is a hallmark of antimicrobial activity in many coral species [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref060">60</span>–
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref062">62</span>] and it is possible that 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> features antimicrobial properties that do not select against 
         <i>Vibrio harveyi</i>. To understand the overall antimicrobial capacity and selectivity of 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> (and other species), future antimicrobial assays using coral extracts should be carried
         out against a much broader range of target prokaryotes.
      </p>
      <p>In the present study, all WS-affected samples (treated and untreated) were found to
         be host to a number of ciliate species, whilst no ciliates were identified in healthy
         
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> samples, thus making this the first study to identify and directly associate ciliates
         with WS in the plating coral 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i>. A 
         <i>Philaster</i> sp was also found to be present in all diseased samples in the present study, supporting
         previous studies associating this particular genus with the consumption of the corals
         
         <i>Symbiodinium</i> in WS, White Band Disease (WBD) and Brown Band Disease (BBD)[
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref018">18</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref029">29</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref063">63</span>]. The belief that this ciliate is responsible for the neat lesion edge associated
         with WS is supported by research into the role of another 
         <i>Philaster</i> sp (
         <i>P</i>. 
         <i>lucinda</i>) in WBD and WS [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref046">46</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref063">63</span>]. It was observed that when the ciliate was knocked down using metronidazole in WBD
         and WS samples, the morphology of lesion interface was altered, yet lesion progression
         continued. This promotes the theory that 
         <i>P</i>. 
         <i>lucinda</i> is a secondary agent in WBD, which could also be the case for 
         <i>Philaster</i> species associated with WS. Other predominant ciliates found in the present study
         were 
         <i>Cohnilembus</i> sp. and 
         <i>Pseudokeronopsis</i> sp. There are no previous reports linking 
         <i>Cohnilembus</i> sp. with corals and disease, despite this ciliate being found in all WS-affected
         
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i> samples in the present study. 
         <i>Cohnilembus</i> sp. is known to exist as a bacterivorous benthic suspension feeder which has enhanced
         feeding when attached to a surface, whereby stronger feeding currents can be created
         compared to when the ciliate is suspended in the water column [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref064">64</span>]. It is possible therefore that during WS, 
         <i>Cohnilembus</i> sp. attaches to areas of denuded skeleton that can no longer be protected by the
         host coral. A further ciliate species identified in this study, 
         <i>Pseudokeronopsis</i> sp. was also found in WS and BBD samples by Sweet and Bythell [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref018">18</span>], they observed this particular ciliate to be a ciliaphore, consuming other protists
         and predominantly found in areas of denuded skeleton. This indicates 
         <i>Pseudokeronopsis</i> sp. does not have a role in WS pathology, but rather exists as part of a ciliate
         food chain colonising the exposed skeleton following the removal of tissue due to
         the disease. It remains uncertain whether the association of ciliates with WS is cause
         or effect, but it appears very clear that ciliates play an important role in the aetiology
         of WS lesions [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref029">29</span>]. Interestingly, 
         <i>Mesanophrys</i> spp., ciliates belonging to the order 
         <i>Philasterida</i>, and morphologically similar to 
         <i>Philaster</i>, have previously been associated with tissue degradation in different organisms,
         such as crabs [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref065">65</span>, 
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref066">66</span>], lobsters [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref067">67</span>] and fish (such as the turbot) [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref068">68</span>]. Small, Neil [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref067">67</span>] found that a 
         <i>Mesanophrys</i> sp. isolated from infected lobsters express metalloproteases capable of proteolysis
         of several host proteins, including structural proteins such as myosin. We propose
         that future studies on coral disease should aim to determine the expression of similar
         proteases in coral disease-associated ciliates in order to determine if they are capable
         of direct host tissue stress and degradation, thus further clarifying their role in
         diseases such WS.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, this study has determined shifts in the microbial rRNA gene profiles
         between healthy and WS-affected 
         <i>E</i>. 
         <i>lamellosa</i>. Given its association with the formation of lesions and ulceration, as well as tissue
         necrosis in various fish species, and based on its strong association with WS-affected
         samples in the present study, the bacterium 
         <i>Tenacibaculum</i> sp. is presented as a novel potential causal agent for lesion formation and tissue
         necrosis in 
         <i>Echinopora lamellosa</i>. Since this bacterium has not been reported as a causal agent for WS in the past,
         this supports the view that there is no specific causal agent for this disease, but
         rather various opportunistic necrotizing bacteria capable of tissue breakdown may
         have the capacity for initiating WS [
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0121780.ref029">29</span>], thus the disease is likely polymicrobial. However, future studies focusing on fulfilling
         Koch’s postulates with regards to the role of 
         <i>Tenacibaculum</i> sp in WS are required. This study further supports recent work showing that ciliates
         play an active role in disease morphology in many different species of coral, giving
         the disease its characterizing neat boundary at the lesion interface between healthy
         tissue and denuded skeleton. Future work should focus on the isolation of proteases
         and other molecules involved in tissue stress and degradation from associated ciliate
         isolates (particularly zooxanthellae consumers), thus determining whether or not they
         actively impair and break down healthy host tissue or whether they are passively feeding
         on already weakened tissue. Additionally, this study appears to demonstrate that not
         all corals possess probiotic qualities that aid in their defence against invasive
         microorgansims, which could contribute to why some corals are more susceptible to
         stress and disease than others.
