RECOMMENDATIONS
Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline 
denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the ‘strength’ of the recommendation).
The ‘strength’ of a recommendation takes into account the quality (level) of the evidence. Although higher-quality evidence is more 
likely to be associated with strong recommendations than lower-quality evidence, a particular level of quality does not automatically 
lead to a particular strength of recommendation.
Other factors that are taken into account when forming recommendations include: relevance to the NHS in Scotland; applicability 
of published evidence to the target population; consistency of the body of evidence, and the balance of benefits and harms of the 
options.
R For ‘strong’ recommendations on interventions that ‘should’ be used, the guideline development group is confident that, for the vast majority of people, the intervention (or interventions) will do more good than harm.
For ‘conditional’ recommendations on interventions that should be ‘considered’, the guideline development group is confident 
R that the intervention will do more good than harm for most patients. The choice of intervention is therefore more likely to vary depending on a person’s values and preferences, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time discussing the 
options with the patient.

Glaucoma referral and safe discharge 1 •  Introduction 
1 Introduction
1.1 THE NEED foR A GuIDElINE
Glaucoma is an eye disease characterised by a progressive optic neuropathy and associated visual field loss 
(VFL). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.1  In the UK glaucoma is the second 
most common cause of visual impairment.2 
Glaucoma can be classified anatomically according to the width of the anterior chamber angle in the eye, 
and is either a primary condition or secondary to another systemic or ocular condition.3
The incidence of glaucoma in the UK increases with age and glaucoma accounts for up to 20% of referrals to 
secondary-eye-care services, the vast majority of which come via community optometrists. Since glaucoma 
is associated with advancing age, the number of patients requiring management of the condition is rising 
as life expectancy increases.4
Early identification and referral of patients with ophthalmic pathology, and prompt secondary-care response 
facilitates timely management with the aim of limiting visual disability.3, 5, 6 
In one study in England around a third of referrals from optometrists without special interest in glaucoma 
resulted in discharge at first visit.4 The Scottish General Ophthalmic Services (GOS) arrangements are unique 
to Scotland and were implemented in 2006 to facilitate  identification of ophthalmic pathology at the earliest 
opportunity.7 The arrangements can be found in Annex 1. The accuracy of the referral of patients with 
suspected glaucoma from the community to secondary-eye-care services has improved since introduction 
of the GOS although there are continuing issues around variation in practice.8 
The current Scottish GOS arrangements offer a consistently wider range of clinical tests than are available 
elsewhere in the UK. They mandate glaucoma-detection strategies but do not incorporate guidance on which 
patient groups require referral from primary to secondary care, and this may result in variation in referral 
practice. Additionally, there is currently no guidance on which patient groups can be safely monitored in the 
community or discharged from secondary to primary care taking into account the existing clinical support 
services within the Scottish GOS arrangements.
1.2 REMIT of THE GuIDElINE
1.2.1 OVERALL OBjECTIVES
This guideline provides recommendations based on current evidence for best practice in the primary-care 
assessment and referral of patients with suspected glaucoma of any subtype, from the community into 
secondary-eye-care services and the safe discharge of patients from secondary-eye-care services back into 
the community.
Recommendations are provided on the investigations required, the frequency of examinations and 
communication and notification of all the healthcare providers involved in the patient pathway.
The guideline also makes recommendations on identifying which patients can be safely followed up in the 
community maximising the potential of the existing GOS arrangements and the electronic interface between 
community optometry and NHS health boards through the Eyecare Integration Project.9
The key questions on which the guideline is based can be found in Annex 2.
The guideline excludes treatment of ocular hypertension (OHT) and glaucoma which is covered by 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Clinical Guideline (CG) 85 Glaucoma: diagnosis and 
management of chronic open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.10

1.2.2 TARGET USERS OF THE GUIDELINE
This guideline will be of particular interest to community optometrists, general practitioners and hospital-
based healthcare professionals involved in glaucoma care, including ophthalmologists, optometrists, specialist 
nurses and orthoptists. It will also be of interest to patients and carers.
1.3 STATEMENT of INTENT
This guideline is not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are 
determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual case and are subject to change 
as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. Adherence to guideline 
recommendations will not ensure a successful outcome in every case, nor should they be construed as 
including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same 
results. The ultimate judgement must be made by the appropriate healthcare professional(s) responsible 
for clinical decisions regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan. This judgement should only 
be arrived at following discussion of the options with the patient, covering the diagnostic and treatment 
choices available. It is advised, however, that significant departures from the national guideline or any local 
guidelines derived from it should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant 
decision is taken.
1.3.1 PATIENT VERSION
A patient version of this guideline is available from the SIGN website, www.sign.ac.uk 
1.3.2 PRESCRIBING OF LICENSED MEDICINES OUTWITH THEIR MARKETING AUTHORISATION 
Recommendations within this guideline are based on the best clinical evidence. Some recommendations 
may be for medicines prescribed outwith the marketing authorisation (MA) also known as product licence. 
This is known as ‘off label’ use.
Medicines may be prescribed off label in the following circumstances:
y for an indication not specified within the marketing authorisation
y for administration via a different route
y for administration of a different dose
y for a different patient population.
An unlicensed medicine is a medicine which does not have MA for medicinal use in humans. 
Generally ‘off label’ prescribing of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed 
medicines within the marketing authorisation. Such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and 
experience.11
“Prescribing medicines outside the conditions of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) 
the prescribers’ professional responsibility and potential liability.”11
The General Medical Council (GMC) recommends that when prescribing a medicine ‘off label’, doctors should:
y  be satisfied that such use would better serve the patient’s needs than an authorised alternative (if one 
exists)
y  be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence/experience of using the medicine to show its safety and 
efficacy, seeking the necessary information from appropriate sources
y  record in the patient’s clinical notes the medicine prescribed and, when not following common practice, 
the reasons for the choice
y  take responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient’s care, including monitoring 
the effects of the medicine.

Glaucoma referral and safe discharge 1 •  Introduction 
Non-medical prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the legislative framework and their own 
professional prescribing standards.
Prior to any prescribing, the licensing status of a medication should be checked in the summary of product 
characteristics (www.medicines.org.uk). The prescriber must be competent, operate within the professional 
code of ethics of their statutory bodies and the prescribing practices of their employers.12
1.3.3 ADDITIONAL ADVICE TO NHSSCOTLAND FROM HEALTHCARE IMPROVEMENT SCOTLAND AND THE 
SCOTTISH MEDICINES CONSORTIUM
Healthcare Improvement Scotland processes multiple technology appraisals (MTAs) for NHSScotland that 
have been produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales.
The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) provides advice to NHS boards and their Area Drug and Therapeutics 
Committees about the status of all newly licensed medicines and any major new indications for established 
products.
No SMC advice relevant to this guideline was identified.

2 Key recommendations
The following recommendations and good-practice points were highlighted by the guideline development 
group as those that should be prioritised for implementation.
2.1 MEASuREMENT of INTRAoCulAR PRESSuRE
R  for patients with ocular hypertension or suspected glaucoma a reliable baseline measure of 
intraocular pressure is required. A minimum of two intraocular pressure readings on a single 
occasion using the same tonometer is recommended. The type of tonometer and the time of 
measurement should be specified in any referral to secondary-eye-care services.
2.2 oPTIC DISC ASSESSMENT
R  The narrowest rim/disc ratio and disc size should be recorded and considered alongside additional 
indicators of glaucoma, such as optic disc nerve fibre layer haemorrhage and cup/disc ratio 
asymmetry, when assessing the need for referral to secondary-eye-care services.
  Patients with the following optic disc parameters should be considered for referral to secondary-
eye-care services:
•  small discs (<1.5 mm • m edium discs (1.5–2.0 •  large discs (>2.0 mm 
in diameter) where the mm in diameter) where in diameter) where 
narrowest rim/disc ratio the narrowest rim/disc the narrowest rim/
is <0.3 ratio is <0.2 disc ratio is <0.1
 
 
	 	
	 	 These parameters correspond to Spaeth’s disc damage likelihood scale stage 4 or greater.  
2.3 vISuAl fIElD ASSESSMENT
 A minimum of two visual field tests with consistent findings is recommended before referral to 
secondary-eye-care services. One test may suffice if the result is unequivocal.

Glaucoma referral and safe discharge 2 • Key recommendations
2.4 CRITERIA foR REfERRAl To SECoNDARy-EyE-CARE SERvICES
 Irrespective of intraocular pressure, patients with one or more of the following findings should be 
referred to secondary-eye-care services:
y optic disc signs consistent with glaucoma in either eye
y a reproducible visual field defect consistent with glaucoma in either eye
y risk of angle closure (occludable angle)
-	  using Van Herick technique, if the peripheral anterior chamber width is one quarter or less of 
the corneal thickness
-	 using gonioscopy, if ≥270 degrees of posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork is not visible.
 Patients who have ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure >25 mm Hg may be considered for 
referral to secondary-eye-care services irrespective of central corneal thickness.
  Patients who have ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure <26 mm Hg and central corneal 
thickn ess <555 micrometers should be referred to secondary-eye-care services if they are aged ≤65.
  Patients who have ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure <26 mm Hg and central corneal 
thickness ≥555 micrometers may be monitored in the community. 
2.5 DISCHARGE fRoM SECoNDARy-EyE-CARE SERvICES
 When a patient is discharged from secondary-eye-care services the responsibility for patient care is 
transferred to the optometrist.
 Local arrangements for follow up and monitoring in the community should include protocols 
for communicating with patients who do not attend, or do not respond to invitations to make 
appointments, and for liaison with general practice and secondary-eye-care services. 
 The following groups may be considered for discharge from secondary-eye-care services where 
robust local arrangements are in place for follow up and monitoring in the community. Patients with:
y  untreated ocular hypertension where intraocular pressure is <26 mmHg, CCT is ≥555 micrometers 
and ocular examination is otherwise normal
y  untreated ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure >25 mm Hg with otherwise normal ocular 
examination and a low lifetime risk of glaucomatous visual disability
y  treated ocular hypertension where re-referral criteria are documented.
 Patients with primary angle closure who have had  prophylactic iridotomy may be considered for 
discharge from secondary-eye-care services if they:
y have confirmed open angle
y are not on topical medication
y have no evidence of glaucoma.
 Patients with treated glaucoma should normally be monitored in secondary-eye-care services
Discharge to a locally accredited glaucoma optometrist may be considered at the discretion of the 
consultant ophthalmologist where this is in the best interests of the patient. Robust local arrangements 
for follow up and monitoring should be in place and the frequency of monitoring and criteria for re-
referral should be individualised.

measurement of IoP and perimetry should be established. Repeat glaucoma testing every two 
years is recommended.

3.1 INTRoDuCTIoN
A detailed history including relevant medical, family and ocular history is undertaken as part of a primary 
eye examination.7
 When referring a patient with suspected glaucoma to secondary-eye-care services, the optometrist 
should highlight the presence of any glaucoma risk factors. 
3.2 DEMoGRAPHIC AND NoN-oCulAR RISK fACToRS
Meta-analyses of the epidemiology of glaucoma highlight the major demographic and non-ocular risk 
factors for open-angle glaucoma as increasing age (from age 40), black ethnicity, family history in a first-
++
degree relative, and comorbid diabetes, hypertension and peripheral vascular disease (see Table 1).1, 13 Key 2
demographic risk factors for angle-closure glaucoma identified in a meta-analysis include increasing age (from 
age 40),  female sex and eastern Asian ethnicity (see Table 2).14 Estimates vary owing to study inclusion criteria.

3.3 oCulAR RISK fACToRS
3.3.1 RAISED INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE
Ocular hypertension is defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) consistently greater than 21 mm Hg (in at least 
one eye) and the absence of clinical signs of glaucoma.15
The risk of developing glaucoma increases with increasing IOP.13 Having a raised IOP, outside the generally 
agreed population normal range (10–21 mm Hg) is considered to be the most important glaucoma risk factor, 2++
as it is the only one that can be treated. People with an IOP within the normal range can develop glaucoma. 
Multifactorial risk prediction models can be used to quantify the risk of disease.
For the most common type of glaucoma (primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), three models combining 
risk factors have been used to derive risk prediction equations for development of the disease.16 These 
are based on data from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS)17 and the European Glaucoma 
Prevention Study (EGPS).18 The OHTS/EGPS risk model is an equation for predicting the five-year risk of 2++
POAG in adult patients with ocular hypertension. All of the variables included in the model can be routinely 
collected in clinical practice: age; IOP; central corneal thickness (CCT); vertical cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio and 
pattern standard deviation (PSD). A simple calculator based on the model and freely available online enables 
estimation of the five-year risk of a patient with OHT developing POAG in at least one eye (http://ohts.wustl.
edu/risk/calculator.html).
The clinical utility of the tool is perceived to be limited as the C/D ratio is subjective and not easily 
quantified. Also, findings from participants included in research studies may not be generalisable to the 
general population. However, in an independent validation of this model in four independent cohorts, the 
++
discriminative ability, that is the ability of the equation to distinguish between individuals who developed 2
POAG in five years and those who did not, was good. In calibration analyses, however, the equation generally 
overestimated the observed risk of POAG.15 Based on these data, further research to update the tool to 
be more applicable for use in clinical care was recommended. The NICE guideline on glaucoma stratifies 
glaucoma risk based on age, IOP and CCT.10
3.3.2 MyOPIA
Myopia is an important risk factor for open-angle glaucoma. A meta-analysis of 11 cross-sectional studies 
found that individuals with myopia have around double the risk of glaucoma compared to individuals who 
2+ 
do not have myopia, odds ratio (OR) 1.92 (95% CI 1.54 to 2.38).19  In a meta-analysis, the OR for the presence 3
of glaucoma in high myopia (≥6 diopters) was 5.7 (95% CI 3.1 to 11). There is no linear association between 
the risk of glaucoma and degree of myopia.1, 19

4 Primary-care examination and assessment of patients 
with ocular hypertension or suspected glaucoma
4.1 GooD PRACTICE
 When referring a patient with suspected glaucoma to secondary-eye-care services the optometrist 
should indicate findings of tonometry, examination by slit-lamp biomicroscopy to include anterior 
segment and optic disc, and visual field assessment.
  Advanced pathology requires urgent referral, which should not be delayed in order to undertake 
repeat examinations.
  Offer patients the opportunity to discuss their diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, and provide them 
with relevant information in an accessible format at initial and subsequent visits.
4.2 MEASuREMENT of INTRAoCulAR PRESSuRE
A range of tonometers are used in clinical practice. Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) is the currently 
accepted reference-standard technique for measuring IOP.
No studies were identified comparing GAT with other technologies in terms of referral accuracy or diagnostic 
accuracy for features suggestive of glaucoma.
A meta-analysis of 99 studies comparing tonometers identified heterogeneity of effect which was, in part, 
attributed to variability in the reference standard. There was substantial IOP measurement variability for all 
tonometers including GAT, both within and between studies. Non-contact tonometers (NCT) (4 studies) and 2++
hand-held applanation tonometers (HAT) (26 studies) achieved the measurements closest to the GAT with 
around 59% and 66% within 2 mm Hg respectively and 79% and 85% of measurements within 3 mm Hg 
respectively.15
A Health Technology Assessment (HTA) examined the degree of within-patient variability in IOP measurement, 
using models based on untreated ocular hypertension, and suggested that measurement ‘noise’ of the 2++
order of 3 mm Hg could be reduced by taking the average of two or three measurements at a single visit. 
Measurement at similar times of day on repeat visits may reduce the impact of diurnal variation.15
An HTA did not identify any good quality evidence assessing the value of examining the degree of short- or 2++
long-term IOP fluctuation as a risk factor for the development or progression of glaucoma.22
An HTA did not identify any good quality evidence for the use of a diurnal tension curve (multiple IOP 
measurements over a minimum eight-hour period) in patients with suspected glaucoma who had single 2++
IOP measurements within the normal range.22
 R   for patients with ocular hypertension or suspected glaucoma a reliable baseline measure of 
intraocular pressure is required. A minimum of two intraocular pressure readings on a single 
occasion using the same tonometer is recommended. The type of tonometer and the time of 
measurement should be specified in any referral to secondary-eye-care services.
 To promote consistency between primary and secondary care, tonometry should be performed with 
Goldmann or Perkins type tonometers.
 Protocols should be in place for regularly checking calibration to ensure tonometer accuracy.

Glaucoma referral and safe discharge 4 • Primary-care examination and assessment of patients with ocular hypertension or suspected glaucoma
4.3 MEASuREMENT of CENTRAl CoRNEAl THICKNESS
No evidence was identified to show whether or not referral accuracy is improved when CCT measurements 
are provided in addition to IOP measurements in patients with ocular hypertension.
A high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis identified strong evidence, that in a multivariate model, 
2++
CCT is a risk factor for progression of ocular hypertension to POAG.15
A moderate-quality systematic review reported inconsistent findings about the relationship between CCT 
and glaucoma prevalence or glaucoma progression but identified consistent evidence that CCT is a risk 2+
factor for progression of ocular hypertension to glaucomatous optic neuropathy.23
An evidence-based guideline notes that CCT can act as a confounder of IOP measurement and is therefore of 
value in interpreting IOP measurements.10 There is, however, no verified algorithm to apply to the relationship 2++
between CCT and IOP.23
R  Central corneal thickness should be measured in patients with ocular hypertension or suspected 
glaucoma and reported alongside the measured intraocular pressure results when referring to 
secondary-eye-care services.
 Repeat measurements should be taken on a single occasion. This is an inherent feature of ultrasound 
pachymeters which provide a final reading based on an average of measurements. Mean and standard 
deviation should be recorded and provided in any referral.
 The type of pachymeter used should be stated on patient records and referrals.
4.4 ASSESSMENT of ANTERIoR CHAMBER ANGlE
Gonioscopy is the reference standard for assessment of the anterior chamber angle in patients with suspected 
glaucoma or OHT. It is not currently practised by all optometrists and requires experience to interpret the 
angle appearance. Gonioscopy is unsuitable for some patients particularly where there are anxiety or mobility 
difficulties.
No systematic reviews of studies comparing methods for anterior chamber angle assessment were identified.
All of the primary studies identified were carried out in entirely or predominantly non-Caucasian groups 
including Indian, Korean, Chinese and Malay populations, all of which have higher rates of angle closure 
than Caucasians. Studies were carried out in research settings, where the tests were conducted almost 
exclusively by glaucoma specialist ophthalmologists, and therefore the results may not be directly applicable 
to community optometrists.
Where the sensitivity and specificity for detection of narrow angles were reported in comparisons of optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) with gonioscopy, there was generally high sensitivity (84–100%) but low 
specificity (41–69%).24-33  There was variation in the scanning protocols used and issues around the ability of 2+
operators to identify the scleral spur as a reference point in the technique. Significant interobserver variability 3
was reported in the identification of angle closure by OCT. In one study the level of agreement between 
raters was described as poor to fair for Cirrus™ whilst for iVue® it was described as fair.32
OCT is an evolving technology in terms of assessment of anterior angle and is not currently available to all 
optometrists.
In one study comparing a Van Herick grading method with gonioscopy there was high sensitivity (84.9%) and 
high specificity (89.6%) for the identification of narrow angle.34 A second study reported 61.9% sensitivity and 
89.3% specificity.35 In studies reporting level of agreement one (n=148) reported good agreement between 2

Van Herick and gonioscopy for identification of narrow angles,29 whilst a smaller study in African patients 
(n=36) noted poor correlation between the methods.36

Glaucoma referral and safe discharge
R  Depending on practitioner’s preference and clinical competence, either the van Herick method 
or gonioscopy may be used to detect narrow anterior chamber angles in patients with ocular 
hypertension or suspected angle closure.
 Due to the low specificity of optical coherence tomography, referral to secondary-eye-care services 
should not be based on the results of anterior chamber OCT measurements alone.
4.5 oPTIC DISC ASSESSMENT
4.5.1 OPHTHALMOSCOPy
In a meta-analysis of five studies examining the accuracy of ophthalmoscopy for screening for open-angle 
glaucoma, the pooled sensitivity was 60% (95% credible interval (CrI) 34 to 82) and the pooled specificity 2++
was 94% (95% CrI 76 to 99).13
4.5.2 OPTIC DISC ASSESSMENT
A systematic review of the parameters of optic disc assessment reported that for a C/D ratio of ≥0.7 (four 
studies), the likelihood ratio (LR) for POAG was 14 (95% CI 5.3 to 39). For a C/D ratio asymmetry ≥0.3 (three 2+
studies) the LR was 7.3 (95% CI 3.3 to 16). The LR associated with the presence of disc haemorrhage (five 
studies) was 12 (95% CI 2.9 to 48).1
While the systematic reviews did not specifically address clinical assessment of optic disc size and morphology, 
evidence from primary research papers confirmed the importance of disc size measurement in the 
interpretation of the C/D ratio.37, 38 The size of the disc can be rapidly assessed during slit-lamp biomicroscopy 2+
and when this is combined with an assessment of the neuroretinal rim morphology, as in Spaeth’s disc damage 3
likelihood scale (DDLS, see Annex 3 ), it allows discrimination between glaucomatous and normal discs and 
compares favourably with Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II disc assessment.39-45
The clinical utility of the ISNT rule (inferior, superior, nasal and temporal) in the diagnosis of glaucomatous 3
neuropathy has been called into question by a number of studies.46-49
R  for patients with suspected glaucoma the optic discs should be examined by slit-lamp 
biomicroscopy. The vertical optic disc diameter should be measured using the slit beam height. 
This should be corrected for the magnification of the condensing lens, and the disc categorised 
as small, medium or large.
 For optic disc examination in patients with suspected glaucoma, the pupil should be dilated unless 
there is a high risk of angle-closure.
R  The narrowest rim/disc ratio and disc size should be recorded and considered alongside additional 
indicators of glaucoma, such as optic disc nerve fibre layer haemorrhage and cup/disc ratio 
asymmetry, when assessing the need for referral to secondary-eye-care services.
12 |
Glaucoma referral and safe discharge 4 • Primary-care examination and assessment of patients with ocular hypertension or suspected glaucoma
  Patients with the following optic disc parameters should be considered for referral to secondary-
eye-care services:
•  small discs (<1.5 mm •  medium discs (1.5–2.0 •  large discs (>2.0 mm 
in diameter) where the mm in diameter) where in diameter) where 
narrowest rim/disc ratio the narrowest rim/disc the narrowest rim/
is <0.3 ratio is <0.2 disc ratio is <0.1
 
 
	 	
These parameters correspond to Spaeth’s disc damage likelihood scale stage 4 or greater.  
 Referral should not be made solely on the basis of apparent violation of the ISNT rule.
   Patients with an optic disc nerve fibre layer haemorrhage should be referred irrespective of other 
signs of glaucoma.
4.5.3 OPTIC DISC PHOTOGRAPHy
In a meta-analysis of six studies examining the accuracy of optic disc photography for screening for open-
angle glaucoma the pooled sensitivity was 73% (95% CrI 61 to 83) and the pooled specificity was 89% (95% 2++
CrI 50 to 99).13  
R  The optic discs should be photographed and the images transmitted with the electronic referral 
letter. 
  Where available, use of stereophotography should be considered.
4.5.4 IMAGING DEVICES
In a meta-analysis of three studies examining the accuracy of the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II for 
screening for open-angle glaucoma the pooled sensitivity was 86% (CrI 55 to 97) and the pooled specificity 2++
was 89% (95% CrI  66 to 98). No studies of optical coherence tomography or scanning laser polarimetry (GDx 
instrument) for imaging of the nerve fibre layer met the inclusion criteria.13
A systematic review compared a range of imaging devices for assessment of the optic disc in diagnosis of 
glaucoma, including confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, OCT, and scanning laser polarimetry. Nearly 
++
all of the studies identified included patients with visual field loss and the review concluded that they did 2
not therefore evaluate the ability of such devices to detect disease in patients with suspected glaucoma. 
The review also concluded that no one device was superior to any other.50
There is insufficient evidence supporting additional clinical benefit of OCT or scanning laser polarimetry in 
the diagnosis of glaucoma to make any recommendation for the primary-care setting.

4.6 vISuAl fIElD ASSESSMENT
No systematic reviews were identified comparing visual field assessment technologies with the outcome of 
referral accuracy in patients suspected of having glaucoma.
A systematic review of studies published up to November 2005 exploring the accuracy of screening tests for 
open-angle glaucoma reported the sensitivities and specificities of frequency doubling technology (FDT), 
oculokinetic perimetry (OKP) and standard automated perimetry (SAP). Table 3 summarises the pooled 
sensitivity and specificity of the visual function tests (perimetry), combining all available studies. There were 2++
few good- quality studies for each test and the inclusion of SAP as part of the reference standard introduced 
potential bias in some cases. In a subgroup of the studies which assessed early/moderate stage glaucoma 
the sensitivity of OKP was 25% compared with 97% for SAP. Oculokinetic perimetry, although promising in 
a screening setting, may not be sufficiently sensitive for case detection in an optometric setting. Two studies 
in the review directly compared SAP with FDT C-20-5, with both reporting that FDT had superior sensitivity 
but poorer specificity than SAP.13, 51 
Table 3: Sensitivity and specificity of visual function tests for detection of open-angle glaucoma13, 51
Studies/high-quality Pooled sensitivity (%) Pooled specificity (%) 
studies (95%  CrI) (95% CrI)
FDT C-20-1 3/1 92 (65–99) 94 (73–99)
FDT C-20-5 5/2 78 (19–99) 75 (57–87)
OKP 4/1 86 (29–100) 90 (79–96)
SAP full threshold 5/2 88 (65–97) 80 (55–93)
SAP supra-threshold 9/1 71 (51–86) 85 (73–93)
A narrative review of the effectiveness of visual function tests in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with 
glaucoma was based on a systematic, but limited, literature search which identified 85 studies. The review 2+
concluded that algorithms, such as the Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm (SITA), have led to visual 
field tests which provide more reliable information than full-threshold SAP testing in this patient group.52
R  for patients with ocular hypertension or suspected glaucoma, standard automated perimetry is 
recommended for visual field testing. frequency doubling technology is also acceptable.
  A minimum of two visual field tests with consistent findings is recommended before referral to 
secondary-eye-care services. One test may suffice if the result is unequivocal.
 T he use of the same technology in the community and secondary-eye-care services has benefit in 
allowing direct comparisons to be made between the visual field plots.

5 Criteria for referral to secondary-eye-care services
No systematic reviews were identified exploring the clinical effectiveness of different referral criteria.
The following good-practice points for referral are based on the expertise of the SIGN guideline development 
group informed by the NICE guideline on the diagnosis and management of glaucoma,10 subsequent joint 
guidance from the College of Optometrists and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists,53 and an HTA on 
surveillance for ocular hypertension.15
Development of the criteria has taken account of the views of the eye-care community in Scotland expressed 
during open consultation and the expertise of invited peer reviewers from within and beyond Scotland.
 Irrespective of intraocular pressure, patients with one or more of the following findings should be 
referred to secondary-eye-care services:
y optic disc signs consistent with glaucoma in either eye
y a reproducible visual field defect consistent with glaucoma in either eye
y risk of angle closure (occludable angle)
-	  using Van Herick technique, if the peripheral anterior chamber width is one quarter or less of 
the corneal thickness
-	 using gonioscopy, if ≥270 degrees of posterior pigmented trabecular meshwork is not visible.
  Patients who have ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure >25 mm Hg may be considered for 
referral to secondary-eye-care services irrespective of central corneal thickness.
 Patients who have ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure <26 mm Hg and central corneal 
thickness <555 micrometers should be referred to secondary-eye-care services if they are aged ≤65.
  Patients who have ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure <26 mm Hg and central corneal

6 Discharge from secondary-eye-care services
6.1 fACIlITATING SAfE DISCHARGE
  When deciding if a patient should be discharged from secondary eye-care-services, there should be 
discussion with the patient to identify and take account of their preferences.  
  When a patient is discharged from secondary-eye-care services the responsibility for patient care is 
transferred to the optometrist.
 Local arrangements for follow up and monitoring in the community should include protocols 
for communicating with patients who do not attend, or do not respond to invitations to make 
appointments, and for liaison with general practice and secondary-eye-care services.
6.1.1 DISCHARGE LETTERS
 Discharge letters should include: patient age, diagnosis/condition, visual acuity, central corneal 
thickness, intraocular pressure, last visual field test, descriptor of optic nerve head, measurement 
of anterior chamber angle, current medication and information on allergies or adverse reactions to 
medication.
  Letters should include instructions on specific indications for re-referral to secondary-eye-care services, 
such as defined intraocular pressure and should include contact details for direct re-referral.
  Discharge letters should be addressed to a specified optometrist, which will normally be the referring 
optometrist, and copied to the patient and to their general practitioner.
A sample discharge letter adapted from NHS Grampian can be found in Annex 5.
6.1.2 PATIENT-HELD RECORD
No systematic reviews were identified on the effectiveness of providing a patient-held record to individuals 
diagnosed with or at risk of glaucoma.
Three systematic reviews were identified from other healthcare contexts. One of these, pertaining to maternity 
care, was considered not applicable, particularly owing to the older age group of patients with or at risk of 
glaucoma.54
One systematic review of patient-held records in cancer care was identified. This included seven randomised 1++
controlled trials and found an absence of effect, although most patients welcomed the intervention.55
A third review identified 14, mainly poor-quality, studies across a range of chronic conditions including 
diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and stroke and found no clear evidence of benefit in introducing a patient- 2++
held record. Both clinical and process outcomes were examined.56
There is no evidence on which to base a recommendation for practice.
6.1.3 NAMED OPTOMETRIST
No applicable systematic reviews were identified on the effectiveness of specifying a named optometrist 
when discharging individuals diagnosed with or at risk of glaucoma from secondary-eye-care services.
Evidence from a synthesis of qualitative studies suggests that patients with chronic conditions value continuity

6.2 DISCHARGE CRITERIA
A systematic review of the organisation of eye-care services summarised descriptive studies of shared and 
delegated-care schemes and identified one RCT (n=403) reporting a high level of diagnostic and management 
+
clinical concordance between highly specialist accredited optometrists and consultant ophthalmologists 2
during two years of follow up of patients with glaucoma or suspected glaucoma.58 This finding may be limited 
in its applicability to routine optometry practice in the community.59
No systematic reviews were identified exploring the clinical effectiveness of different discharge criteria.
The following good-practice points for discharge are based on the expertise of the SIGN guideline development 
group applied within the provisions of the GOS arrangements and are informed by the NICE guideline on 
the diagnosis and management of  glaucoma,10 subsequent joint guidance from the College of Optometrists 
and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists53 and an HTA on surveillance for ocular hypertension.15
Development of the criteria has taken account of the views of the eye-care community in Scotland expressed 
during open consultation and the expertise of invited peer reviewers from within and beyond Scotland.
6.2.1 PATIENTS WITH OCULAR HyPERTENSION
 The following groups may be considered for discharge from secondary-eye-care services where 
robust local arrangements are in place for follow up and monitoring in the community. Patients with:
y  untreated ocular hypertension where intraocular pressure is <26 mm Hg, CCT is ≥555 micrometers 
and ocular examination is otherwise normal
y  untreated ocular hypertension with intraocular pressure >25 mm Hg with otherwise normal ocular 
examination and a low lifetime risk of glaucomatous visual disability
y treated ocular hypertension where re-referral criteria are documented.
6.2.2 PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD IRIDOTOMy 
 Patients with primary angle closure who have had prophylactic iridotomy may be considered for 
discharge from secondary-eye-care services if they:
y have confirmed open angle
y are not on topical medication
y have no evidence of glaucoma.
6.2.3 PATIENTS WITH TREATED GLAUCOMA
 Patients with treated glaucoma should normally be monitored in secondary-eye-care services.
Discharge to a locally accredited glaucoma optometrist may be considered at the discretion of the 
consultant ophthalmologist where this is in the best interests of the patient. Robust local arrangements 
for follow up and monitoring should be in place and the frequency of monitoring and criteria for re-
referral should be individualised.

7 Monitoring at-risk groups
7.1 PATIENTS wITH fAMIly HISToRy of GlAuCoMA
   Where family history of glaucoma in a first-degree relative is the sole risk factor identified at routine 
eye examination, the patient should be recalled for review at least every two years. If additional 
risk factors are present the patient should be reviewed annually or more frequently depending on 
clinical judgement.
7.2 PATIENTS wITH oCulAR HyPERTENSIoN
The NICE guideline on the diagnosis and management of glaucoma did not identify any clinical or economic 
evidence on the optimal monitoring interval for patients with ocular hypertension and recommended, based 4
on expert opinion, that monitoring should be based on risk of conversion to glaucoma.10
An evidence synthesis and economic evaluation explored optimal monitoring pathways for people with ocular 
hypertension. A survey of public preferences for a monitoring service identified the importance of keeping 
any side effects of treatment to a minimum and highlighted the value of good communication between 
patients and healthcare professionals. Analysis of the survey also found that patient understanding of the 
monitoring and testing process was an important predictor of the perceived value of a monitoring service.15 2++
Modelling suggests that once reliable baseline measures (IOP (treated or untreated) and visual fields) are 
ascertained there is no clear benefit in intensive monitoring to detect glaucoma. Limited data were available 
on the long-term variability of visual field parameters. Biennial monitoring, by practitioners experienced in 
glaucoma, was more cost effective than more frequent monitoring.15
R  for patients with ocular hypertension, treated or untreated, a reliable baseline based on repeated 
measurement of IoP and perimetry should be established. Repeat glaucoma testing every two 
years is recommended.
 Documentation of baseline optic nerve status is recommended.
 The testing process and, if applicable, potential side effects related to treatment should be fully 
explained to patients.
7.3 PATIENTS wHo HAvE HAD PRoPHylACTIC IRIDoToMy SECoNDARy To PRIMARy ANGlE 
CloSuRE
Primary angle closure (PAC) is diagnosed as occludable angle, normal optic discs and visual fields and any of 
the following: peripheral anterior synechiae, elevated intraocular pressure, iris whirling, ‘glaucomflecken’ lens 
opacities, or excessive pigment deposition on the trabecular surface. Primary angle closure with evidence 
of glaucoma is primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG).60
In one observational study conducted in Scotland, PACG accounted for approximately 23% of all newly 
diagnosed cases of glaucoma.61
No systematic reviews or meta-analyses were identified on the monitoring of patients with PAC after iridotomy 
with healthy discs and full visual field.
Three observational studies; a retrospective study from Canada and two small prospective studies from India 
were identified which provided information on the risk of glaucoma in this patient group. 
18 |
Glaucoma referral and safe discharge 7 • Monitoring at-risk groups
A retrospective single-cohort study (n=257, 469 eyes) examined the risk of IOP elevation and requirement 
for intervention in patients with iridotrabecular contact or peripheral anterior synechiae who had peripheral 
iridotomy carried out. Clock hour of apposition of the angle was not recorded and indentation gonioscopy 3
was not performed. At mean follow up of 8.5 years, 38.7% of the eyes had increased IOP and 17.3% required 
antiglaucoma treatment.62
A small (n=72) prospective single-cohort study reported 36.1% of patients with raised IOP and 11.1% with 
PACG after mean follow up of 6.89 years. This study also reported increased risk of raised IOP/glaucoma in 3
older patients, those with higher baseline IOP and longer follow up. 63 
Another small (n=28) prospective single-cohort study reported that at five years, 28% of patients had 
3
progressed to glaucoma, with or without medications.64
No evidence was identified on which to base recommendations on follow-up interval or on the most 
appropriate healthcare setting for monitoring.
 Patients with primary angle closure or suspected primary angle closure who have undergone successful 
iridotomy require lifelong monitoring which can be carried out in primary care. Monitoring should 
include measurement of intraocular pressure and visual fields as well as assessment of optic discs 
and anterior chamber depth.
7.4 PATIENTS wITH PSEuDoExfolIATIoN
Pseudoexfoliation is one of the most common identifiable causes of glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation 
glaucoma is more severe and difficult to manage than primary open-angle glaucoma.65 Around 30–50% 4 
of patients with pseudoexfoliation will develop glaucoma.66 It is also reported to be associated with angle- 3
closure glaucoma.67
No studies were identified which investigated the monitoring interval for this group of patients.
 Individuals with signs of pseudoexfoliation require ongoing monitoring owing to their increased risk 
of developing glaucoma. If there are no clinical signs of ocular hypertension or glaucoma the patient 
can be monitored in the community.
7.5 PATIENTS wITH PIGMENT DISPERSIoN SyNDRoME 
Patients with pigment dispersion syndrome have an increased risk of developing glaucoma.21 The reported 
risk of conversion of pigment dispersion syndrome to pigmentary glaucoma varies widely from 15% in 15 4 
3
years to 50% in four years, with IOP at presentation being a predictive factor.68
No studies were identified which investigated the monitoring interval for this group of patients.
 Individuals with pigment dispersion syndrome require ongoing monitoring owing to the increased 
risk of developing glaucoma. If there are no clinical signs of ocular hypertension or glaucoma at 
presentation the patient can be monitored in the community. 
7.6 PATIENTS  wITH  oPTIC DISC ANoMAlIES
7.6.1 INTRODUCTION
There are a number of common non-glaucomatous optic nerve head anomalies which can resemble 
glaucomatous disease. Optometrists should follow the relevant clinical guidelines and protocols in keeping 
with each of these conditions and exercise clinical judgement with regard to ongoing monitoring or referral. 
It is considered good practice to use digital image capture to monitor morphological change.

Glaucoma referral and safe discharge
7.6.2 MyOPIC DISCS
No studies were identified which investigated the monitoring interval for this group of patients.
 Individuals with myopic discs require ongoing monitoring owing to the increased risk of developing 
glaucoma. If there are no clinical signs of ocular hypertension or glaucoma at presentation the patient 
can be monitored in the community.
7.6.3 TILTED OPTIC DISC
A review with a limited literature search concluded that tilted optic disc is not associated with any increased 
risk of developing glaucoma.69 Tilted disc can mimic various types of visual field defect suggestive of normal 
-tension glaucoma in the absence of raised intraocular pressure. Careful interpretation of visual fields is 3
necessary to avoid incorrect diagnosis.70 The sensitivity and specificity of newer technologies that image 
the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer in diagnosis of glaucoma in tilted optic disc are reported 
to be very low.69
No studies were identified which investigated the monitoring interval for this group of patients.
 Healthcare practitioners should be aware that tilted optic disc is not associated with any increased 
risk of glaucoma. Visual field defect mimicking glaucoma is common in patients with tilted optic disc, 
but, in contrast to glaucomatous optic damage, the defect is non-progressive, located temporally, 
and not dense.
7.6.4 OPTIC DISC DRUSEN
Optic nerve head drusen (ONHD) can be associated with VFL. A small retrospective cohort study (n=60, 103 
eyes) compared rates of VFL in patients with ONHD with and without ocular hypertension. While 90.9% of 3
eyes with OHT had VFL,  66.7% of normotensive eyes had VFL (p=0.03). At the same intraocular pressure, eyes 
with grade III ONHD are at increased risk for VFL when compared with eyes with grade I ONHD.71
No studies were identified which investigated the monitoring interval for this group of patients.
 Patients with optic nerve head drusen who are normotensive and show no evidence of glaucoma 
can be followed up by community optometrists. Patients with optic nerve head drusen, with ocular 
hypertension and/or a visual field defect require more frequent follow up owing to the increased risk 
of developing glaucoma and should be referred to secondary-eye-care services.

Glaucoma referral and safe discharge 8 • Provision of information
8 Provision of information
8.1 INTRoDuCTIoN
Glaucoma and its risk factors are not well understood, neither by the general public nor among patients. 
This makes early detection and ongoing management of this condition challenging. The lack of knowledge 
and understanding means that patients with this disease, and their carers, are often unable to contribute 
fully to the management of their glaucoma. This is a critical factor in ensuring that patients retain functional 
vision and quality of life for as long as possible. It is important that patients understand their condition and 
its management at the point of diagnosis and into the future. The ideal situation is that patients and carers 
are well informed and fully participate in the decision-making process with their clinical teams to ensure 
the best outcomes through their lifetime of care.
Patient-friendly information delivered at appropriate points in the patient journey, with time given for 
counselling, helps to promote understanding. Educating patients about their condition and  helping them 
manage their eye-drop routines improves patient adherence to  therapy and thereby enhances the chance 
of a successful outcome in the long term.72 
Some groups, for example older people, people with learning disabilities and those in remote areas may 
require mobile facilities to provide access to eye-care services and formal and informal carers may benefit 
from training in eye health and eye care for these individuals.
This section reflects the issues likely to be of most concern to patients and their carers. These points are 
provided for use by healthcare professionals when discussing glaucoma with patients and carers and in 
guiding the production of locally-produced information materials.
8.2 KEy MESSAGES fRoM PATIENTS wITH GlAuCoMA 
A focus group was held with patients who have glaucoma in September 2013. The aim of the focus group 
was to hear about their experiences of services in relation to information provision. Eight people took part, 
six men and two women. The key messages are highlighted in the checklist below,  which also incorporates 
relevant points from the NICE guideline on glaucoma diagnosis and management.10 
8.3 CHECKlIST foR PRovISIoN of INfoRMATIoN
This section gives examples of the information patients and carers may find helpful at the key stages of the 
patient journey. The checklist is neither exhaustive nor exclusive.
General 
y Emphasise the importance of regular eye tests for all individuals.
y  At all times consider language and communication support needs to ensure that people with English 
as a second language, those with learning disability/cognitive impairment and people with visual loss 
receive good-quality accessible information throughout their patient journey.
Initial presentation and referral
y Advise patients of the need for referral to a specialist and of expected waiting times.
y Explain what glaucoma is and what to expect at the appointment with the specialist.
y  Reassure the patient that if the diagnosis is confirmed early, intervention can help preserve useful sight 
and that with effective treatments patients are able to enjoy a good quality of life.
y Highlight the importance of attending the appointment.
y  Advise patients not to drive to the appointment owing to the likelihood of pupil dilation and to take 
along a carer/friend/family member with them if possible.
y Suggest that patients note down any questions and concerns they may wish to discuss at the meeting.
| 21
Glaucoma referral and safe discharge
Secondary-eye-care services
y  Explain procedures to the patient using appropriate language and level of detail and ensure 
comprehension.
y  Discuss the importance of monitoring progression of glaucoma risk factors and emphasise that although 
sight lost with glaucoma cannot be recovered, adherence to treatment can preserve remaining sight.
y Provide information on or referral to local sight support services where appropriate.
y Allow sufficient time for answering any questions patients and carers may have eg:
– what does glaucoma mean?
– what type of glaucoma do I have?
– will I go blind?
– will I need to stay in hospital?
– can I still drive?
y  Where appropriate advise patients of their rights and responsibilities in line with current DVLA 
requirements.
y Where appropriate explain the Certificate of Blindness or Defective Vision and its implications.
y Consolidate verbal information on glaucoma and medication use with written information.
y Consider describing how the medication works to prevent further damage to the optic nerve.
y  Point out that glaucoma often runs in families and that close family members aged over 40 should be 
encouraged to book an appointment at their local optometrist to receive an NHS-funded eye-health 
check. Early detection and treatment of the condition can preserve useful sight and quality of life well 
into old age.
Discharge into the community
y  Provide patients with a copy of their discharge letter and clear information on who to contact should 
they have any concerns.
y Provide patients with written information on their condition.
y Allow sufficient time to discuss the following:
– cleansing eyes and general eye hygiene
– how and when to take medication
– t uition and practice in the most appropriate instillation technique including punctal occlusion and 
use of devices and eye-drop  aids where necessary
– side effects from medication
– storing medication.
y Advise self carers of the local support available and how to access this.
y  Provide patients with information on issues regarding driving with glaucoma, explaining DVLA 
requirements.
y Emphasise the importance of attending follow-up appointments.
y Provide patients with information on eye hygiene.
y  Advise patients to make a note of any questions they have and take it with them to follow-up 
appointments.

9.1 IMPlEMENTATIoN STRATEGy
Implementation of national clinical guidelines is the responsibility of each NHS board and is an essential 
part of clinical governance. Mechanisms should be in place to review care provided against the guideline 
recommendations. The reasons for any differences should be assessed and addressed where appropriate. 
Local arrangements should then be made to implement the national guideline in individual hospitals, units 
and practices. 
9.2 RESouRCE IMPlICATIoNS of KEy RECoMMENDATIoNS 
The guideline development group identified the following resource implications:
y  Requirement for optometrists to purchase pachymeters where these are not currently in use. These will 
cost around £1,500 to £2,000 per item.
y Provision of training for optometrists in use of the DDLS and time out of practice to accommodate this.
y  Primary-care costs associated with developing robust arrangements for follow up and monitoring of 
patients with or at risk of glaucoma following their discharge from secondary-eye-care services. 
y  Secondary-care costs associated with establishing and maintaining discharge protocols. These may 
include the development of a glaucoma register at a national or local level and a hospital-based glaucoma 
co-ordinator to manage referrals to community practitioners and audit referral, discharges and recall 
frequency. 
9.3 AuDITING CuRRENT PRACTICE
A first step in implementing a clinical practice guideline is to gain an understanding of current clinical 
practice. Audit tools designed around guideline recommendations can assist in this process. Audit tools 
should be comprehensive but not time consuming to use. Successful implementation and audit of guideline 
recommendations requires good communication between staff and multidisciplinary team working.
The guideline development group has identified the following as key points to audit to assist with the 
implementation of this guideline:
y  The proportion of referrals from community optometrists to secondary-eye-care services with complete 
information on IOP, visual fields and optic nerve head assessment.
y The number of patients with IOP <26 mm Hg who are referred to secondary-eye-care services.
y The proportion of false positive glaucoma referrals/overall referral accuracy.
y  The number of patients who are discharged from secondary-eye-care services to the community and 
proportion of these who are subsequently re-referred.
y The number of blind/partial sight registrations due to glaucoma.

Glaucoma referral and safe discharge 10 • The evidence base
10  The evidence base
10.1  SySTEMATIC lITERATuRE REvIEw
The evidence base for this guideline was synthesised in accordance with SIGN methodology. A systematic 
review of the literature was carried out using an explicit search strategy devised by a SIGN Evidence and 
Information Scientist. Databases searched include Medline and the Cochrane Library. The year range covered 
was 2007–2014. The main searches were supplemented by material identified by individual members of the 
development group. Each of the selected papers was evaluated by two members of the group using standard 
SIGN methodological checklists before conclusions were considered as evidence.
10.2  RECoMMENDATIoNS foR RESEARCH
The guideline development group was not able to identify sufficient evidence to answer all of the key 
questions asked in this guideline (see Annex 2). The following areas for further research have been identified:
y A comparison of alternative tonometers with investigation of all factors influencing IOP measurements.
y  Studies assessing the level of agreement in CCT readings between currently available devices and a 
reference standard measure.
y Studies assessing the reliability of CCT and need for repeated measures.
y Investigation of the accuracy of referrals based solely on visual field defects.
y Intra- and inter-observer variability in DDLS assessment by optometrist before and after targeted training.
y  Comparisons of agreement and reliability of anterior chamber angle assessment (Van Herick method and 
OCT) in community practice with gonioscopy conducted in the hospital eye service.
y  An update of the OHTS/EGPS five-year glaucoma risk-prediction model to be more applicable for use 
in clinical care.
y  Studies assessing risk of primary angle closure postiridotomy converting into primary angle closure 
glaucoma requiring long-term topical medication or surgical intervention.
y  The comparative effectiveness of alternative monitoring intervals for patients with primary angle-closure 
postiridotomy.
y  The comparative effectiveness of optometry-led versus ophthalmology-led follow up for patients with 
ocular hypertension or glaucoma, to include clinical outcomes and patients’ satisfaction.
y  Cohort data to determine the optimal frequency of monitoring, for those with glaucoma or at risk of 
glaucoma, to detect glaucoma progression.
y Studies assessing the feasibility of a national glaucoma register.
y  Studies assessing components of glaucoma accreditation/qualification for managing patients with or 
at risk of glaucoma in primary care.

tonometers, Perkins. Single readings versus repeat. Diurnal variation and variation within 
settings.
3.  In adult patients where the optometrist suspects ocular hypertension at eye examination, 4.3
does measurement and reporting of central corneal thickness improve referral accuracy when 
provided in addition to intraocular pressure? Which method of pachymetry should be used?
4.  In adult patients where the optometrist suspects glaucomatous disease at eye examination, 4.6
which visual field assessment techniques are associated with the greatest referral accuracy 
or diagnostic accuracy for symptoms suggestive of glaucoma?
Consider: threshold automated perimetry, repeated testing, standard automated perimetry, 
short-wavelength automated perimetry, matrix frequency doubling technology,  Swedish 
Interactive Thresholding Algorithm, Dicon, Henson, Humphrey.
