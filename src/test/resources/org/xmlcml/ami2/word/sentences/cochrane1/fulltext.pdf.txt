1 Introduction
1.1 THE NEED foR A GuIDElINE
The first Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline on antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 
(SIGN 45)1 was published in July 2000 to provide evidence based recommendations to reduce inappropriate 
prophylactic antibiotic prescribing. Evidence from the Scottish Surveillance of Healthcare Associated 
Infection Programme (SSHAIP) on surgical site infection indicates a high compliance with the guideline’s 
recommendations.2 
The original guideline addressed risk factors for surgical site infection (SSI), benefits and risks of antibiotic 
prophylaxis, indications for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis as well as recommendations on administration of 
intravenous prophylactic antibodies. A review was considered timely in light of the ever increasing need to 
use antibiotics wisely, complicated by the increasing prevalence of more resistant organisms such as meticillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
The 2008 update widened the range of surgical procedures covered. New topics included non-intravenous routes 
of administration and multiresistant carriage in patients undergoing surgery. SIGN 45 made recommendations 
for antibiotic prophylaxis in adults. Recommendations for common surgical procedures in children have been 
included in this guideline.
The 2014 update includes an expanded section on Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and timing of 
administration of Antibiotic prophylaxis
1.1.1 UPDATING THE EvIDENCE
The guideline is based on a series of key questions that form the basis of the systematic literature search. 
Key questions were posed to update all sections of SIGN 45 as well as new topics (see Annex 1). Where no 
new evidence was identified to support an update, the guideline text and recommendations are reproduced 
verbatim from SIGN 45. 
The original supporting evidence was not re-appraised by the current guideline development group. The 
evidence in SIGN 45 was appraised using an earlier grading system. Details of how the grading system was 
translated to SIGN’s current grading system are available on the SIGN website (www.sign.ac.uk).
1.2 REmIT of THE GuIDElINE
1.2.1 ovERALL oBJECTIvES
The goals of prophylactic administration of antibiotics to surgical patients are to:
y reduce the incidence of surgical site infection
y use antibiotics in a manner that is supported by evidence of effectiveness
y minimise the effect of antibiotics on the patient’s normal bacterial flora
y minimise adverse effects
y cause minimal change to the patient’s host defences.
It is important to emphasise that surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is an adjunct to, not a substitute for, good 
surgical technique. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be regarded as one component of an effective policy for the 
control of healthcare associated infection. Most of the recommendations in this guideline apply to elective 
surgery but some emergency operations are included (see section 3.1.2).
The guideline is not intended to provide every surgical specialty with a comprehensive text on preventing 
SSI, but rather to provide the evidence for current practice pertaining to antibiotic use, and to provide a 
framework for audit and economic evaluation.
| 1
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
The prevention of SSI by antibiotics encompasses a range of procedures and routes of administration (oral, 
intramuscular, topical) but most evidence relates to the intravenous route. The risk factors for surgical site 
infection, the benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis and the general principles of antibiotic administration 
described in this guideline are based on evidence in adults, but apply equally to children. If the evidence is 
not applicable it has been stated in the text.
The guideline does not cover the following:
y p revention of endocarditis after surgery or instrumentation (this is already covered by a UK guideline 
which is regularly updated)3
y use of antiseptics for the prevention of wound infection after elective surgery
y t reatment of anticipated infection in patients undergoing emergency surgery for contaminated or dirty 
operations
y administration of oral antibiotics for bowel preparation or to achieve selective decontamination of the gut
y most topical antibiotic administration, for example, in wounds or for perineal lavage
y u se of antibiotics for prophylaxis in patients with prosthetic implants undergoing dental  surgery or other 
surgery that may cause bacteraemia
y transplant surgery.
1.2.2 BACKGRoUND
The term surgical site infection is used to encompass the surgical wound and infections involving the body 
cavity, bones, joints, meninges and other tissues involved in the operation (see Annexes 2 and 3). In procedures 
that require the insertion of implants or prosthetic devices the term also encompasses infections associated 
with these devices. Throughout this guideline the term surgical site infection (SSI) is used, unless the evidence 
relates specifically to surgical wound infection.
Prophylactic administration of antibiotics inhibits growth of contaminating bacteria,4-6 and their adherence 
to prosthetic implants, thus reducing the risk of infection. In a survey of antibiotic use in one district general 
hospital in 1978, this indication accounted for approximately one third of all antibiotics prescribed.7 Data 
to update this finding were not identified. Administration of antibiotics also increases the prevalence of 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria,8 and predisposes the patient to infection with organisms such as Clostridium 
difficile, a cause of antibiotic-associated colitis.9
SSI is one of the most common healthcare associated infections (HAI), with one UK study from 2001 showing 
the consequences to be an average additional hospital stay of 6.5 days at a cost of £3,246 per patient.10 The 
consequences for the patient include a longer and more painful stay in hospital. SSI is an important outcome 
measure for surgical procedures.
National mandatory surveillance of SSI was introduced in the UK from 2002 and results indicate the incidence 
of SSI varies by clinical procedure.2 of the seven categories of surgery included, operations for fractured 
neck of femur led to infection most frequently (2.5%) and knee replacements least frequently (0.7%). These 
data also suggest that up to 70% of SSIs occur after discharge from hospital. A prevalence survey of HAI in 
Scotland from 2007 indicated that SSIs were the second most common type of HAI, accounting for 16%.11
1.2.3 TARGET USERS oF THE GUIDELINE
This guideline will be of interest to surgeons, anaesthetists, theatre nurses, pharmacists, radiologists, 
microbiologists, infection control nurses, specialists in public health, specialists in clinical effectiveness and 
clinical governance, and general practitioners.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 1 • Introduction
1.3 DEfINITIoNS
Prophylactic antibiotic The use of antibiotics before, during, or after a diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical 
treatment procedure to prevent infectious complications.12
Therapeutic antibiotic The use of substances that reduce the growth or reproduction of bacteria, 
treatment including eradication therapy.13
This term is used to describe antimicrobial therapy prescribed to clear infection 
by an organism or to clear an organism that is colonising a patient but is not 
causing infection.
1.3.2 PRESCRIBING oF LICENSED MEDICINES oUTWITH THEIR MARKETING AUTHoRISATIoN 
Recommendations within this guideline are based on the best clinical evidence. Some recommendations 
may be for medicines prescribed outwith the marketing authorisation (MA) also known as product licence. 
This is known as ‘off label’ use.1
Medicines may be prescribed off label in the following circumstances:
y for an indication not specified within the marketing authorisation
y for administration via a different route
y for administration of a different dose
y for a different patient population. 
y An unlicensed medicine is a medicine which does not have MA for medicinal use in humans. 
Generally ‘off label’ prescribing of medicines becomes necessary if the clinical need cannot be met by licensed 
medicines within the marketing authorisation. Such use should be supported by appropriate evidence and 
experience.  
“Prescribing medicines outside the conditions of their marketing authorisation alters (and probably increases) 
the prescribers’ professional responsibility and potential liability”.245
The General Medical Council (GMC) recommends that when prescribing a medicine ‘off label’, doctors should:
y  be satisfied that such use would better serve the patient’s needs than an authorised alternative (if one 
exists)
y  be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence/experience of using the medicines to show its safety and 
efficacy, seeking the necessary information from appropriate sources
y  record in the patient’s clinical notes the medicine prescribed and, when not following common practice, 
the reasons for the choice
y t ake responsibility for prescribing the medicine and for overseeing the patient’s care, including monitoring 
the effects of the medicine.
Non-medical prescribers should ensure that they are familiar with the legislative framework and their own 
professional prescribing standards. 
Prior to any prescribing, the licensing status of a medication should be checked in the summary of product 
characteristics (SPC).246 The prescriber must be competent, operate within the professional code of ethics 
of their statutory bodies and the prescribing practices of their employers.247

1.4 STATEmENT of INTENT
This guideline is not intended to be construed or to serve as a standard of care. Standards of care are 
determined on the basis of all clinical data available for an individual case and are subject to change 
as scientific knowledge and technology advance and patterns of care evolve. Adherence to guideline 
recommendations will not ensure a successful outcome in every case, nor should they be construed as 
including all proper methods of care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same 
results. The ultimate judgement must be made by the appropriate healthcare professional(s) responsible 
for clinical decisions regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan. This judgement should only 
be arrived at following discussion of the options with the patient, covering the diagnostic and treatment 
choices available. It is advised, however, that significant departures from the national guideline or any local 
guidelines derived from it should be fully documented in the patient’s case notes at the time the relevant 
decision is taken.
1.4.1 ADDITIoNAL ADvICE To NHSSCoTLAND FRoM HEALTHCARE IMPRovEMENT SCoTLAND AND THE 
SCoTTISH MEDICINES CoNSoRTIUM
Healthcare Improvement Scotland processes multiple technology appraisals (MTAs) for NHSScotland that 
have been produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales.
The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) provides advice to NHS Boards and their Area Drug and Therapeutics 
Committees about the status of all newly licensed medicines and any major new indications for established 
products.
No SMC advice or Healthcare Improvement Scotland validated NICE MTAs relevant to this guideline were 
identified.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 2 • Key recommendations
2 Key recommendations
The following recommendations were highlighted by the guideline development group as being clinically 
very important. They are the key clinical recommendations that should be prioritised for implementation. The 
clinical importance of these recommendations is not dependent on the strength of the supporting evidence. 
The key recommendations were identified using a web based Delphi Decision Aid (http://armstrong.wharton.
upenn.edu/delphi2/). Guideline development group members scored recommendations and good practice 
points on the general principles of antibiotic prophylaxis from 0 to 10 (with 0 being least important and 
10 most important). Recommendations for specific surgical interventions (see section 5) were not included. 
The mean scores were calculated and recommendations achieving over 75% of the maximum score were 
identified as key. Eleven of the 35 guideline development group members responded covering the specialities 
of clinical effectiveness, clinical microbiology, hepatobiliary surgery, implementation, infection control, 
obstetrics, paediatric anaesthetics, pharmaceutical public health, and radiology.
2.1 BENEfITS AND RISKS of ANTIBIoTIC PRoPHylAxIS
 C P atients with a history of anaphylaxis, laryngeal oedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, local 
swelling, urticaria or pruritic rash, occurring immediately after a penicillin therapy are potentially 
at increased risk of immediate hypersensitivity to beta-lactams and should not receive prophylaxis 
with a beta-lactam antibiotic.
  Local policies for surgical prophylaxis that recommend beta-lactam antibiotics as first line agents should 
also recommend an alternative for patients with allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins.
These recommendations are important for patient safety. The risk of penicillin hypersensitivity is important 
and failure to implement these recommendations may have clinically-disastrous results. Another issue is 
over-diagnosis of an allergy, resulting in failure to use a beta-lactam when it would have been suitable.
 D  The duration of prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be single dose except in special 
circumstances (for example, prolonged surgery, major blood loss or as indicated in sections 5.2, 5.3 
and 6.4).
There is still a tendency to give prolonged courses of antibiotics. This recommendation is important to 
prevent over-prescribing, but if a second dose were administered there would be no major consequences 
for the patient.
2.2 ADmINISTRATIoN of PRoPHylACTIC ANTIBIoTICS
 C T he antibiotics selected for prophylaxis must cover the expected pathogens for that operative 
site.
 The choice of antibiotic should take into account local resistance patterns.
Although it appears self evident that the antimicrobial agent chosen should be suitable for the organisms 
likely to be encountered, it is easily forgotten in routine prescribing.
 A single standard therapeutic dose of antibiotic is sufficient for prophylaxis under most circumstances.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
2.3 ImPlEmENTING THE GuIDElINE
 A ll aspects of antibiotic prophylaxis, for example, where prophylaxis is not given when recommended, 
should be clearly recorded in the case records.
 L ocally agreed protocols should clearly indicate where to document antibiotic prophylaxis in the 
patient records (for example, the  ‘once only’ section of the drug chart, integrated care pathway or 
anaesthetic chart).
 R ecord the minimum data set to facilitate audit of the appropriateness of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.
Recording antibiotic prophylaxis is a legal requirement, although it is not always done. These recommendations 
will ensure that it is a routine part of local audit and risk management.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 3 • Risk factors for surgical site infection
3 Risk factors for surgical site infection
3.1 fACToRS AffECTING THE INCIDENCE of SuRGICAl SITE INfECTIoN
There are many risk factors for SSI, which can be classified as patient or operation characteristics (see Table 1).14
Table 1 Factors that influence the risk of SSI14
Risk factor
Patient Extremes of age
Poor nutritional state
obesity (>20% ideal body weight)
Diabetes mellitus
Smoking
Coexisting infections at other sites
Bacterial colonisation (eg nares colonisation with S. aureus)
Immunosuppression (steroid or other immunosuppressive drug use)
Prolonged postoperative stay
operation Length of surgical scrub
Skin antisepsis
Preoperative shaving
Preoperative skin preparation
Length of operation
Antimicrobial prophylaxis
operating theatre ventilation
Inadequate instrument sterilisation
Foreign material in surgical site
Surgical drains
Surgical technique including haemostasis, poor closure, tissue trauma
Postoperative hypothermia15
The US Centres for Disease Control’s (CDC) NNIS (National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance) risk index is 
the method of risk adjustment most widely used internationally.16 Risk adjustment is based on three major 
risk factors:
y the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, reflecting the patient’s state of  health before surgery17
y wound class, reflecting the state of contamination of the wound 
y duration of operation, reflecting technical aspects of the surgery.
3.1.1 CoMoRBIDITIES/ASA SCoRE
The American Society of Anesthesiologists has devised a preoperative risk score based on the presence 
of comorbidities at the time of surgery (see Table 2).17 An ASA score >2 is associated with increased risk of 
wound infection and this risk is additional to that of classification of operation and duration of surgery.16
| 7
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
Table 2 ASA classification of physical status17
ASA score Physical status
1 A normal healthy patient
2 A patient with a mild systemic disease
3 A patient with a severe systemic disease that limits activity, but is not incapacitating
4 A patient with an incapacitating systemic disease that is a constant threat to life
5 A moribund patient not expected to survive 24 hours with or without operation
3.1.2 WoUND CLASS
operations can be categorised into four classes (see Table 3) with an increasing incidence of bacterial 
contamination and subsequent incidence of postoperative infection.16
Table 3 Classification of operation16
Class Definition
Clean operations in which no inflammation is encountered and the respiratory, alimentary 
or genitourinary tracts are not entered. There is no break in aseptic operating theatre 
technique.
Clean- operations in which the respiratory, alimentary or genitourinary tracts are entered but 
contaminated without significant spillage.
Contaminated operations where acute inflammation (without pus) is encountered, or where there 
is visible contamination of the wound. Examples include gross spillage from a hollow 
viscus during the operation or compound/open injuries operated on within four hours.
Dirty operations in the presence of pus, where there is a previously perforated hollow 
viscus, or compound/open injuries more than four hours old.
This guideline applies to all elective operations in the clean, clean-contaminated or contaminated categories. 
Recommendations for prophylaxis of emergency surgery are limited to clean operations (for example, 
emergency repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm or open fixation of a closed fracture) and clean-contaminated 
operations (for example emergency caesarean section and facial trauma).
The guideline development group considered that antibiotic therapy for emergency operations with 
contaminated or dirty wounds is standard therapy rather than prophylaxis and as such is beyond the scope 
of this guideline.
3.1.3 DURATIoN oF SURGERY
Duration of surgery is positively associated with risk of wound infection and this risk is additional to that of 
the classification of operation.16 In this study operations that lasted longer than the 75th percentile for the 
procedure were classified as prolonged.
3.1.4 ExTRINSIC RISK FACToRS
Guidelines for the prevention of SSI, outlining optimum practice, have been published by the CDC.14 Extrinsic 
risks or patient care practices include preoperative skin care, perioperative practices and postoperative 
wound care (see Table 1).
3.1.5 PRoCEDURE SPECIFIC RISKS
Some surgical procedures are associated with specific risks, for example, the insertion of an orthopaedic 
implant increases the risk of SSI.18 Procedures performed endoscopically have been associated with a lower 
risk of infection.18

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 3 • Risk factors for surgical site infection
3.2 PRoBABIlITy of SuRGICAl SITE INfECTIoN
Previous guidelines have referred to patients who are at high risk of SSI but have not provided clear information 
about prediction of risk. This section is intended to illustrate how comorbidity, wound class and duration of 
operation add to the risk defined by type of operative wound.
The NNIS risk index is scored as zero, one, two or three according to the number of risks present (ASA score, 
wound class, duration of operation). The infection rate increases with increasing risk score (see Figure 1).16

The aim of this guideline is to identify the operations for which routine prophylaxis is supported by evidence. 
However, the ultimate decision rests with the surgeon’s assessment of risk and benefit. Giving prophylaxis 
to patients who are having procedures for which this guideline does not recommend prophylaxis can be 
justified if the surgeon believes the patient to be at particularly high risk from SSI. In this case the criteria 
used for risk assessment should be recorded (see section 8.4.2).

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
4 Benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis
 T he final decision regarding the benefits and risks of prophylaxis for an individual patient will depend on:
y the patient’s risk of SSI 
y the potential severity of the consequences of SSI 
y the effectiveness of prophylaxis in that operation (see section 5)
y t he consequences of prophylaxis for that patient (for example, increased risk of Clostridium difficile 
infection).
4.1 BENEfITS of PRoPHylAxIS
In many ways, the value of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in terms of the incidence of SSI after elective surgery is 
related to the severity of the consequences of SSI. For example, in the presence of an anastomosis of the colon, 
prophylaxis reduces postoperative mortality.19 In total hip replacement surgery prophylaxis reduces long term 
postoperative morbidity.20 For most operations, however, prophylaxis only decreases short term morbidity.
3
Surgical site infection increases the length of hospital stay.10 The additional length of stay is dependent on 
the type of surgery.21,22 Prophylaxis has the potential to shorten hospital stay. There is little direct evidence 
that it does so as few randomised trials have included hospital length of stay as an outcome measure. There 
is evidence to indicate that prevention of wound infection is associated with faster return to normal activity 
after discharge from hospital.23
4.2 RISKS of PRoPHylAxIS
one of the aims of rationalising surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is to reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics 
thus minimising the consequences of misuse.
4.2.1 PENICILLIN ALLERGY
Penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics are often the cornerstone of antibiotic prophylaxis. If a patient has 
been wrongly attributed with a penicillin allergy, optimal management may be compromised. Patient history 
is integral to evaluation of allergy.
Important details of an allergic reaction include:24
y signs
y symptoms
y severity 4
y prior reactions
y time course of allergic event
y temporal proximity to and route of other administered drugs
y other medications being taken
y adverse drug events to other medication.
 P atients with a history of penicillin allergy should be reviewed to exclude a non-immunological adverse 
reaction, (for example, diarrhoea, vomiting, non-specific maculopapular rash) or, an experience wrongly 
attributed to the antibiotic (for example, ampicillin and Epstein-Barr virus infection).
Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is generally quoted at 10%. This reflects data collected 
prior to 1980,25 and is confounded by the impurity of the antibiotics in use and tends to overestimate cross- 4
sensitivity. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and second generation cephalosporins is low.25
Studies investigating penicillin allergy, cross-reactivity with cephalosporins and methods to support the 
decision to use a beta-lactam in patients with penicillin allergy focused on the use of skin tests to confirm 
hypersensitivity to specific antibiotics.26-28
10 |
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 4 • Benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis
In patients allergic to penicillins, challenge tests can be used to demonstrate cross-reactions with 
cephalosporins29 and carbapenems.30 The frequency of these relationships and their clinical significance is 2+
uncertain.
Type 1 IgE mediated allergic reactions typically occur within minutes to an hour following exposure.25,31 When 
reactions are  a consequence of previous exposures/sensitisations, they may be seen up to 72 hours (see 4
Table 4).25,31 As this reaction may be life threatening, the potential risks of cross-reactivity generally outweigh 
the potential benefits of using a cephalosporin.

4.2.3 ANTIBIoTIC-ASSoCIATED DIARRHoEA
No evidence was identified on how to reduce the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) in 
patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics.
A single randomised controlled trial (RCT) suggested that the yeast Saccharomyces boulardi, in addition to 
standard antibiotics, reduced the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children from 23% to 8% compared 
+
to placebo (number needed to treat; NNT=8). The incidence of Clostridium difficile was also reduced.32 A meta- 1
analysis of the use of S. boulardi for preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in adults was inconclusive, as 
the studies were heterogeneous and used different definitions of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.33
Treatment with S. boulardi may increase the risk of fungaemia especially in immunocompromised patients. 
More research is required before a recommendation on the use of S. boulardi can be made.33
A study of yoghurt to prevent AAD in adults showed that yogurt twice daily for eight days whilst receiving 
intravenous antibiotics reduced the incidence of AAD from 23 out of 97 to 13 out of 105 patients (p=0.04, 1++
NNT=9). It is unclear whether this treatment would be useful during a short course of prophylactic antibiotic. 
The level of active Lactobacillus in the yoghurt is also difficult to assess.34
4.2.4 Clostridium difficile INFECTIoN
Five per cent of healthy adults are reported to asymptomatically carry low concentrations of Clostridium 
difficile in their colon35 and Clostridium difficile infection (CDI, formerly known as Clostridium difficile associated 
disease or CDAD) is an important healthcare associated infection in healthcare settings in Scotland.219 The 
pathoepidemiology of CDI transmission within healthcare facilities is, however, complex with the risk of 
contracting CDI related to environmental levels of Clostridium difficile contamination. The risk of contracting 
CDI is raised for patients who: 37, 220, 221, 222
y have current or recent use of antimicrobial agents 4
y are elderly
y have a serious underlying illness that compromises their immune system
y have a prolonged stay in a healthcare setting
y have recently had gastrointestinal surgery
y are in hospital when there is an outbreak of CDI
y are using a proton pump inhibitor.
Patients who have been treated with broad spectrum antibiotics are at greatest risk of CDI.37, 220, 223 The 
possibility of CDI should also be considered in patients with diarrhoea who have one or more of these risk 
factors.223
In Scotland, the number of death certificates recording CDI as either an underlying or contributory factor 
in deaths increased rapidly between 2004 and 2008 (from 239 to 765, respectively), before falling to 169 
in 2011.224 In England and Wales the number of death certificates mentioning CDI increased substantially 
between 2004 and 2007, from 2,238 (23.2 per million population) in 2004 to 8,324 (82.2 per million 
population) in 2007, before falling sharply in successive years to 2,053 (19.3 per million population) in 2011. 
This represented a fall from 2.2% of all hospital deaths in England and Wales involving CDI during 2006–08 
to 1.0 % during 2009–11.225 During this period, actions to reduce levels of healthcare associated infections 
including CDI have been implemented in healthcare settings. These include reducing the infection risk 
from improved sterilisation of medical instruments, better antibiotic prescribing, isolating infected patients, 
environmental cleaning and disinfection, and improved hand hygiene.225
It is not clear how many patients develop CDI following antibiotic prophylaxis with rates of 0.2% to 8% reported 
depending on the type of surgical procedure involved.226 The prevalence of CDI is related to a number of 
factors including total antibiotic usage and, in particular, to the use of third generation cephalosporins.39-41 2+
In a case control study of 279 hospital in-patients (93 patients with CDI and 186 matched case controls) 
designed to identify clinical risk factors for CDI, cephalosporin use was one factor associated with CDI (odds 
ratio (oR) 3.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 9.62, p=0.029).227 In a cohort study of 3,904 patients who 
had undergone abdominal surgery, 46 patients (1.2%) developed CDI. After adjustment for age and Charlson 
12 |
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 4 • Benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis
comorbidity score, factors significantly associated with post-surgical CDI included antibiotic use (oR 1.94, 
95% CI 1.07 to 3.52) and, in particular, high-risk antibiotic (third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, 2+
fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and imipenem/meropenem) use (oR 3.42, 95% CI 1.80 to 6.50).226 
Restriction of high-risk antibiotics has been shown to make a contribution to reducing CDI rates.228 In a 
cohort study of 1,331 orthopaedic patients undergoing elective or trauma implant surgery, a change from 
a cephalosporin to a gentamicin-based regimen reduced the frequency of CDI from 4% to 1% (p=0.004); 
the reduction was greater in the trauma patients (from 8% to 3%, p=0.02) than in the elective patients (from 
1% to 0.5%, p=0.27). CDI rates were 8-fold higher in the trauma patients with both antibiotic regimens. The 
+
change of antibiotic protocol did not significantly affect the incidence of deep wound infections in the trauma 2
(p=0.46) or elective (p=0.90) patients.229 In an interrupted time series analysis involving the introduction of 
revised antibiotic guidelines and enhanced antibiotic stewardship (including establishing an antimicrobial 
management team, investigation of high-risk antibiotics, ward rounds and education) in adult medical 
and surgical wards, there was a 58.5% drop in fluoroquinolone use and a 45.8% drop in cephalosporin use 
accompanied by a significant decrease in CDI following the intervention (incidence rate ratio 0.34, 95% CI 
0.20 to 0.58, p=0.0001).230 It is not possible, however, to determine the impact the different components of 
the intervention had on the reduction in CDI.
In epidemiological studies of CDI, surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is the single most common indication for 
use of antibiotics,9 and even single dose prophylaxis increases the risk of carriage of Clostridium difficile.42 
This was shown to be particularly important in the context of a hypervirulent strain of Clostridium difficile 2+
when the risk of CDI increased from 0.7 to 14.9 cases per 1,000 surgical procedures among patients who 
received peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis. During this period, of 7,600 patients who received surgical 
prophylaxis as their sole antibiotic exposure, 1.5% developed CDI.231
There is evidence that multiple doses of cephalosporins increase the risk of CDI more than a single dose. In 
a study of over 1,800 patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture, a change of antibiotic policy from using 2+
three doses of prophylactic cefuroxime (1.5 g) to one single dose of cefuroxime (1.5 g) with gentamicin (240 
mg) resulted in a decrease in CDI from 4.2% to 1.6% (p=0.009).232
 C I n patients requiring antibiotic prophylaxis the risk of Clostridium difficile infection should always 
be considered and the higher risk of Clostridium difficile infection associated with some antibiotics 
(cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, carbapenems) should be taken into account when 
prescribing.
In most cases, single dose prophylaxis is recommended (see section 6.4). Exceptions to this include arthroplasty 
and extended cardiac surgery (see section 6.4.1). 
4.2.5 ANTIBIoTIC RESISTANCE
Rates of antibiotic resistance are increasing in all hospitals.43,44 The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in any 
population is related to the proportion of the population that receives antibiotics, and the total antibiotic 
exposure.45-47
Increased antibiotic use leads to more resistance as demonstrated by a variety of large and small scale 
studies.48-50
Three uncontrolled observational studies showed that when antibiotics were given for surgical prophylaxis 
there was an increased risk of the patients treated acquiring antibiotic resistant strains following treatment.51-53 
Two trials of patient exposure to a single dose of either ciprofloxacin or vancomycin showed an absolute 
3
increase in the number of people with resistant organisms following treatment compared to pre-treatment 
(4 v 8%).51,52 Prolonged prophylaxis (>48 hour) in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was associated 
with an increased risk of acquired antibiotic resistance (oR of 1.6). No information was available about patient 
selection and only 41% of patients had cultures taken.53
| 13
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
A small study comparing short-term (24 hour) with longer-term (five day) prophylaxis following excision of 
head and neck lesions found significantly fewer patients with wounds infected by MRSA in the short-term 2+
group (4/33 compared with 13/31, p=0.01).54
 D T he duration of prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be single dose except in special circumstances 
(for example prolonged surgery, major blood loss or as indicated in sections 5.2, 5.3 and 6.4).
4.2.6 MULTIRESISTANCE CARRIAGE
No evidence was identified to show whether carriage of multiresistant organisms is associated with more 
frequent postoperative surgical site infection than carriage of sensitive strains.
In medical patients, carriage of MRSA is strongly predictive of subsequent MRSA infection in the short- or 2+ 
long-term.55-58 3
Extrapolation of this data to surgical patients suggests that MRSA carriage may be a risk factor for SSI. 
Preoperative care and choice of prophylactic antibiotic may need to be modified where patients are colonised 
with MRSA (see section 6.1.1).
 C arriage of multiresistant organisms should be recognised as a potential risk factor for surgical site 
infection during high risk operations (for example orthopaedic implant, heart valve, vascular graft or 
shunt or CABG).
 F or patients with suspected multiresistance carriage undergoing high risk operations preoperative 
care should include:
y screening for relevant organisms
y changing the antibiotic of choice for prophylaxis.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 5 • Indications for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis
+ 5 Indications for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis2
5.1 INTRoDuCTIoN
Section 5.2 summarises the recommended indications for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. The recommendations 
are based on the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the incidence 
of SSI.
Antibiotic prophylaxis should be used where evidence of benefit exists and should not be considered if 
there is evidence of a lack of efficacy.
There is a paucity of evidence for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in children. Section 5.3 summarises the 
recommended indications for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in children (birth to 16 years of age). Where 
no evidence was identified, recommendations for common paediatric procedures, the general principles of 
antibiotic prophylaxis for clean-contaminated surgery and insertion of prosthetic devices are extrapolated 
from evidence of efficacy in adults. Where there is no significant difference from practice in adults and no 
specific recommendations are made for children, the recommendations in section 5.2 should apply.
Four different recommendations have been made regarding surgical antibiotic prophylaxis:
y  Highly recommended: prophylaxis unequivocally reduces major morbidity, reduces hospital costs and 
is likely to decrease overall consumption of antibiotics
y  Recommended: prophylaxis reduces short term morbidity, reduces hospital costs and may decrease 
overall consumption of antibiotics
y  Should be considered: prophylaxis should be considered for all patients. Local policy makers may wish 
to identify exceptions, as prophylaxis may not reduce hospital costs and could increase consumption 
of antibiotics, especially if given to patients at low risk of infection. Any local policy that recommends 
restriction of prophylaxis to ‘high-risk’ patients must specify and justify the threshold of risk. Moreover, 
such a policy requires continuous documentation of wound infection rates in order to provide evidence 
that the risk of surgical site infection in patients who do not receive prophylaxis is below the specified risk 
threshold. In addition, for clean-contaminated procedures or procedures involving insertion of prosthetic 
devices, good quality evidence for the clinical effectiveness of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is lacking. 
This is either because trials have not been done or have been done with such small numbers of patients 
that important treatment effects cannot be excluded.15
y  Not recommended: prophylaxis has not been proven to be clinically effective and as the consequences 
of infection are short term morbidity, it is likely to increase hospital antibiotic consumption for little 
clinical benefit.
The recommendations are presented in tabular form in sections 5.2 and 5.3, which also lists the odds ratio 
(oR) for the risk of wound infection and numbers needed to treat (NNT), ie the number of patients that must 
receive prophylaxis in order to prevent one wound infection. The method of calculation of NNT from baseline 
risk and odds ratio is given in Annex 6.
Where possible the oRs and NNTs have been taken from published meta-analyses. In some cases, however, 
data from pooled trials has been combined without formal meta-analysis. In other cases, NNTs and oRs from 
individual trials are presented (see supporting material for this guideline on the SIGN website: www.sign.ac.uk).
A negative NNT indicates that the treatment has a harmful effect and is referred to as the number needed 
to harm (NNTH).

Two meta-analyses were identified comparing the efficacy of ceftriaxone with other antibiotics in reducing 
surgical site infection. The risk reduction (RR) of respiratory tract infection (RTI) and urinary tract infection 
(UTI) after prophylactic antibiotic treatment was analysed.147,148
one meta-analysis of 48 non-placebo controlled RCTs (including breast, cardiovascular, maxillofacial, 
neurological, orthopaedic, abdominal, obstetric and urologic surgery) showed that RTIs were reduced after 
antibiotic prophylaxis in clean and clean-contaminated surgery.148 UTIs were reduced only in clean-contaminated 
surgery (RTI, oR -0.30; UTI, oR -0.54),148 although a second meta-analysis of 43 non-placebo controlled RCTs 1+
(including abdominal, colorectal, orthopaedic, cardiothoracic, obstetric and gynaecological surgery and 
appendicectomy) showed that prophylactic antibiotics during surgery prevent UTI but not RTI.147
There was no significant reduction in RTI after antibiotic prophylaxis compared to placebo in an RCT of head 
and neck surgery.149
Another meta-analysis compared cephalosporins at any dosage with placebo and multiple doses with 24 hour 
antibiotic coverage in orthopaedic surgery.139 Postoperative UTI was shown to be prevented in three studies 
++
of antibiotic prophylaxis compared to placebo. The included studies were all of patients with orthopaedic/ 1
hip fracture. These patients may be elderly, and have an indwelling catheter or asymptomatic bacteriuria. 
They may also be at high risk of C. diff infection, so antibiotics should be used cautiously.
 A  Prophylactic antibiotic treatment during surgery solely for the prevention of urinary or respiratory 
tract infection is not recommended.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
6 Administration of prophylactic antibiotics
6.1 CHoICE of ANTIBIoTIC
Although a wide range of organisms can cause infection in surgical patients, SSI is usually due to a small 
number of common pathogens (except in the presence of implanted biomaterial: see Annex 4). only these 4
need to be covered by the antibiotic that is prescribed.14
 C T he antibiotics selected for prophylaxis must cover the expected pathogens for that operative 
site.
The antibiotics chosen for prophylaxis can be those used for active treatment of infection. The chosen 
antibiotics must reflect local, disease-specific information about the common pathogens and their 
antimicrobial susceptibility.
 L ocal antibiotic policy makers have the experience and information required to make recommendations 
about specific drug regimens based on an assessment of evidence, local information about resistance 
and drug costs.
 The choice of antibiotic should take into account local resistance patterns.
Three meta-analyses were identified comparing cephalosporins to other antibiotics.147,148,150 All were of non-
uniformity studies tailored to the trial antibiotic. Details about dosage were lacking.
In meta-analyses of heterogeneous studies, perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis with ceftriaxone showed a 
decrease in the relative risk of SSI of 30% compared to other cephalosporins,147 and a 22% reduction compared 1++ 
+
to a range of antibiotics.148 Given the heterogeneity of the studies the conclusion that ceftriaxone is better 1
cannot be sustained for any particular surgical site.
The increased risk of C. diff associated disease with third-generation cephalosporins should also be considered 2+
(see section 4.2.4).39-41
A meta-analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis for cardiac surgery showed no difference in effectiveness between 
beta-lactams and glycopeptides in reducing the risk of SSI. Beta-lactams were superior to glycopeptides for 1+
reducing the risk of deep sternal wound infection. Glycopeptides were more effective than beta-lactams for 
reducing the risk of leg SSI at leg vein harvest sites.150
 Narrow spectrum, less expensive antibiotics should be the first choice for prophylaxis during surgery.
A history of a serious adverse event should preclude administration of a particular antibiotic (see section 
4.2.1). Annex 5 shows a table of the antibiotics most frequently used for surgical prophylaxis.
6.1.1 MULTIRESISTANCE CARRIAGE
MRSA carriage may be a risk factor for SSI (see section 4.2.6). SSI can cause major morbidity in patients 
undergoing high–risk procedures (see Table 5).
 Patients known to carry MRSA should have a course of eradication therapy prior to high–risk surgery.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 6 • Administration of prophylactic antibiotics
A meta-analysis of perioperative prophylaxis with intranasal mupirocin in adult non-general surgery 
(cardiothoracic, orthopaedic and neurosurgery) showed a decrease in the incidence of SSI in two RCTs (RR 
0.80; confidence interval, CI, 0.58 to 1.10) and three non-randomised controlled trials (RR 0.40; CI 0.29 to 
0.56). There was no decrease in SSI in general surgery.151 In one of the trials the overall SSI rate caused by S. 
1+
aureus was similar in both the placebo and mupirocin arms.152 In a study of orthopaedic surgery the rate of 
endogenous S. aureus wound infections (defined as infections caused by an isolate identical to the nasal 
strain already carried) was five times lower after perioperative intranasal mupirocin, although there was no 
overall reduction in SSI rate by S. aureus.153
A further observational study in orthopaedic surgery showed using intranasal mupirocin produced a 2+
reduction in SSI rates.154
 B  Intranasal mupirocin should be used prophylactically for adult patients undergoing surgery with 
a high risk of major morbidity who are identified with S. aureus or mRSA.
 In the presence of known mupirocin resistance another topical preparation may be used. 
A meta-analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis for cardiac surgery showed that glycopeptides are more effective 1+
than beta-lactams for preventing SSI caused by MRSA.150
 W here antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated, patients undergoing high risk surgery who are MRSA positive 
should receive a suitable antibiotic active against local strains of MRSA.
 A  A glycopeptide should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing high–risk 
surgery who are mRSA positive.
6.2 TImING of ADmINISTRATIoN
The time taken for an antibiotic to reach an effective concentration in any particular tissue reflects its 1+
pharmacokinetic profile and the route of administration.156
Antibiotic prophylaxis administered too late or too early reduces the efficacy of the antibiotic and may 1+
increase the risk of SSI.19, 157-159
Administration of prophylaxis more than three hours after the start of the operation significantly reduces 1+
its effectiveness.160
A study of 3,836 patients undergoing abdominal, vascular or trauma surgery given a single dose of cefuroxime 
(plus metronidazole for colorectal cases) compared the rate of SSI for time intervals between 0 and 2 hours 
prior to the procedure. The overall SSI rate was 4.7% and administration of antibiotic prophylaxis 30–60 
minutes pre-incision resulted in the lowest rates of SSI (2.42% for 45–59 minutes and 3.33% for 30–44 
minutes). The odds of SSI rose significantly when the antibiotics were applied less than 30 minutes (adjusted 
oR 1.95, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8, p<0.001) and 120 to 60 minutes before surgery (adjusted oR 1.74, 95% CI 1.04 to 
2.93, p<0.035).235
2+
In a case control study of 989 paediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery between 2000 and 
2006, an analysis of 36 patients who developed a deep SSI compared with 72 controls who did not showed 
that timing of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was an independent and modifiable risk factor for deep 
SSI. The rate of deep SSI was higher in those receiving antibiotic prophylaxis more than 60 minutes before 
incision (oR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4 to 3.5) or after incision (oR 4.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 15.5) compared with those who 
received antibiotic prophylaxis within 60 minutes before incision. The authors concluded that preoperative 
antibiotic prophylaxis should be given within 60 minutes before incision to reduce the risk of deep SSI in 
this patient population.236
| 25
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
Two large-scale studies from the USA looking at risk of SSI in 4,472 randomly selected cardiac, hip/knee 
arthroplasty, and hysterectomy cases,237 and 4,453 general surgery cases,238 showed lower risk of SSI with 
shorter times between antibiotic administration and skin incision. In the first study, 109 patients developed 
an SSI and the infection risk was 1.6% when antibiotics were administered within 30 minutes prior to 
incision compared to 2.4% for administration between 31 and 60 minutes prior to surgery (oR 1.74, 95% 2+
CI 0.98 to 3.04).237 In the second study, 10% of patients developed an infectious complication (n=444), with 
risk of infection decreasing as antibiotic administration moved closer to incision time with the lowest rate 
corresponding to administration four minutes before incision (95% one-sided CI, 0–18 minutes). Modelling 
suggests that infections could be reduced by 11.3% by moving antibiotic administration closer to incision.238.
Evidence regarding the optimal timing of antibiotic prophylaxis is currently conflicting and based on studies 
including different types of surgical procedure. Shorter times between antibiotic administration and skin 
incision may result in lower rates of surgical site infection for some procedures.
 B  for surgical procedures, intravenous prophylactic antibiotics should be given within 60 minutes 
before the skin is incised and as close to time of incision as practically possible.
 vancomycin should be given by intravenous infusion starting 90 minutes prior to skin incision.
6.2.1 CAESAREAN SECTIoN
In women undergoing Caesarean section, advice on the timing of administration of prophylactic antibiotics 
has tended to favour administration at the time of cord clamping rather than prior to incision because of 
perceived concerns about unnecessary exposure of the foetus to these agents. Recent guidance from NICE 4
and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends that for Caesarean section, antibiotics 
should be given pre-skin incision.234,239
A 2009 review of 15 studies of mixed design concluded that the use of either cefazolin alone before surgical 
incision or an extended spectrum regimen after cord clamping was associated with a reduction in post-
caesarean maternal infection.240 This review included an earlier meta-analysis of three RCTs including 300 
patients, that found that preoperative administration of cefazolin significantly reduced the risk of postpartum 
endometritis (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.85, p=0.012) and total infectious morbidity (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33 2+
to 0.78, p=0.002) without affecting neonatal outcomes.241 A retrospective cohort study, also included in 
the review, of 1,316 term, singleton caesarean deliveries found that a policy switch to giving prophylactic 
antibiotics before skin incision rather than after cord clamping resulted in a decline in overall SSI (adjusted 
oR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.76).242 
Two more recent RCTs, however, including 400 women and 434 women, 243,244 found that time of antibiotic 
prophylaxis application did not change maternal infectious morbidity in Caesarean section deliveries. 1++
They also concluded that neonatal morbidity rates are unaffected by timing although studies may not be 
sufficiently powered to confirm this finding.
No evidence suggesting that antibiotic administration either before skin incision or after cord clamping 
adversely affects neonatal morbidity was identified.
No evidence was identified to determine the optimal timing of antibiotic administration pre-incision in 
Caesarean section. Current practice is to administer the antibiotics as close to time of incision as practically 
possible and evidence from other types of surgery suggests this should be within 60 minutes before the 
skin is incised.
 B f or Caesarean section, antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce maternal infectious complications can be 
given pre-incision or after cord clamping
 I f prophylaxis is given post cord clamping, local surgical site infection rates should be monitored and 
a change to pre-incision antibiotics considered if rates are higher than expected.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 6 • Administration of prophylactic antibiotics
6.3 DoSAGE SElECTIoN
It is generally accepted as good practice that the dosage of an antibiotic required for prophylaxis is the same 
as that for the therapy of infection.
 A single standard therapeutic dose of antibiotic is sufficient for prophylaxis under most circumstances.
6.4 DuRATIoN of PRoPHylAxIS
++ 
For many types of commonly performed surgery there is consistent evidence that a single dose of 1
1+ 
antimicrobial with a long enough half-life to achieve activity throughout the operation is adequate.108,162,163 2+
The in vitro activity of antibiotics, which may be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis, is shown in Annex 5.
There is evidence from several studies of antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery that longer dosage duration 
has no increased benefit over a short course (see Table 6).

 B  A single dose of antibiotic with a long enough half-life to achieve activity throughout the operation

In arthroplasty there is evidence from a very large observational cohort that 24 hours of antimicrobial 2++
prophylaxis is associated with lower rates of re-operation than a single dose.136
 B up to 24 hours of antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for arthroplasty.
6.4.1 ADDITIoNAL DoSAGE DURING THE oPERATIoN
A single cohort study looking at cardiac operations showed that one dosage of cefazolin is as effective as 
two for short cardiac surgeries (<240 min), but intraoperative redosing with cefazolin in operations longer 2++
than four hours resulted in a 16% decrease in overall infection rate bringing the infection rate down to 
similar to shorter surgeries.98
 C A n additional intraoperative dosage of antibiotic is recommended for cardiac surgery longer than 
four hours when using an antibiotic with pharmacokinetics equivalent to cefazolin.
Apart from the above example, no evidence was identified for additional intraoperative dosage.
  Additional dosage may be indicated for longer surgery or shorter-acting agents to maintain activity 
for the duration of the operation.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
6.4.2 BLooD LoSS, FLUID REPLACEMENT AND ANTIBIoTIC PRoPHYLAxIS
Serum antibiotic concentrations are reduced by blood loss and fluid replacement, especially in the first hour 3
of surgery when drug levels are high.49,164,165
The precise effects of blood loss and fluid replacement are difficult to predict and will depend upon the 
particular antibiotic used, the time and rate of blood loss and fluid replacement.
A small pharmacokinetic analysis of cloxacillin levels in children undergoing major facial and neck surgery 
showed that the associated massive blood loss led to serum cloxacillin concentrations below therapeutic 
levels for significant proportions of surgery.49 3
In a small prospective study of 11 adults undergoing elective surgical spinal instrumentation procedures 
with an expected large blood loss there was a significant correlation between blood loss and tissue cefazolin 
concentration. Where there was significant blood loss (>1,500 ml) and the surgery lasted over three hours 
the tissue concentration of cefazolin fell below the minimum inhibitory concentration.166
 I n the event of major intraoperative blood loss in adults (>1,500 ml) additional dosage of prophylactic 
antibiotic should be considered after fluid replacement.
 I n the event of major intraoperative blood loss in children (25 ml/kg) additional dosage of prophylactic 
antibiotic should be considered after fluid replacement.
6.5 RouTE of ADmINISTRATIoN
Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis, typically given by the parenteral intravenous route (Iv), has historically proven 
to be a reliable and effective prophylaxis against SSI in all types of surgery.
 Prophylactic antibiotics for surgical procedures should be administered intravenously.
6.5.1 oRAL ADMINISTRATIoN
Serum and tissue concentrations after oral administration are determined in part by the rate of absorption, 
which varies between individuals. There is relatively little evidence about the effectiveness of orally administered 
antibiotic prophylaxis. A further problem is that often the correct time of administration is difficult to guarantee 
in practice, because, for example, it occurs outwith the theatre environment.
Administration of fluoroquinolones by the oral route achieves comparable serum and tissue levels to antibiotic 
prophylaxis via the Iv route.127,167-175
Intensive antibiotic use and in particular fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins contributes significantly to 
the two major antibiotic resistance issues that confront hospitals today, namely MRSA and C. diff.174-178 In any 
patient known to be carrying MRSA it is unwise to prescribe these agents, as this may lead to overgrowth 
of MRSA and higher subsequent risk of infection. Similarly, as short a course of prophylactic antibiotic as 
possible will keep the risk of symptomatic C. diff to a minimum.
6.5.2 ToPICAL ADMINISTRATIoN
High-risk surgery
There is evidence that supplementary application of resorbable gentamicin-impregnated collagen fleeces 
after abdominoperineal excision of rectal cancer179 or gentamicin-collagen implant between the two halves 1+
of the sternum after cardiac surgery, may minimise wound infection after surgery.180,181
Results from studies on the use of intranasal mupirocin to prevent SSI are inconsistent due to small sample 
size, design differences and mixed surgical groups. A meta-analysis suggests that its use should be considered 1+
in non-general surgery, for example, cardiothoracic or orthopaedic procedures (see section 6.1.1).151
 B I ntranasal mupirocin should be used prophylactically for patients undergoing high–risk surgery 
who are identified with S. aureus or mRSA.
28 |
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 6 • Administration of prophylactic antibiotics
Additional work is needed to determine whether intranasal mupirocin should be combined with screening 
for nasal carriage in order that a targeted approach for its use be adopted.
Grommet insertion
The level of otorrhea was 8.75% in patients receiving topical antibiotics for five days after grommet insertion 
compared to 30% in the non-treatment group. This was not significantly different to the rate of infection 
following the use of oral antibiotics for five days.80 Topical administration of a single dose of antibiotic was more 1++ 
effective than no treatment in preventing postoperative otorrhea (p=0.029).82 A single topical application was 1+ 
not significantly different to topical treatment for five days for reducing postoperative infection after grommet 2++
placement (8.4% and 8.2%), but was more effective than no treatment (16.5%). There was no significant difference 
between single application and five days.81
 B A single dose of topical antibiotic is recommended for insertion of grommets.
6.5.3 oTHER RoUTES oF ADMINISTRATIoN
Joint replacement
A large retrospective study showed that a combination of Iv prophylactic antibiotic and antibiotic-
impregnated bone cement is more effective than Iv prophylaxis alone in reducing the risk of SSI. Compared 
2++
to the combined regimen, patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis only systemically had a 1.4 times 
higher revision rate with all reasons for revision as the end point (p=0.001), 1.3 times higher with aseptic 
loosening (p=0.02) and 1.8 times higher with infection as the end point (p=0.01).136
 B  In addition to intravenous antibiotics, impregnated cement is recommended for cemented joint 
replacements.
Cataract surgery
During cataract surgery prophylactic cefuroxime administered intracamerally reduces the risk of developing 
1++
endophthalmitis to one fifth of the risk if no prophylactic antibiotic is used.182 
 A Intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for cataract surgery.
Penetrating eye injuries
Prophylactic antibiotics (vancomycin and ceftazidime) administered intravitreally prevent severe intraocular 
infection after open globe injury (compared to no intravitreal antibiotics, (p=0.03).65 In eyes with an intraocular 1+
foreign body, intracameral or intravitreal administration of gentamicin and clindamycin following primary repair 
reduces the incidence of endophthalmitis compared to balanced salt solution (p=0.04).66
 B  Intracameral or intravitreal intraocular antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended at completion of 
surgery for penetrating eye injuries (dependent on extent of injury and the presence or absence of 
an intraocular foreign body).
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection
In adults, intraventrical prophylactic antibiotic at time of insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal (vP) shunt 
2-
reduced the shunt infection from 6% to 0.4% (RR 0.7, p=0.0001).183

6.5.4 ANTIBIoTIC-IMPREGNATED DEvICES IN NEURoSURGERY
An RCT of permanent-impregnated CSF shunts compared to non-impregnated shunts in adults and children 
showed a significant reduction in infection rate when the impregnated device was used (10/60 versus 3/50, 
p=0.038).184 The overall shunt infection rate was high in this study. Two cohort studies of impregnated CSF 
shunts in children showed a 2.4-fold reduction in infection rate in 145 patients compared to 208 historical 1+ 
controls,185 and 1/31 patients with shunt infection compared to 7/46 historical controls.186 A six centre RCT 2+
of antibiotic-impregnated external ventricular drains showed a 50% risk reduction in colonisation of the 
catheter (17.9% compared to 36.7% control catheters, p<0.0012) and a 70% reduction in positive CSF cultures 
from patients with antibiotic-impregnated catheters (1.3% compared to 9.4% of control, p=0.002).187 There 
is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of antimicrobial-impregnated CSF shunts.
 C Routine use of impregnated devices in neurosurgery is not recommended.
 Impregnated devices may be considered if local CSF infection rates are high.
6.5.5 ANTIMICRoBIAL-IMPREGNATED CENTRAL vENoUS CATHETERS
A meta-analysis of antimicrobial-impregnated and heparin-bonded central venous catheters (CvC) identified 
11 studies, only one of which reported on antibiotic-impregnated CvCs.188 Using antimicrobial-impregnated 1++
or heparin-bonded CvCs reduces catheter related bloodstream infections by 2.32% (95% CI 1.04% to 3.61%)188. 
There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of antimicrobial-impregnated CvCs.
The use of impregnated CvCs should not replace best clinical practice for inserting CvCs.189 4
 A Routine use of antimicrobial-impregnated central venous catheters is not recommended.

A set of  ‘top five tips’ to combat healthcare associated infection in hospital was issued by the Chief Medical

y  Think about keeping patients safe before you visit. If you or someone at home has a cold or are feeling 
unwell, especially if it’s diarrhoea, stay away until you’re better.
y  Think about what you take in to patients. Food is a treat best saved until they get home. Don’t sit on the 
bed and keep the number of visitors to a minimum at any one time.
y  The most important thing you can do is to wash and dry your hands before visiting the ward, particularly 
after going to the toilet. If there is alcohol hand gel provided at the ward door or at the bedside, use it.
y Never touch dressings, drips, or other equipment around the bed.
y  Don’t be afraid to raise concerns with members of staff in your hospital. Busy doctors can sometimes 
forget simple things like cleaning hands before examining a patient. No NHS worker should take offence 
at a gentle and polite reminder.
7.3 SuRGICAl SITE INfECTIoN
7.3.1 PREoPERATIvE INFoRMATIoN
Explain to patients that surgical operations carry risks, one of which is the risk of infection at the site of surgery, 
known as surgical site infection (SSI). The risk of SSI is different for different surgical procedures. Antibiotic 
prophylaxis can reduce the risk of surgical site infection. Not all operations require antibiotic prophylaxis 
and not all surgical site infections are preventable.
Antibiotic prophylaxis carries a small risk of anaphylaxis. overuse of antibiotics can lead to the development 
of micro-organisms that are resistant to certain antibiotics.
  All surgical departments should have information leaflets for patients about specific surgical 
procedures.
  Healthcare professionals should discuss the risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the 
risk of SSI with the patient.

8 Implementing the guideline
This section provides advice on the resource implications associated with implementing the key clinical 
recommendations, and advice on audit as a tool to aid implementation.
Implementation of national clinical guidelines is the responsibility of each NHS Board and is an essential 
part of clinical governance. Mechanisms should be in place to review care provided against the guideline 
recommendations. The reasons for any differences should be assessed and addressed where appropriate. 
Local arrangements should then be made to implement the national guideline in individual hospitals, units 
and practices.
8.1 CoST EffECTIVENESS of ANTIBIoTIC PRoPHylAxIS
The aims of this section are:
y to outline the cost considerations related to surgical antibiotic prophylaxis
y t o provide some rules of thumb that a decision maker can use to estimate the likely cost effectiveness of 
embarking upon a particular preventative strategy for surgical site infection.
very few prospective randomised trials of surgical prophylaxis have included economic evaluation within 
the trial design. There are some evaluations that combine evidence of effectiveness of prophylaxis with 
estimates of the additional costs of treating wound infection. As described in section 5.1, the effectiveness 
of prophylaxis can be estimated using an odds ratio for risk of wound infection. This, together with the rate 
of wound infection for that procedure in the hospital, is used to calculate the numbers needed to treat (NNT,

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 8 • Implementing the guideline
8.2 PoSSIBlE CoST-EffECTIVENESS DECISIoN RulES foR ImPlEmENTING ANTIBIoTIC 
PRoPHylAxIS
The following worked examples illustrate the application of two possible decision rules for implementing 
antibiotic prophylaxis:
Rule 1: Prophylaxis should be given if it is likely to reduce overall antibiotic consumption in the hospital.
Rule 2: Prophylaxis should be given if it is likely to reduce overall hospital costs.
Note: these decision rules are addressing the ‘worst case’ for assessing the cost effectiveness of prophylaxis, 
which is that prophylaxis can only be justified on the grounds that it saves hospital resources. This ignores 
the undoubted health gain to the patient from avoiding surgical site infection and any effects resulting from 
antibiotic resistance arising from population exposure to antibiotics.
Rule 1: Prophylaxis should be given if it is likely to reduce overall antibiotic consumption in the hospital.
Example A: Calculating antibiotic consumption in relation to antibiotic prophylaxis
Suppose that the antibiotic treatment regimen used for SSI following a specific surgical procedure is 
usually 3 doses per day for 7 days, the total number of doses (the therapeutic antibiotic consumption 
would be 21.
The method for calculating how many doses of prophylaxis must be given in order to prevent one 
SSI is as follows:
Suppose the odds ratio of wound infection with prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis for the operation 
=0.3
Baseline risk of wound infection without prophylaxis=10%
Using the equation in Annex 6, the NNT=15
From Table 7 at a baseline risk of 10%, the NNT=15
Therefore 15 patients must receive one dose of prophylaxis in order to prevent one wound infection, 
which would take 21 doses to treat. Therefore it would be reasonable to give prophylactic doses 
of antibiotic.
An alternative way of looking at this is:
To minimise overall hospital consumption of antibiotic usage, if 21 doses of therapeutic antibiotic 
would need to be given for treatment of an SSI, fewer than 21 people would need to be given 
prophylactic doses to prevent one SSI.
Table 7 shows that the expected baseline risk at which NNT>21 for an odds ratio of 0.3 is about 7%.
If the baseline risk of wound infection after the specific surgery in a hospital is less than 7% it 
would be reasonable to be concerned that giving prophylaxis routinely would increase overall 
hospital consumption of antibiotics.
If the baseline risk is more than 7% it would be reasonable to assume that giving prophylaxis 
would not increase overall antibiotic consumption.
  Use NNTs to compare when the consumption of prophylactic antibiotics would be lower than the 
consumption of therapeutic antibiotics.
Focusing debate about prophylaxis on the likelihood of reducing overall antibiotic consumption highlights 
the importance of aiming to restrict prophylaxis to a single dose. Every additional prophylactic dosage that is 
administered increases the baseline risk of wound infection that is required for prophylaxis to reduce overall 
antibiotic consumption. 
| 35
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
If a second prophylactic dosage is administered after the operation and does not further reduce the risk of 
wound infection, then in example A, 30 doses instead of 15 are being administered to prevent one wound 
infection. As the NNT is the number of patients who must be treated, this remains at 15 with each patient 
now receiving two antibiotic doses.
This two-dose regimen would only reduce overall antibiotic consumption if the number of patients treated 
to prevent one wound infection is seven or lower, then the number of prophylactic doses (14) would be less 
than the number of doses needed to treat one wound infection (15). This would be the case if the baseline 
risk of wound infection were at least 15% (see Table 7).
Rule 2: Prophylaxis should be given if it is likely to reduce overall hospital costs
Example B: Calculation of the cost per wound infection avoided
Table 7 can also be used to calculate the number of patients who must receive prophylaxis in order 
to prevent one wound infection (the NNT).
Multiplying NNT by the cost of prophylaxis gives the cost of preventing one wound infection. 
For example, for the specific surgery, if the odds ratio= 0.3 and the estimated baseline risk of wound 
infection=10%, then the NNT=15
If prophylaxis costs eg £5 per patient then it costs £75 (ie £5 x 15) to prevent one wound infection.
This provides a threshold value. If the decision maker believes that it is good value to spend up to 
£75 to prevent a wound infection then prophylaxis should be implemented.
The prophylaxis cost of avoiding one wound infection of £75 is far less than estimated costs of treating a wound 
infection published in 1992, which ranged from £367 to £1,404,22 and prophylaxis should be considered.
8.2.1 CALCULATING THE CoMPARATIvE CoSTS oF PRoPHYLAxIS
The following points must be remembered when calculating the comparative costs of prophylaxis.
y C ost of prophylaxis should include the resource and drug costs of prophylaxis and the costs of increased 
prevalence of antibiotic resistance from antibiotic exposure.
y Calculations are highly sensitive to the costs of the particular antibiotic used for the prophylaxis.
y T he minimal effective dose should be used. Increasing the number of doses above this minimum level 
of effectiveness adds to cost without improving effectiveness.
y The method of administration may influence the cost of prophylaxis.194
y Inappropriate or incorrect use of antibiotic prophylaxis may have adverse cost implications.195,196
8.3 ImPlEmENTATIoN
Guideline implementation should be supported by a programme of continuing education, evaluation of 
4
current literature and regular examination of antibiotic susceptibility patterns in local NHS boards.197
The following factors have been shown to increase the effectiveness of implementation strategies.
y L ocal guidelines or protocols should be developed by a multidisciplinary group of all stakeholders (for 
example, surgeons, anaesthetists, speciality pharmacists, microbiologists, infection control specialists).198-201
y Local guidelines or protocols should be flexible to allow for clinical judgement.199 4
y Local guidelines or protocols should be clear and easy to follow.202
y R egular audit, locally owned by stakeholders, with feedback of non-adherence to local guideline (including 
specific clinician feedback).203 This should be actively discussed and acted upon on a regular basis.
y A ctive involvement and support from local senior staff or respected opinion leaders for the implementation 
strategy programme.204, 205
Recommended indications for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis are available from the SIGN website as surgery 
specific Quick Reference Guides. These can be annotated for use as local implementation tools.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery 8 • Implementing the guideline
8.3.1 IMPLEMENTATIoN TooLS FoR PREvENTING INAPPRoPRIATE PRESCRIBING
Introduction of special forms for prescribing perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis has been shown to 
reduce inappropriate prescribing from 64% to 21%.140 
4
Use of specific antibiotic order forms206 reduced inappropriate prescribing and was one of the recommendations 
of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).207,208
Tools described include:
y standardised perioperative antibiotic prescribing forms200,209,210
y integrated dispensing processes198, 200 4
y personalised antibiotic kits211,212
y reminders204
y automated alerts for re-dosing during prolonged procedures.212
Prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis in the single dose section of drug prescription forms is also associated 3
with a lower proportion of inappropriate additional dosage.213
 D I nappropriate prolongation of surgical prophylaxis can be reduced by use of specific prescribing 
forms for surgical prophylaxis, or recording of prophylaxis in single dose sections of existing drug 
prescription charts.
8.4 AuDITING CuRRENT PRACTICE
8.4.1 DoCUMENTATIoN
  All aspects of antibiotic prophylaxis, for example, where prophylaxis is not given when recommended, 
should be clearly recorded in the case records.
  Locally agreed protocols should clearly indicate where to document antibiotic prophylaxis in the patient 
records (for example, the ‘once only’ section of the drug chart, integrated care pathway or anaesthetic 
chart).
8.4.2 MINIMUM DATA SET FoR AUDIT oF SURGICAL ANTIBIoTIC PRoPHYLAxIS
A minimum data set to document the administration of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is summarised below.
- Date
- operation performed
- Classification of operation (clean/clean-contaminated/contaminated)
- Elective or emergency
- Patient weight (especially children)
- Any previous adverse reactions/allergies to antibiotics
-  Justification for prophylaxis (eg, evidence of a high risk of SSI) if given for an operation where prophylaxis 
is not routinely indicated 
- Justification for not giving prophylaxis (eg, procedure not in local guideline, patient on antibiotic treatment)
- Time of antibiotic administration
- Name of antibiotic
- Dosage of antibiotic
- Route of administration
- Time of surgical incision

- Second dosage given?
- Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis indicated?
- Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis given?
- Antibiotic prophylaxis continued for >24 hrs
- Documentation recorded  appropriately (in correct place, clarity)
- Name of anaesthetist
- Name of surgeon
 Record the minimum data set to facilitate audit of the appropriateness of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.
The majority of successful implementation strategies used short–term audits and active feedback to 3 
stakeholders.198,200,205,211 4
A good quality systematic review of non-analytical studies showed that statistical process control can help 
change management and improve healthcare processes.214
An example of statistical process control is the PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) cycle. Measurement of 
compliance (for example, using run and control charts) to give timely feedback to healthcare professionals 
is recommended by the Scottish Patient Safety Programme (www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org/
our_work/patient_safety/spsp.aspx) to achieve effective, embedded change. Further information on PDSA 
is available from NHSScotland Clinical Governance (www.clinicalgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/section2/pdsa.asp).
 D Short period audits held at regular intervals, with stakeholder feedback, are recommended.
 The use of statistical process control to achieve effective embedded change should be considered.
In the UK, the national mandatory surveillance of SSI dataset includes data items on surgical antibiotic 
prophylaxis, which indicate compliance with the SIGN guideline. The Surgical Site Infection Surveillance 
Protocol and Resource Pack is available from the SSHAIP website (www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/haiic/sshaip/
guidelinedetail.aspx?id=31554).
8.4.3 CoRE INDICAToRS FoR AUDIT
Process measures:
y Was prophylaxis given for an operation included in local guidelines?
y I f prophylaxis was given for an operation not included in local guidelines, was a clinical justification for 
prophylaxis recorded in the case notes?
y Was the first dosage of prophylaxis given within 60 minutes of the start of surgery?
y Were the choice, dosage and route of administration consistent with local guidelines for that procedure?
y Was the prescription written in the ‘once-only’ section of the drug prescription chart?
y Was the duration of prophylaxis greater then 24 hours?

procedures.
y R ate of SSIs occurring postoperatively in patients who receive inappropriate prophylaxis (as defined 
in the guideline) compared with rate of this infection in patients who receive appropriate prophylaxis,

 For audit, surgical site infections should be described following the CDC criteria (see Annex 2).
8.4.4 AUDIT oF ANTIMICRoBIAL PRESCRIBING
A point prevalence survey of antimicrobial prescribing performed in 10 Scottish hospitals used the Glasgow 
Antimicrobial Audit Tool (GAAT). Regional differences were seen and data collected may usefully inform local 
and national audit and support prescribing initiatives.215

9 The evidence base
9.1 SySTEmATIC lITERATuRE REVIEW
The evidence base for this guideline was synthesised in accordance with SIGN methodology. A systematic 
review of the literature was carried out using an explicit search strategy devised by a SIGN Evidence and 
Information Scientist. Databases searched include Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and the Cochrane Library. For 
most searches the year range covered was 2001-2007. Internet searches were carried out on various websites 
including the US National Guidelines Clearinghouse. The Medline version of the main search strategies 
can be found on the SIGN website, in the section covering supporting material. The main searches were 
supplemented by material identified by individual members of the development group.
9.1.1 LITERATURE SEARCH FoR ECoNoMIC ISSUES
A SIGN Information officer conducted a literature search of the NHS Economics Evaluations Database (NEED) 
for studies that highlighted economic issues related to antibiotic prophylaxis.
9.1.2 LITERATURE SEARCH FoR PATIENT ISSUES
At the start of the guideline development process, a SIGN Evidence and Information Scientist conducted 
a literature search for qualitative and quantitative studies that addressed patient issues of relevance to 
antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery. Databases searched include Medline, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFo, and 
the results were summarised and presented to the guideline development group. A copy of the Medline 
version of the patient search strategy is available on the SIGN website.
9.2 RECommENDATIoNS foR RESEARCH

9.2.2 SURGICAL ANTIBIoTIC PRoPHYLAxIS IN CHILDREN
Further research into the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for all surgical interventions in children, in the 
form of clinical trials, particularly multicentre trials, is recommended.
Research underpinning the following factors needs to be addressed
y C hoice of antibiotic and duration of prophylaxis, as therapy may be carried on for longer in children than 
studies in adults would recommend.
y  Factors such as host responses, antibiotic pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics may be different enough 
to have a separate policy.
y Rates of SSIs and their relation to practice, including prophylaxis.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
9.2.3 PRINCIPLES oF ANTIBIoTIC PRoPHYLAxIS
Further research is required to address areas where there is insufficient evidence to make recommendations 
or support current clinical practice. The following areas have been identified as especially important. Research 
into antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent SSI should use the CDC definitions (see Annexes 2 and 3).
y The pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and duration of antibiotic prophylaxis.
y The risks of C. diff associated diarrhoea.
y The preoperative implications of MRSA and other multiresistant organisms.
y The harms and benefits of administering prophylactic antibiotics post-cord clamp.

10.2.1 PATIENT INvoLvEMENT
In addition to the identification of relevant patient issues from a broad literature search, SIGN involves 
patients and carers throughout the guideline development process in several ways. SIGN recruits a minimum 
of two patient representatives to guideline development groups by inviting nominations from the relevant 
‘umbrella’, national and/or local patient focused organisations in Scotland. Where organisations are unable 
to nominate, patient representatives are sought via other means, for example, from consultation with health 
board public involvement staff.
Further patient and public participation in guideline development was achieved by involving patients, 
carers and voluntary organisation representatives at the National open Meeting (see section 10.3.1). Patient 
representatives were invited to take part in the peer review stage of the guideline and specific guidance for 
lay reviewers was circulated. Members of the SIGN patient network were also invited to comment on the 
draft guideline section on provision of information.

Annex 1
Key questions used to develop the guideline
The guideline is based on a series of structured key questions that, where possible, define the population 
concerned, the intervention (or diagnostic test, etc) under investigation, the comparison(s) used, and the 
outcomes used to measure the effectiveness of the interventions. These questions form the basis of the 
systematic literature search.
RISK FACToRS FoR SURGICAL SITE INFECTIoN
Key question See guideline section
1. What factors increase or decrease the risk of SSI in patients receiving antibiotic 3
prophylaxis? 
Consider:
• comorbidities such as diabetes, high BMI, disabilities
• immunosupression
• infection of site
• smoking
• perioperative hypothermia
• hypo-oxygenation
• early goal directed therapy.
BENEFITS AND RISKS oF ANTIBIoTIC PRoPHYLAxIS
Key question See guideline section
2. What is the likelihood that those people with a penicillin allergy are allergic to 4.2.1
cephalosporins?
What is the best definition of penicillin allergy?
3. What is the evidence that administering antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery 4.2.2-4.2.4
increases the risk of the following in the patient?
• anaphylaxis
• antibiotic-induced diarrhoea
•	 Clostridium difficile.
4. What is the evidence that administering antibiotic prophylaxis during surgery 4.2.5
increases antibiotic-resistant strains in the general population?

Annex 2
CDC criteria for defining a surgical site infection216
Superficial incisional SSI
Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation and infection involves only skin of subcutaneous tissue 
of the incision and at least one of the following:
1. purulent drainage, with or without laboratory confirmation, from the superficial incision
2. organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue from the superficial incision
3. at least one of the following signs or symptoms of infection:
• pain or tenderness
• localised swelling
• redness
• heat
and superficial incision deliberately opened by a surgeon, unless incision is culture-negative
4. diagnosis of superficial incisional SSI by the surgeon or attending physician.
Do not report the following conditions as SSI:
1. stitch abscess (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture penetration)
2. infection of an episiotomy or newborn circumcision site
3. infected burn wound
4. incisional SSI that extends into the fascial and muscle layers (see deep incisional SSI).
Note: Specific criteria are used for identifying infected episiotomy and circumcision sites and burn 
wounds.
Deep incisional SSI
Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within one year if 
implant is in place and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involves deep 
soft tissues (eg fascial and muscle layers) of the incision and at least one of the following:
1. purulent drainage from the deep incision but not from the organ/space component of the surgical 
site
2. a deep incision spontaneously dehisces or is deliberately opened by a surgeon when the patient has 
at least one of the following signs or symptoms:
• fever (>38°C)
• localised pain
• tenderness
unless site is culture-negative
3. an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the deep incision is found on direct examination, 
during reoperation, or by histopathological or radiological examination
4. diagnosis of deep incisional SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.
Notes: Report infection that involves both superficial and deep incision sites as deep incisional SSI. Report 
an organ/space SSI that drains through the incision as deep incisional SSI.
organ/space SSI
Infection occurs within 30 days after the operation if no implant is left in place or within one year if 
implant is in place and the infection appears to be related to the operation and infection involves any part 
of the anatomy (eg organs or spaces), other than the incision, which was opened or manipulated during 
an operation and at least one of the following:
1. purulent discharge from a drain that is placed through a stab wound into the organ/space
2. organisms isolated from an aseptically obtained culture of fluid or tissue in the organ/space
3. an abscess or other evidence of infection involving the organ/space that is found on direct 
examination, during reoperation, or by histopathologic or radiological examination
4. diagnosis of an organ/space SSI by a surgeon or attending physician.

80-90% of E. coli remain susceptible to second generation 
cephalosporins, beta-lactam drugs combined with a beta-

Insertion of a prosthesis, graft or shunt
Coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) 30-60% of S. aureus remain susceptible to flucloxacillin, 
Staphylococcus aureus macrolides or clindamycin, depending on the site of 
Diphtheroids insertion. Although two thirds of CNS are meticillin-
resistant, prophylaxis with beta-lactam antibiotics is still 
appropriate (see below).
mRSE, mRSA and glycopeptide prophylaxis
The increasing prevalence of meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) raises the issue of glycopeptide 
prophylaxis against MRSA and meticillin-resistant S. epidermis (MRSE) infections, usually when inserting 
large joint prostheses, vascular or cardiac grafts or shunts (see section 6.1.1).

Annex 6
Calculating the cost effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis
Three concepts are used in calculating the cost effectiveness of using antibiotic prophylaxis:
odds Ratio (oR)
The oR for a particular procedure is the number of wound infections occurring following prophylaxis 
divided by the number of wound infections occurring without prophylaxis. An odds ratio of 1 indicates 
no effect from prophylaxis.
Expected Baseline Risk
This is the number of wound infections occurring within the hospital for a particular surgical procedure 
each year, divided by the total number of times the surgical procedure is performed in the year. The 
expected baseline risk multiplied by 100 is the percentage risk of wound infection for that procedure.
Numbers Needed to Treat (NNT)
The NNT is the number of patients who must be given antibiotic prophylaxis in order to prevent one 
wound infection.
The method of calculating NNT from expected baseline risk and odds ratio is given in Cook and Sackett:193
1-[expected baseline risk x (1-odds ratio)]
NNT= 
1-(expected baseline risk) x expected baseline risk x (1-odds ratio)
The relationship between the baseline risk of wound infection and NNT is not a straight line. The NNT falls 
steeply as the risk of wound infection increases. The figure below shows the numbers of patients needed to 
be treated with antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent one wound infection in caesarean section surgery based 
on the results of a meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials.113, 218 The odds ratio of wound 
infectionwith prophylaxis is 0.35.
