                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most disabling and costly disorders affecting modern
                  society, and approximately 90% of patients are labelled as having non-specific LBP
                  (NSLBP). Several interventions for patients with NSLBP have been assessed in clinical
                  trials, but heterogeneous reporting of outcomes in these trials has hindered comparison
                  of results and performance of meta-analyses. Moreover, there is a risk of selective
                  outcome reporting bias. To address these issues, the development of a core outcome
                  set (COS) that should be measured in all clinical trials for a specific health condition
                  has been recommended. A standardized set of outcomes for LBP was proposed in 1998,
                  however, with evolution in COS development methodology, new instruments, interventions,
                  and understanding of measurement properties, it is appropriate to update that proposal.
                  This protocol describes the methods used in the initial step in developing a COS for
                  NSLBP, namely, establishing a core domain set that should be measured in all clinical
                  trials.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>An International Steering Committee including researchers, clinicians, and patient
                  representatives from four continents was formed to guide the development of this COS.
                  The approach of initiatives like Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET)
                  and Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) was followed. Participants were invited
                  to participate in a Delphi study aimed at generating a consensus-based core domain
                  set for NSLBP. A list of potential core domains was drafted and presented to the Delphi

               <h3>Background</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most disabling and costly disorders affecting modern
               society, and approximately 90% of patients are labelled as having non-specific LBP
               (NSLBP). Several interventions for patients with NSLBP have been assessed in clinical
               trials, but heterogeneous reporting of outcomes in these trials has hindered comparison
               of results and performance of meta-analyses. Moreover, there is a risk of selective
               outcome reporting bias. To address these issues, the development of a core outcome
               set (COS) that should be measured in all clinical trials for a specific health condition
               has been recommended. A standardized set of outcomes for LBP was proposed in 1998,
               however, with evolution in COS development methodology, new instruments, interventions,
               and understanding of measurement properties, it is appropriate to update that proposal.
               This protocol describes the methods used in the initial step in developing a COS for
               NSLBP, namely, establishing a core domain set that should be measured in all clinical
               trials.

            <p>An International Steering Committee including researchers, clinicians, and patient
               representatives from four continents was formed to guide the development of this COS.
               The approach of initiatives like Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET)
               and Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) was followed. Participants were invited
               to participate in a Delphi study aimed at generating a consensus-based core domain
               set for NSLBP. A list of potential core domains was drafted and presented to the Delphi
               participants who were asked to judge which domains were core. Participant suggestions
               about overlap, aggregation, or addition of potential core domains were addressed during
               the study. The patients’ responses were isolated to assess whether there was substantial
               disagreement with the rest of the Delphi panel. 
               <i>A priori</i> thresholds for consensus were established before each Delphi round. All participants’

      </div>
      <p>Low back pain (LBP) is the leading global contributor to years lived with disability
         (YLDs) and the sixth global contributor to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)

            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>

         society 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. Approximately 90% of patients with LBP are labelled as having non-specific LBP (NSLBP),
         a diagnosis based on exclusion of a specific cause or pathology 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. A wide range of health interventions for patients with NSLBP has been evaluated

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. The results of clinical trials addressing similar interventions are often summarized
         in systematic reviews 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>, but authors of these reviews have reported that outcomes are inconsistently measured
         and reported across trials 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. This limits ability to compare findings between studies or pool data for formal
         meta-analyses. Furthermore, inconsistency can be the result of selective outcome reporting
         bias (selective reporting of favourable outcomes) which can strongly affect the conclusions
         of systematic reviews

      <p>To reduce heterogeneity in outcomes measured across clinical trials, development of
         core outcome sets (COSs) in specific health conditions has been advocated 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. A COS is an agreed minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. A COS might increase reporting of important outcomes, reduce the risk of selective
         outcome reporting, and increase the feasibility of conducting meta-analyses 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. The existence of a COS also ensures that authors of clinical trials report on outcomes
         that are relevant for all stakeholders 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. Editors of Cochrane Review Groups have agreed that the availability of COSs would

      <p>In 1998, following an expert panel discussion held at the second international LBP
         Forum (The Hague, Netherlands), a proposal for a standardized set of outcomes in LBP
         clinical research was published 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>. Five domains were proposed for measurement (pain symptoms, back-related function,
         generic wellbeing, disability social role, and satisfaction with care) and specific
         measurement instruments were recommended for each domain 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>. This proposal has been highly cited and widely adopted over the years. However,
         a workshop discussion among LBP researchers during the 2012 twelfth LBP Forum (Odense,
         Denmark) underlined the wish to update the existing recommendations considering recent
         advancements in the fields of COS development and clinimetrics 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>. There were two primary reasons: to explore if relevant domains were missing, and
         to critically appraise the recommended measurement instruments in light of a large
         body of newer data on measurement properties of instruments for LBP 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         the instruments that should be used to assess the domains (‘how’ to measure, the ‘core

      <p>An International Steering Committee was formed to initiate and support the development
         of this COS. Members of the Steering Committee were chosen to represent various disciplines,
         geographical areas, and types of expertise. As a result, the Steering Committee includes
         18 members among whom: 14 are researchers from different disciplines with ample experience
         in LBP clinical research (RD, CL, RB, LC, NF, MG, BK, FK, CM, AP, WP, DT, MvT, RO),
         three are experts in consensus-based research procedures (CT, MB, DT), six are authors
         of several publications in the field of clinimetrics (CT, RB, LC, FK, MG, RO), six
         are healthcare providers involved in the management of patients with LBP (MB, RB,
         LC, FK, AP, WP), and two are patient representatives (TC, MS). The members represent
         Europe, Australia, and North and South America.
      </p>
      <p>The project team consisted of one investigator (AC), appointed to coordinate the day-to-day
         management of the project, and three members of the Steering Committee working at
         the same institution (CT, MB, RO). During face-to-face meetings, the project team
         established the methodology and addressed key aspects. The other members of the Steering
         Committee were contacted by email regarding critical decisions; when more than half
         of the members agreed on a decision, this was followed unless substantial and convincing
         arguments were raised by one or more members in disagreement. Definitions of key concepts

            <h3>Scope of this core outcome set</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The Steering Committee recommended that this COS should apply to measuring efficacy
            or effectiveness of health interventions in clinical trials for patients with NSLBP,
            defined as ‘low back pain not attributable to a recognizable, known specific pathology
            (eg infection, tumour, fracture, axial spondyloarthritis)’ 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
            </span>. All interventions for NSLBP are targeted by this COS, regardless of type, setting,
            or mode of administration. In line with COMET definition 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
            </span>, this does not imply that primary outcomes of a clinical trial should always be those
            of the COS or that outcome measures should be restricted to the domains of the COS.
            However, domains of this COS should be considered for inclusion in all clinical trials
            on NSLBP, besides the measurement of trial-specific domains. There is no intent that
            this COS should be considered as a requirement for regulatory approval of drugs or
            devices, or that an intervention should demonstrate benefits on all COS measures to
            be judged efficacious or effective.
         </p>
         <p>Other goals of this COS are to provide a recommendation on reporting of adverse events
            (AEs) in clinical trials on NSLBP and to identify contextual factors (such as confounders
            and effect modifiers) that should be measured alongside core domains (Table 
            <span tagx="tblr">1</span>). However, it is out of our scope to reach consensus on contextual factors that should
            be measured and reported in all clinical trials. For measurement and reporting of
            contextual factors, we refer to the prominent work of the National Institutes of Health
            (NIH) Task Force that recently published a report about minimum baseline measures
            for clinical studies on chronic LBP 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

            <h3>Identification of existing knowledge</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The Steering Committee identified initiatives that could potentially overlap with
            this study at an early stage of this project. None of these initiatives had the same
            scope as this COS. In this subsection, we report where partial conceptual overlap
            between this COS and the other initiatives could lie:
         </p>
         <p>1. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials
            (IMMPACT) has developed a consensus-based set of outcome domains and measurement instruments
            for clinical trials on chronic pain 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">22</span>
               <span tagx="abbr">23</span>
            </span>. IMMPACT leaves ample space for the definition of more specialized COSs for some
            specific subgroups of patients with pain, such as this COS which focuses only on patients
            with NSLBP.
         </p>
         <p>2. A core set for LBP based on the International Classification of Functioning (ICF)
            was developed by linking the health issues associated with LBP to the categories of
            the ICF framework 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">24</span>
            </span>. These core sets are available for use in clinical studies or to guide assessment
            of patients with LBP, but they do not have a specific focus on the measurement of
            outcomes in clinical trials.
         </p>
         <p>3. The recent NIH Task Force recommended baseline research standards for clinical
            studies on chronic LBP (CLBP) 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
            </span>. These recommendations are proposed to describe, stratify, and compare reports on
            patients with chronic LBP, but they are not prescriptive for the reporting of core
            outcomes in clinical trials.
         </p>
         <p>4. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) has recently
            developed a standardized set of outcomes for LBP 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">25</span>
            </span>. The ICHOM initiative aims at targeting ‘all providers around the world’ and all
            LBP disorders. This suggests a rather broad scope focused on the provision of healthcare,
            rather than a specific focus on core outcomes for all health interventions assessed
            in clinical trials for NSLBP.

            <h3>Stakeholder involvement</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Different stakeholders can be involved in the development of a COS: researchers, healthcare
            providers, patients, managers, government agencies, and industry representatives 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
            </span>. The involvement of multiple stakeholders in the consensus process for a COS is strongly
            recommended by COS methodologists 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
               <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
               <span tagx="abbr">26</span>
            </span>. For this COS, the Steering Committee decided to focus on four groups of stakeholders:
         </p>
         <p>1. Healthcare researchers: these are professionals working in all fields of clinical
            research relevant for NSLBP (such as orthopaedics, physiotherapy, psychology, chiropractic,
            anaesthesiology, rheumatology, physical medicine, and rehabilitation), methodologists,
            or statisticians who currently work only as researchers. All researchers involved
            in this project should be authors of published scientific articles on clinical research
            for LBP.
         </p>
         <p>2. Healthcare providers: these are professionals from different disciplines who have
            clinical experience in the management of patients with NSLBP.
         </p>
         <p>3. Professionals who work both as healthcare researchers and providers: a separate
            category is made for these professionals because they might bring a perspective on
            core outcomes that may differ from that of people who perform only one of the two
            jobs.
         </p>
         <p>4. Patients: this group is composed of people who have or have had NSLBP, and who
            sought healthcare for their NSLBP. Previous research has shown that it is limiting
            not to include patients in the development of a COS 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
            </span>. Patients have the perspective of living with the health condition and this may substantially
            differ from those of researchers and providers.
         </p>
         <p>The decision to focus on these groups of stakeholders was based on practical considerations
            related to the resources of time and money available for the project. Members of the
            Steering Committee represented all these stakeholder groups, and representatives of
            each were invited to participate in the Delphi study used to reach consensus on this
            core domain set.

            <h3>A conceptual framework</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A comprehensive framework of health can be beneficial in developing a COS, favouring
            the content validity of the end product. A recent review identified five conceptual
            frameworks that could be relevant for COSs development 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
            </span>. However, only the five Ds (discomfort, disability, drug toxicity, dollar cost, and
            death) and the ICF framework have been used to develop COSs in different health areas,
            and they cover somewhat different areas of outcome 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
            </span>. The OMERACT initiative has developed a new framework that aims at including all
            key aspects of a health condition to ensure comprehensiveness of COSs 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span>.
         </p>
         <p>The OMERACT Filter 2.0 framework was created to broaden the ICF framework and combine
            it with Wilson and Cleary’s model of health-related quality of life 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">28</span>
            </span>. The framework is subdivided into core areas (Table 
            <span tagx="tblr">1</span>) that encompass the complete content of what is measurable in a clinical trial, including
            both patient-centred and intervention-specific information. It includes three core
            areas that describe the ‘impact of health conditions’ (‘death’, ‘life impact’, and
            ‘resource use and economic impact’) and one core area that describes ‘pathophysiological
            manifestations’. An explanation of the four core areas of the OMERACT framework is
            presented in Table 
            <span tagx="tblr">2</span>. OMERACT recommends the inclusion of at least one domain from each core area in every
            COS 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span>. However, our Steering Committee decided that, initially, no requirements related
            to the core areas should be applied to the domains that may become part of this core
            domain set. Regarding ‘death’, it was noted that this is a mandatory reporting requirement
            for all clinical trials, but a rare event in NSLBP. Regarding ‘pathophysiological
            manifestations’, it was noted that they might be out of the scope of some clinical
            trials, given that NSLBP is defined by its lack of known pathophysiology. The Delphi
            study will be used to evaluate whether substantial and convincing arguments generate
            further discussion on this within the Steering Committee. The OMERACT Filter 2.0 framework
            was used by the Steering Committee to help the development of a list of potential
            core domains and for discussion during the Delphi study.

            <p>We decided that at least 80 experts were required to participate in each round of
               the Delphi. Based on previous experience with Delphi studies 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
               </span>, we calculated a minimum response rate of 40% that led to the conclusion that at
               least 200 people had to be invited in the first round. A list of researchers who had
               extensively published on LBP was compiled using an approach aimed at minimizing selection
               bias. First, a search in Web of Science was performed to identify authors of at least
               25 publications on LBP over the last 10 years (between 2003 and 2013). Those who were
               authors of at least two clinical trials or one systematic review of clinical trials
               on NSLBP were considered eligible. One reviewer (AC) screened titles and abstracts
               of publications of each author against the inclusion criteria. Only researchers with
               a retrievable email address were selected for invitation to the Delphi procedure.
               To ensure that notable researchers were not excluded from this list, convenience sampling
               was added to the systematic search. Members of the Steering Committee were asked to
               indicate the names of five researchers from different disciplines that should absolutely
               be included in this consensus exercise. Names recommended by the Steering Committee
               were added to the existing list.
            </p>
            <p>Healthcare providers for the Delphi panel were recruited through convenience sampling.
               Each member of the Steering Committee was asked to identify a minimum of 10 clinicians
               from different disciplines who had clinical experience in managing patients with NSLBP.
            </p>
            <p>Patients were also recruited through convenience sampling. Inclusion criteria for
               patients were: present or past history of NSLBP, attendance of healthcare for their
               back complaint, and fluent understanding of written English. Three members of the
               Steering Committee from different geographical locations (CL, MS, and RO) were asked
               to identify providers who could have direct contact to patients. Patients identified
               by these providers were contacted by email, provided further information about the
               study, and invited to participate. Those who agreed were sent an informative document
               giving explanations of technical terms that could be encountered during the questionnaires.
               Those who confirmed their interest were invited to take part in the Delphi study.
            </p>
            <p>All members of the Steering Committee were also invited to take part in the Delphi
               study. This implies that they expressed their opinion twice regarding aspects discussed
               previously within the Steering Committee and then in the Delphi study (for example,
               regarding AEs). It was decided not to exclude their opinion from the Delphi results,
               where responses remained anonymous and could be seen by the whole panel. We considered
               that this fact could outweigh the disadvantage of having their opinion counting twice
               for some issues. The final list of selected panellists was known only to the project
               team member who compiled it (AC), and was not shared with the Steering Committee or
               any other panellist.

               <h4>Generation of a list of potential core domains</h4>
            </div>
            <p>To make a list of (sub)domains that are routinely used as outcomes in efficacy or
               effectiveness trials for NSLBP, a search was performed of five recent Cochrane systematic

               </span> (Oosterhuis T 
               <i>et al.</i> unpublished data). This first list of domains was subsequently enriched by adding
               (sub)domains included in the comprehensive ICF core set for LBP 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">24</span>

                  <span tagx="abbr">33</span>
               </span>. The comprehensive ICF core set and the conceptual model on the burden of LBP were
               adopted in this developmental phase because they both considered the patients’ perspective
               
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">

               </span>. Subdomains that seemed to cover the same domain were grouped together to make a
               first draft list of domains (version one) where domains were classified into one of
               the core areas included in the OMERACT framework (Table 
               <span tagx="tblr">2</span>). To find appropriate terms and definitions for each domain, we consulted the ICF

               published papers.
            </p>
            <p>Different features of the version one list of domains were discussed among the project
               team. A second literature search based on points of discussion was conducted and led
               to the development of the version two list. Feedback for version two was invited from
               other members of the Steering Committee, who were asked to provide critical comments
               on each domain. The members were also asked to indicate if there were important missing
               potential core domains and to indicate if they thought that certain domains were too
               broad or should be aggregated. The project team adjusted version two according to
               this input and formulated the final list of potential core domains (version three)
               that was used during the Delphi study.

            <h3>Delphi procedure</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A minimum of two Delphi rounds (including both closed and open-ended questions) was
            planned 
            <i>a priori</i>. Considering that it is not feasible to weight responses from different stakeholder
            groups, all panel members were invited to participate, irrespective of the number
            from each stakeholder group. Panel members were invited to participate in each round
            of the Delphi study, unless they explicitly indicated during the study that they did
            not wish to receive further invitations.
         </p>
         <p>The project team designed the Delphi questionnaires, sent invitations and reminders
            to panel members, analysed the responses, and formulated the feedback reports. Questionnaires
            used during the whole Delphi procedure were pilot-tested by three members of the project
            team (CT, MB, RO) and by one or two selected panellists. For this Delphi study, the
            online software SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, Palo Alto, United States) was used and
            invitations for participation were sent by email. Each round was online for three
            or four weeks and reminder emails were sent approximately every seven days after the
            initial invitation. Recommendations of a group of COS methodologists for the use of
            the Delphi method were followed in this study 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">

               <h4>Delphi round one</h4>
            </div>
            <p>In the first round, participants were initially given information about the study
               and about the formulation of the questionnaire. They completed questions about their
               educational and professional background, their experience with clinical research relevant
               for NSLBP, and whether they were invited to participate as patients. The version three
               list of potential core domains, subdivided into core areas, was used to rate their
               importance. In the survey, the order of core areas and the order of domains within
               core areas were randomized. Panel members were asked to indicate if each domain was
               important enough to be included in this core domain set; response options were ‘Yes’,
               ‘No’ and ‘Unsure/I do not know’. Participants were strongly encouraged to provide
               arguments for their choices and to suggest modifications of definitions or wording
               of the domains. Participants were then asked to indicate if they considered that there
               was a large conceptual overlap between some domains, to suggest whether some domains
               had be aggregated, and to suggest potential core domains not included in the list.
               They were also asked to indicate what they would consider to be an ideal number of
               domains for this COS.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, participants were asked to assess whether they agreed on a specific approach
               for the reporting of AEs. This approach highlighted that AEs cannot be considered
               as one of the potential core domains because they could affect multiple core areas
               and domains. Therefore, only AEs occurring outside of core domains could be listed
               specifically as AEs, because those occurring within a defined core domain would be
               summarized within the results for that domain. Panellists were asked to provide reasons
               for their responses.
            </p>
            <p>The responses of round one were analysed and collated in the feedback report. Frequencies
               for the response options on the importance of domains were calculated for the whole
               panel. Responses to open questions were checked to evaluate if substantial arguments
               emerged against the overall trend of frequencies. Responses of the patients’ group
               were highlighted and analysed separately to assess if they differed from the other
               panel responses.
            </p>
            <p>The project team established 
               <i>a priori</i> that domains for which more than 60% of the responders chose the response option
               ‘No’ and less than 20% chose the response option ‘Yes’ would be dropped from the list
               of potential core domains. The project team considered the suggestions for the aggregation
               of certain domains and the strength of the arguments. Suggested missing core domains
               were added to the list for the next round. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize
               responses on the ideal number of domains and on the reporting of AEs.

               <h4>Delphi round two</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The feedback report was provided to the panel members along with the second round
               of the survey. A proposal was presented for deleting domains that did not have at
               least 67% of first round respondents in favour or unsure about inclusion in the core
               domain set. Other proposals were driven by comments of the first round and concerned
               exclusion, aggregation, or retention of other potential core domains. For example,
               if in round one several comments were made about the breadth of one domain covering
               other more specific domains, a proposal was made to erase this broad domain. Panellists
               were asked to indicate whether or not they agreed with all the proposals and 
               <i>a priori</i> consensus was set at 67% respondent agreement. Panellists were also asked to judge
               if missing core domains suggested in the first round were important enough to be included
               in the list. Response options were the same as the first round and these domains were
               added to the list of potential core domains if 67% of respondents were in favour or
               unsure of their inclusion.
            </p>
            <p>Upon completion of the second round, responses were analysed and combined in the feedback
               report. As in the first round, patients’ responses were analysed separately to assess
               if they had different opinions from the rest of the panel. Results were discussed
               by the project team, which assessed whether substantial arguments emerged against
               the overall consensus obtained with quantitative answers.

               <h4>Delphi round three</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The feedback report of the second round was presented to all participants invited
               to the third round. Based on previous results, the potential core domains left in
               the list were presented in the third round to ask if each domain was indeed core.
               Response options were the same as the first round and participants were given the
               opportunity to provide arguments for their choices.
            </p>
            <p>Frequencies for the response options were calculated for the whole panel and for each
               of the four stakeholder groups separately to evaluate if discrepancies existed between
               the groups. Reasons for all choices were checked to ensure that no convincing arguments
               were raised against the dominating group response. 
               <i>A priori</i> consensus was set at 67% of the panel agreeing that a domain was core, with domains
               reaching this threshold to be included in this COS. If there were clear discrepancies
               between stakeholder groups or controversial arguments emerged, the results were presented
               to the Steering Committee that made final decisions.

      <p>Development of a COS is an iterative approach that includes, firstly, determination

         of a consensus-based core domain set for clinical trials of health interventions for
         NSLBP. It forms the first step in updating the proposal of standardized measurement
         in LBP made in 1998 by Deyo
