                           <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2> 
                        </div> 
                        <p>The System-on-a-package (SOP) concept is being widely deployed as the key solution
                           for low-cost multi-functional electronic systems. Especially, for the wired and wireless
                           communication applications, SOP approach is more appropriate than System-on-a-Chip
                           (SOC), because the communication modules require critical passive components that
                           cannot be realized by IC process.<a id="note-ref_1a"></a> <a id="note-ref_2a"></a> <a id="note-ref_3a"></a> The "Intelligent Network Communicator (INC)" testbed project is the symbolic showcase
                           of SOP concept and has been driven by NSF Packaging Research Center (PRC) in Georgia
                           Tech since 2001 [<a href="#ref_1">1</a>] [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>] [<a href="#ref_3">3</a>]. The goals and objectives of the INC System testbed were to explore new systems
                           architectures that can be enabled by SOP technologies. All the available technologies
                           related to micro-system development, which includes design, material, fabrication
                           and test, are being adopted and verified through the process of building INC system
                           hardware. The INC is composed of three functional sub-blocks: the digital, analog
                           and optical blocks. The function of the INC is to transmit and receive the high-speed
                           digital signals and RF signals concurrently over the optical channel. The multi-Gbps
                           digital signal generated at the digital block is combined with the RF signal at the
                           analog block. The combined signal is optically modulated and transferred through the
                           embedded optical waveguide. The light wave signal is down converted to the electrical
                           domain again and the electrical domain mixed signal is separated to the digital and
                           RF signal by the embedded multilayered mixed signal divider System specifications
                           of each of the blocks has been defined to deal with their major barriers while incorporating
                           with other blocks for single functional goal.
                        </p> 
                        <p>The system has been rigorously tested at the each of subsystem group, RF, digital
                           and optical group in PRC. After verifying the system at the subsystem level, the overall
                           system test has been performed. The test results clearly show that the measurement
                           results meet the target specifications.

                           </div>  
                        </div> 
                        <p>The proposed INC system configuration is shown in <a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>. At the digital block, a multigigabit pseudo random digital bit sequence is generated
                           by using FPGA and compared with the received signal after passing the analog and optical
                           blocks. The multi-channel signals from FPGA (Virtex 50E, Xlinx) are converted into
                           serial data stream by the transceiver IC (TLK 2701, TI), which also includes MUX,
                           DMUX, and are fed to the analog block. The FPGA at the receiver stage compares the
                           known input data bit stream and the recovered data from the receiver to evaluate the
                           system performance. An FPGA is programmed to generate sixteen parallel data channel
                           (150Mbs/c/s) which are taken by a MUX used to convert the parallel data to a 2.488
                           Gbs/s serial signal. This signal is the input of RF section, which is integrated into
                           a same board. To reduce the interference from the digital part, a separated ground
                           and power were designed. A co-planar waveguide and matching network was used for RF
                           input and conversion of differential signal to single-ended signal.
                        </p> 
                        <p>At the analog block, two narrowband RF signals, which are generated by the Electronic
                           Signal Generator for 802.1la/b wireless LAN signal and by the voltage controlled oscillator
                           for 5?6 GHz range of single tone signal are being combined with the multi-Gbps digital
                           data stream from the digital block. The high frequency component of the digital signal
                           is truncated by the embedded low pass filter before combining. A mixed signal combiner
                           for combining digital and RF signal is designed utilizing the multilayer organic packaging
                           technology. A voltage controlled oscillator IC is specially developed in Mesfet process.
                           The VCO is utilizing an embedded high-Q inductor built in the substrate to reduce
                           the phase noise of the IC. The embedded inductor is optimized to get the best performance
                           at 5GHz. The combined electrical signal is fed to the input of the optical modulator.
                        </p> 
                        <p>At the optical block, the RF and digital signals are modulated to the optical domain
                           by one Mach-Zehnder modulator and a VCSEL direct modulation scheme, whose wavelengths
                           are 1550nm and 870nm, respectively. The optical signal is initially transmitted through
                           one multimode optical fiber channel and coupled into the embedded optical waveguide
                           by the Butt coupling method. In order to integrate long (5 to 15 cm) polymer waveguides
                           on flexible FR-4 boards that contain two metal layers separated by a low temperature
                           insulating polymer layer, critical technical issues, which include board flexibility,
                           long range board non planarity and short range roughness, and coefficient of thermal
                           expansion (CTE) matching, have to be addressed.
                        </p> 
                        <p>At the receiver end, the electrical signal is obtained by the photo detector. The
                           electrical signal is amplified using TIA and separated by an embedded mixed signal
                           splitter, which is identical with the combiner. The recovered digital signal is differentiated
                           to separate channels and transmitted to another FPGA for the purpose of comparing
                           with the transmitted signal.

                        <p>The entire development flow including design, fabrication and test is shown in <a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>. The INC testbed was fabricated using the PRC baseline process which had been previously
                           characterized through extensive digital and RF design and fabrication test vehicles.
                           The substrates utilized the thin-film build-up microvia technology on high Tg organic
                           based substrates. This photovia dielectric has a dielectric constant 3.4 and a loss
                           of 0.015 at 1 GHz. The build-up structure consisted of three metal layers with two
                           staggered photovia layers. The optical waveguides were fabricated on top of the dielectric
                           layer using photoimageable polysiloxane materials for planarization, bottom cladding,
                           waveguide core, and top cladding layers. The ground rules used for the testbed were

                        </div> 
                        <p>The digital block is composed of the transmitting and the receiving parts. They work
                           as a pre- and after-processing for the communication system. The layout had to be
                           considered carefully to reduce the interference from each othe r. Moreover, there
                           were several power levels and different ground reference plane requirements in both
                           digital and RF block. In this testbed the following techniques were used: 1) <i>Embedded decoupling capacitors</i>. The embedded capacitors were supposed to have better properties than the discrete
                           ones with low parasitic inductance and resistance. In case the fabrication of the
                           embedded capacitors failed, forty-two discrete decoupling capacitors were designed.
                           2) <i>Split power and ground planes</i>. There were three voltage levels: 3.3 V, 2.5 V and 1.8 V. A split power plane was
                           used in the testbed. To minimize the coupling though a shared power supply, three
                           ferrite beads were used. The split ground plane occupies the second and third metal
                           layers underneath the signal layer serving digital and RF part respectively. 3) One
                           <i>50 Ohm zigzag microstrip line</i> was designed with small delay difference between those lines for a high speed transmission.
                        </p> 
                        <p>Various time-domain waveforms were measured and the results are shown in <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a> It is obvious that the waveform at speed of 3.2 Gbps is clear, which means the noise
                           suppression was successful. he outputs of the FPGA verify that the impedance of the
                           transmission line matches well.

                        <p>The analog block of the INC system focuses on the study of mixed signal architectures,
                           which can provide enhanced bandwidth, frequency and data rates in real time. The goal
                           is to combine high-speed broadband digital signals up to 10Gbps and RF carriers in
                           the frequency range between 5?14 GHz. Various passive and active components for the
                           realization of efficient RF-digital interfaces have been implemented and evaluated,
                           and design rules are to be derived for various frequency ranges.
                        </p> 
                        <p>Numerous RF passives, that have been designed and developed in RF testbed, have been
                           integrated in the INC system. A mixed signal combiner has been developed using PRC's
                           multilayered organic package. The combiner has excellent isolation between digital
                           and RF port and shows only ?1dB of insertion loss at 5.8GHz.<a id="note-ref_4a"></a> Linear phase low-pass filter has been developed as a part of the mixed signal combiner

                           for 5.8GHz operation. The customary designed cross-coupled VCO has been fabricated
                           using commercial based MESFET process without inductors. The bare die IC is wire-bonded
                           to the two embedded inductors which are built on the organic substrate. It is clear
                           that the high-Q inductor is essential for a significantly reduced phase noise of the
                           VCO.<a id="note-ref_2b"></a> The VCO module used for INC testbed shows the phase noise of ?110 dBc @ 6MHz offset

                        <p>The fully functional INC system testbed has been fabricated and demonstrated. The
                           final version of INC system has been shown in <a href="#fig_7">fig. 7</a>. The configuration and a photo of system test setup are shown in flg. 8. Two identical
                           INC boards were used for the demonstration, one for showing digital-RF blocks and
                           the other one for optical block, which requires more stable setup for the accurate
                           aligning the embedded waveguide and optical fiber. Even though the two boards were
                           spatially separated, they were functionally connected by RF and optical cables and
                           connectors. The optical table has been used to minimize vibration when embedded optical
                           waveguides are coupled to optical fibers. The EDFA has been used to compensate for
                           the high total insertion loss of the on-board waveguides. The optical signal goes
                           through a second EDFA before arriving at the receiving end of the system. Photo of

                        <p>The photo of the setup of the mixed Digital-Analog block is shown in <a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>. Two different optical paths have been demonstrated at the same time, one for using
                           Mach-Zehnder modulator with the embedded waveguide and the other one for using multimode
                           fiber with VCSEL modulator. <a href="#fig_11">Fig. 11</a> shows the signal characteristics at each node. At the digital domain, only eye diagram
                           for the digital data stream is observed. On the analog block, the effect of adding
                           RF signal to the digital signal can be clearly seen. The time-domain data shows thicker
                           lips in the eye diagram, which means that the RF signal information is loaded on the
                           envelope of the digital data. In contrast, frequency spectrum shows clear separation
                           between digital and RF signal. The side lobes of the digital signal have been truncated
                           by a low-pass filer before adding the RF signal. At the receiver side, the RF signal
                           can be easily removed by the mixed signal divider after the photo detector.

                        <p>One integrated mixed-signal system, so called INC, has been developed and its functionality
                           has been demonstrated. The main purpose of the INC project is to demonstrate the feasibility
                           of SOP technology for the future electronics systems. The system has been designed
                           to deal with digital, analog and optical signal along with the various mixed signal
                           issues. The board has been fabricated in multilayer organic process and the commercial
                           and custom-built ICs have been assembled on the low cost multilayer organic board.
                           The embedded optical waveguides have been fabricated on the board as well. The digital
                           block showed 3.2 Gbps of data stream capability, and the RF block had less than ?1.5dB
                           of insertion loss at 5.8GHHz. The optical block achieved 10Gbps throughput over the
                           embedded optical waveguide. The full functionality of INC system has been successfully.
