                        <p>Wireless DSA networks deployed in the commercial sector will require a number of real-time
                           spectrum management functions; several are especially challenging:
                        </p> 
                        <ul>
                           <li>Ultra fast provisioning and release of RF bandwidth to make efficient use of limited
                              spectrum, to operate in environments that may change many times per second, and to
                              take advantage of short-lived RF micro-environments;
                           </li> 
                           <li>Support for endpoints separated by multiple hops, and by multiple administrative domains;</li> 
                           <li>Support for unicast, multicast, and broadcast;</li> 
                           <li>Support for a broad range of wireless DSA usage models; e.g., where users may hold
                              exclusive rights to their assigned spectrum; where users may ?lease? spectrum in (near)
                              real time and hold it for seconds to days; where users may preempt and seize spectrum
                              in real time and hold it for seconds to days (e.g., emergency services); where users
                              may share licensed spectrum by varying their usage in space or time; where users may
                              operate over blocks of pre-provisioned but unassigned spectrum; where users may operate
                              over shared unlicensed spectrum; and where ?private commons? licensees may sublease
                              spectrum to users that do not fit within traditional dynamic spectrum leasing arrangements
                              (e.g., peer-to-peer devices that do not use the licensee's network infrastructure).

                        <p>A number of optical networks use wavelength division multiplexing technologies. A
                           wavelength is a band of optical spectrum that may be assigned?statically or dynamically?to
                           a single user or source, or used to carry aggregate traffic that has been multiplexed
                           in some way. And it may be provisioned in (near) real time, and held for milliseconds
                           to months.

                           <p><a id="note-ref_3a"></a>JIT ("Just in Time") is a family of simple, fast, out-of-band signaling and control
                              protocols used to dynamically provision and manage wavelengths in optical networks
                              [<a href="#ref_3">3</a>]. JIT is independent of media type, and thus can also be used as a broker of wireless
                              spectrum. JIT is an open, published architecture, and its protocols have been implemented
                              in hardware. Software-based implementations are also available.
                           </p> 
                           <p><a id="note-ref_4a"></a> <a id="note-ref_5a"></a> JIT has been deployed and tested in the Advanced Technology Demonstration Network
                              testbed in Washington DC [<a href="#ref_4">4</a>], which is part of the us Defense Department's Global Information Grid Evaluation
                              Facility, and which serves a number of science, technology, and engineering programs
                              [<a href="#ref_5">5</a>].

                           <h3>B. Reference Architecture</h3> 
                           <p>A reference architecture for wireless DSA networks assumes that a large number of
                              communications devices compete for various parts of the RF spectrum. Devices have
                              varying power and signal sensing and transmission characteristics.
                           </p> 
                           <p>Devices can use the JIT protocol to create requests for spectrum allocations by sharing
                              a low bandwidth common signaling channel. Devices may use other components of the
                              JIT control plane (e.g., intra- and inter-domain routing), to support additional DSA
                              functions?spectrum brokering, preemption, policy management, etc. We briefly describe
                              some of JIT's features in the remainder of this Section.
                           </p>

                              <h4>1) Signaling Channel</h4> 
                              <p><a id="note-ref_6a"></a> <a id="note-ref_7a"></a> Out-of-band signaling is technology-neutral; i.e., the signaling and data planes
                                 are orthogonal, so JIT signaling can be used to support a wide range of DSA usage
                                 models, and to dynamically assign wireless spectrum in a number of ways?based on frequency,
                                 time, space (location or direction), signal characteristics (power, coding) or combinations
                                 of these [<a href="#ref_6">6</a>], [<a href="#ref_7">7</a>]. Most have direct counterparts in optical networks.
                              </p> 
                              <p>A likely implementation for wireless DSA networks is to use an ultra-wideband (UWB)
                                 common signaling channel that does not interfere with other communications, and that
                                 may have a relatively low bit rate. Spreading codes can be used over the UWB common
                                 channel to emulate point-to-point signaling paths between node pairs if required.

                              <h4>2) Message Structure</h4> 
                              <p>JIT control messages (i.e., signaling, routing, network management, etc.) have hardware-parsable
                                 components with hop-by-hop significance, and software-parsable components with end-to-end
                                 significance. The same message format is used by all of the JIT management protocols,
                                 which greatly simplifies their implementation in hardware. The structure allows hardware
                                 and software to parse their respective segments in parallel.
                              </p> 
                           </div> 
                           <div class="section_3" id="sec3b3"> 
                              <h4>3) Provisioning Schemes</h4> 
                              <p>JIT can dynamically provision spectrum in real time. Spectrum requests may vary in
                                 capability (e.g. SNR, interference footprint, path reliability) and holding time,
                                 and may be spread over multiple administrative domain(s).
                              </p> 
                              <p>JIT can suggest an alternate spectrum band if a request cannot be met, and can deterministically
                                 delay a request if a specific band is scheduled to become available shortly.
                              </p> 
                              <p>Spectrum may be released in two ways. Implicit releases are timed, and require the
                                 holding time to be conveyed with the allocation request. Explicit releases issue a
                                 control message.
                              </p> 
                           </div> 
                           <div class="section_3" id="sec3b4"> 
                              <h4>4) Signaling Speed</h4> 
                              <p><a id="note-ref_1b"></a>DARPA XG spectrum sensors obtain knowledge of available spectrum in tens of microseconds
                                 (for a 25?50 MHz sub-band) [<a href="#ref_1">1</a>], which suggests that provisioning must be equally fast. JIT hardware is able to
                                 generate signaling requests in 13 microseconds (using a 400,000-gate field programmable
                                 gate array), and in 1.3 microseconds (using a million-gate FPGA). Signaling request
                                 times can be reduced to 725 nanoseconds with higher speed FPGAs, and to about 200
                                 nanoseconds with pipeline processing and parallelization of control message functions.
                                 A software implementation using a 1 GHz processor issues requests in about 1 millisecond.
                              </p> 
                              <p>This has two important implications. First, traffic in RF environments is inherently
                                 bursty. Coupling fast DARPA XG-class spectrum sensing with ultra fast JIT signaling
                                 means that spectrum utilization can be significantly increased by reserving spectrum
                                 <i>only</i> for the duration of the burst.
                              </p> 
                              <p>Second, ultra fast signaling means that application- and network protocol-initiated
                                 provisioning and release of wireless spectrum is technically feasible. E.g., spectrum
                                 can be provisioned and released on demand by applications like HTTP and by transport
                                 protocols like TCP, rather than being provisioned and held for an entire session.
                              </p> 
                           </div> 
                           <div class="section_3" id="sec3b5"> 
                              <h4>5) Policy Distribution</h4> 
                              <p>Dynamic spectrum management usually requires devices to monitor utilization, and to
                                 request unused or underutilized spectrum as needed. Devices in close proximity tend
                                 to have similar spectrum profiles and may make similar choices with respect to channel
                                 selection. Using JIT to share information about spectrum availability and to make
                                 explicit reservations for spectrum segments can increase spectrum efficiency and support
                                 a higher density of devices in the same area.
                              </p> 
                              <p>Endpoint radios may have policy rules that apply at their locations. If so, JIT can
                                 be used to distribute policy rules. Multicast is an effective way to distribute policy.<a id="note-ref_8a"></a> JIT supports several different types of multicast joins (source-managed, leaf-initiated)
                                 and scope limits [<a href="#ref_8">8</a>].

                              <p>JIT's out-of-band signaling protects network functions from unauthorized use by functionally
                                 isolating the control channel from the data channels. JIT supports encryption and

                              in the heavily used 30?3000 MHz band [<a href="#ref_9">9</a>]. If an endpoint has potential access to multiple 5?20 MHz spectrum channels, then
                              the approximate probability of having no spectrum available when a request is made
                              (i.e., the request is blocked) is a function of the number of candidate channels and

                           <p>JIT uses "tell-and-go" (TAG) provisioning in optical networks to greatly reduce the
                              time required to allocate spectrum. TAG does not wait for acknowledgments from endpoints
                              or intermediate devices (e.g., wireless routers) before transmitting. JIT also supports
                              "tell-and-wait" (TAW) provisioning with reliable signaling in which DSA requests are
                              acknowledged prior to use and which incur a full round-trip delay plus processing
                              time. TAG provisioning is most effective when the blocking probability is low (<a href="#fig_1">Figure 1</a>), and may be appropriate for some wireless DSA networks.
                           </p> 
                           <p><a href="#fig_2">Figure 2</a> shows the differences between TAG and TAW signaling for transmissions that transit
                              multiple hops or multiple administrative domains.
                           </p> 
                           <p>A TAG transmission is preceded by a JIT <code>SETUP</code> message sent over the out-of-band signaling channel. The source does not await confirmation
                              that an end-to-end path has been established; instead, it begins transmitting after
                              receiving a <code>SETUP ACK</code> from the <i>first</i> device in the multiple-hop path. The <code>SETUP</code> message informs each device along the path of the impending data transmission so
                              that spectrum can be allocated prior to the transmission's arrival. Spectrum may be
                              implicitly released if the holding time is known and conveyed with <code>SETUP</code>, or explicitly <code>RELEASEd</code> as in <a href="#fig_2">Figure 2</a>. JIT supports preemption, so a transmission may be allowed to preempt a lower priority
                              spectrum allocation.

                           <p>A TAW transmission is also preceded by an out-of-band JIT <code>SETUP</code> message (<a href="#fig_2">Figure 2</a>). However, the source does not begin transmitting until it receives confirmation
                              that an end-to-end path has been established. Spectrum may be either implicitly or
                              explicitly <code>RELEASEd</code>, and lower priority assignments may also be preempted.
                           </p> 
                           <p>TAG provisioning is important in optical networks where error rates are negligible,
                              and where blocking probabilities are relatively low at offered loads up to 50%. TAW
                              provisioning adds unacceptable delay overhead in these networks?e.g., a 5 MByte burst
                              that can be transmitted in a millisecond over a 40 Gbit/second optical channel may
                              incur several seconds of TAW signaling overhead.
                           </p> 
                           <p>TAG provisioning is less important in wireless networks where signaling channel error
                              rates are relatively high and data channel bit rates are relatively low. TAG's advantage
                              in wireless spectrum efficiency?i.e., transmission time ? total holding time<a href="#fnote_1"><sup>1</sup></a>, may be negligible at holding times above 10 seconds <i>if</i> fast provisioning is available. Confirmation of end-to-end paths provided by TAW
                              signaling is also important in lossy wireless environments. As noted, JIT can support
                              both TAG and TAW provisioning in the same network, so the choice may be left to the
                              application.

                           idle spectrum. Transmissions in this usage scenario are typically short-lived "bursts",

                                    The new paradigm of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks aims to provide opportunistic
                                    access to large parts of the underutilized spectrum. The majority of research in this
                                    area has focused on free-for-all, uncoordinated access methods common in ad-hoc military
                                    applications (Horne, W. 2003; Leaves, P. et al., 2002; Lehr, W. et al., 2002; Schafer,
                                    D.J.; T?njes, R., 2002). We argue that a simpler pragmatic approach that offers coordinated,
                                    spatially aggregated spectrum access via a regional spectrum broker is more attractive
                                    in the immediate future. We first introduce two new concepts, coordinated access band
                                    (CAB) and statistically multiplexed access (SMA), to the spectrum. We describe their
                                    implementation in the new DIMSUMnet (dynamic intelligent management of spectrum for
                                    ubiquitous mobile-access network) architecture consisting of four elements: base stations;
                                    clients; a radio access network manager (RAN-MAN) that obtains spectrum leases; a
                                    per-domain spectrum broker that controls spectrum access. We also discuss in detail
                                    various issues in the design of spectrum brokers and spectrum allocation policies
                                    and algorithms.

                                    Wireless DSA networks may require "new architectures and associated signaling and
                                    control protocols" for their real-time spectrum management component [2].

                                    JIT signaling is an excellent match for so-called "coordinated DSA networks" in which
                                    access to the spectrum in a region or administrative domain is managed by a spectrum
                                    broker [2].

                                    We present an architecture for a core dWDM network which utilizes the concept of optical
                                    burst switching coupled with a just-in-time signaling scheme. It is a reservation-based
                                    architecture whose distinguishing characteristics are its relative simplicity, its
                                    amenability to hardware implementation, and the ability to support multicast natively.
                                    Another important feature is data transparency-the network infrastructure is independent
                                    of the format of the data being transmitted on individual wavelengths. We present
                                    the signaling protocol designed for this architecture, as well as an unified signaling
                                    message structure to be used in conjunction with the protocol. We also present the

                                    We describe: (i) the architecture of an optical burst switched (OBS) demonstration
                                    network overlaying the ATDnet transparent all-optical testbed, and (ii) experiments
                                    underway in the testbed. The OBS overlay uses a simple hardware-based protocol embedded
                                    in OBS network controllers to manage commercial off-the-shelf DWDM switches. Data
                                    paths are all-optical and completely transparent, and can carry analog or digital
                                    traffic in any format, data rate, and modulation scheme. Experiments with latency-
                                    and jitter-sensitive HDTV transmission, petabyte file transfers, and immersive real
                                    time visualization of satellite imagery over the OBS network are ongoing. Parallel
                                    research on transport protocols, QoS-aware routing protocols, adaptors for an OBS
                                    LAN, and network management architecture are applied as completed. This is the first
                                    just-in-time (JIT) OBS field trial known to the authors.

                                    The paper presents current research into the area of dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA)
                                    in the context of a reconfigurable multi-radio environment. First, the DSA concept
                                    is introduced. Then, some possible deployment scenarios for DSA are presented. Based
                                    on these scenarios, some high level DSA requirements on reconfigurability are outlined
                                    from different perspectives (technical, economic and regulatory) investigating different
                                    areas (system, equipment). Two extreme architecture approaches, combining both DSA
                                    and reconfigurability, are illustrated. Finally, we review some of the current technologies
                                    (with emphasis on SDR) enabling the support of DSA. This activity is ongoing and some
                                    more mature results are expected regarding the identification of future research needs
                                    in reconfigurability.

                                    We describe an intra- and inter-domain routing architecture for just-in-time (JIT)
                                    optical burst switched (OBS) networks. The architecture addresses the problem of routing
                                    optical signals of varying types across an all-optical burst-switched backbone network
                                    while maintaining the optical signal quality required by each application. The architecture
                                    distinguishes between routing for bursts and ancillary signaling messages ("data plane
                                    routing"), and routing for other management and control messages ("control plane routing")

                                    JIT signaling can be coupled with other JIT architectural features (e.g., intra- and
                                    inter-domain routing) to effectively manage spectrum in these scenarios [12].
