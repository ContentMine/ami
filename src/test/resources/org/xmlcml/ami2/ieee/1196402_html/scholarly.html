                        <p>There is a surge in demand for high-data-rate connectivity among users in metropolitan
                           area networks. This high bandwidth demand is driven by the increasing commercial use
                           of the Internet, private intranets, videoconferencing, and voice over IP. Providing
                           high-speed connections to the fiber optics backbone (last mile problem) is the key
                           challenge in realizing this objective. Wireless technologies appear to be far more
                           attractive than wired technologies due to low deployment costs, fewer regulatory restrictions,
                           and configurable network topology. However, classical radio frequency (RF) bandwidth
                           is limited and cannot fully utilize the high bandwidth offered by the fiber optics
                           backbone. Free space optical wireless (FSOW), on the other hand, is one promising
                           line-of-sight, high-speed, secure wireless technology that can facilitate the realization
                           of next-generation carrier-grade high-reliability backbone and last-mile network access
                           in an inexpensive and timely manner.<a id="note-ref_1a"></a> <a id="note-ref_2a"></a> <a id="note-ref_3a"></a> For instance, the broadband wireless backbone architecture, based on FSOW links,
                           has recently been introduced in the literature [<a href="#ref_1">1</a>] [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>] [<a href="#ref_3">3</a>]. The multigigabit-per-second data carrying capacity of FSOW systems render them
                           the most economically viable solution for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint deployments.
                           Rapid deployment is another important advantage of FSOW systems that facilitates the
                           realization of high-speed mesh-like networks in urban and semi-urban environments.
                           However, the question that arises next is whether the FSOW technology is mature enough
                           to guarantee high-grade link and network availability figures.<a id="note-ref_4a"></a> <a id="note-ref_5a"></a> <a id="note-ref_6a"></a> Unfortunately, there has been much practical evidence in the literature that the
                           performance of FSOW links severely deteriorates under adverse weather conditions [<a href="#ref_4">4</a>] [<a href="#ref_5">5</a>] [<a href="#ref_6">6</a>]. Despite the fact that excessive scattering due to dust particles, heavy rain, or
                           snow may possibly degrade the quality of FSOW links, moderate to dense fog conditions
                           turn out to be the most challenging factor. This is attributed to the fact that tiny
                           fog particles scatter and distort the FSOW signal in conjunction with absorption of
                           the radiated energy significantly, which causes atmospheric attenuation to reach high
                           levels resulting in link failure. In some scenarios, the overall signal attenuation
                           can be as high as 300 dB/km.<a id="note-ref_4b"></a> <a id="note-ref_5b"></a> Experimental results have recently shown that optical wireless links alone cannot
                           achieve required availability figures over long distances and high data rates [<a href="#ref_4">4</a>], [<a href="#ref_5">5</a>]. Natural movement of buildings is another challenge.<a id="note-ref_7a"></a> The FSOW beams tend to lose alignment due to the relative movement of buildings [<a href="#ref_7">7</a>] and therefore may lead to link outages. This problem can be taken care of via:

                        <ul> 
                           <li>Slightly increasing the footprint of the coverage</li> 
                           <li>Employing auto-beamtracking capabilities in the system</li> 
                        </ul> 
                        <p>In addition to adverse weather conditions, random air turbulence due to temperature
                           variation in the atmospheric layers can also affect the performance in some cases,
                           but not significantly.

                        <p>Our main contribution in this article is to introduce novel architecture and networking
                           algorithms that efficiently exploit the advantages of both technologies. To this end,
                           we first introduce a link monitoring scheme that provides real-time characterization
                           of the link performance under various weather conditions. We introduce a simple yet
                           efficient algorithm for dynamically dcciding the link status based on measured bit
                           error rate (BER) data. Next, we propose a dynamic load switching (DLS) algorithm that
                           partitions the traffic between the two types of links depending on weather conditions,
                           desired link quality, and transmission delay constraints. We present experimental
                           and simulation results that emphasize the significant role DLS plays in utilizing
                           the hybrid architecture and, hence, improving the quality of service (00s). Finally,
                           we shed some light on the trade-off between multihop path availability and delay.
                           This trade-off is attributed to the fact that going over a multihop path, consisting
                           of short-length links, is expected to achieve higher availability than going from
                           source to destination over a long single hop. On the other hand, sending packets over
                           large number of hops increases the end-to-end delay, which in turn leads to QoS degradation
                           for delaysensitive applications. In addition, we provide insights about the relationship
                           between topology discovery and routing criteria on one hand and link availability
                           on the other.

                           We devote a section to proposing novel FSOW link mvnitoring and restoring techniques.

                           conclustion are drawn.

                           <h2>HYBRID WIRELESS ARCHITECTURE</h2> 
                        </div> 
                        <p>In view of the aforementioned challenges, the current trend is to adopt novel hybrid
                           architectures that exploit the complementary nature of FSOW and RF links with respect
                           to their individual weather sensitivities. As mentioned above, FSOW links arc highly
                           susceptible to dense fog, mist, and dust particles, hut relatively less vulnerable
                           to rain conditions. On the contrary, the performance of RF systems degrades significantly
                           during rain events (especially at frequencies above 10 GHz), but they are less susceptible
                           to dense fog particulates. The hybrid architecture combines both technologies to improve
                           the vverall wireless link andlor network availability. Figures 1 and 2 depict several
                           application scenarios for protected high-availability access and distribution networks
                           based on the RFIFSOW hybrid concept. These scenarios include protection for single
                           and multichannel multiservice links, broadband network extension, wavelength-division
                           multiplexed (WDM) synchronous optical network (SONET) ring protection, and terrestrialiairhorncisatelite
                           link protection architectures.
                        </p> 
                        <p>The FSOW and RF subsystems are placed parallel to each other for 1:l protection. Currcnt
                           state-of-the-art FSOW systems achieve data rates on the order of multiple gigabits
                           per second using single or multiple WDM channels. On the other hand, RF systems operating
                           in the 5.4 GHz, 28 GHz, or 38 GHz licensed frequency bands can sustain up to OC-24
                           (1200 Mbls) data rates and 2.5 Chis with polarization diversity. During clear sky
                           conditions, RF channels can be used to augment the overall data capacity of FSOW channels
                           to take over a portion or all of the traffic when FSOW cxperiences total outage. System-relatcd
                           concepts and implcmentation details are prcsented in later sections.

                        </div> 
                        <p>Thc development of adaptive FSOW links requires implementation of a performance monitoring
                           subsystem that can probe and accurately characterize the performance of the wireless
                           channel in real timc. Essentially, the data recorded by the monitoring subsystem plays
                           a crucial role in governing the dynamic link restoration techniques and, consequently,
                           the link performance metrics. In this section we discuss challenges and proposed techniques
                           to characterize the dynamic behavior of FSOW links in response to time-valying weather
                           conditions. To this end, we go through two phases. First, we introduce candidate metrics
                           for judging whether the performance of an FSOW link is satisfactory or not. Second,
                           we introduce a procedure for mapping the gathered measurements to QoS paramcters.

                           <h3>Performance Mefricr</h3> 
                           <p><a id="note-ref_8a"></a>The performance of wireless links is normally characterized by the signal detection
                              threshold which is defined as a lowcr bound on the signal-lo-noise-ratio (SNR) (or
                              equivalently an upper bound on the BER) at the rcceiver [<a href="#ref_8">8</a>]. Therefore, the BER threshold is normally adopted as the QoS parameter for wireless
                              links. In this work, the real-time BER parameter is used to characterize the FSOW
                              channel performance and initiate link restoration techniques whenever adverse weather
                              conditions arise. However, although instantaneous (real-time) BER measurements may
                              be good indicators of the performance of the wireless channel at a particular instant
                              of time, they may not accurately reflect the cause of link deterioration. For instance,
                              link deterioration due to temporary line-of-sight obstructions, which are unavoidable,
                              may erroneously activate expensive link restoration techniques. Thus, the software
                              supporting the adaptive feature of FSOW links must effectively prevent such momentary
                              events and small-scale weather fluctuations from initiating link restoration. This
                              challenge is discussed in more detail in the next section. Furthermore, the FSOW system
                              may utilize multiple environmental and system parameters to define a comprehensive
                              and effective performance metric. For example, received signal strength (RSS), humidity,
                              and temperature, can be recorded and used individually or cooperatively in the decision
                              making process. It is shown later that, unlike optical fibers, the RSS performance
                              parameter alone is not an accurate indicator of FSOW link quality. Average BER turns
                              out to be more accurate in determining FSOW link status.

                           <p>Given the instantaneous BER measurements of an FSOW link recorded every minute over
                              a period of several hours, we noticed that the measured BER values may oscillate between
                              low and highly unacceptable values over a short period of time. The objective of the
                              proposed algorithm is to eliminate the impact of temporary line-of-site obstructions,
                              since they may unnecessarily activate expensive link restoration algorithms. Accordingly,
                              we propose to smooth out the sudden fluctuations in the measured BER data via a sliding
                              window averaging mechanism. Two parameters need to be specified for this algorithm:
                              window.shape and window length (W) selected according to application required QoS.
                              For simplicity, we employ a rectangular window where all samples are given equal weight
                              in the averaging operation. On the other hand, we examine a wide range of window lengths,
                              W = 5?100 min. It is worth noting that the optimum window length, which strikes a
                              balance between filtering out a high rate of temporary link state changes and maintaining
                              necessary information, depends solely on the rate of weather changes and intermittent
                              BER variations. According to the proposed scheme, the system monitors the BER every
                              single minute. However, the link restoration decisions are based on the averaged BER

                        <p>In this section we investigate candidate techniques for FSOW link restoration. To
                           this end, we go through two phases. First, we examine the known techniques of dynamic
                           power and rate control. The transmission power can be increased to mitigate atmospheric
                           attenuation during high attenuation conditions. This can be implemented such that
                           the transmission power increases incrementally in moderate steps to ensure acceptable
                           link quality and energy efficiency. However, boosting the transmitted power is constrained
                           by maximum power, eye safety standards, and health considerations. An alternative
                           approach is to dynamically adapt the data rate of the FSOW link in response to weather
                           conditions. During adverse conditions, the data rates can be reduced in predefined
                           steps to improve/maintain the link QoS.<a id="note-ref_4d"></a> <a id="note-ref_6d"></a> For example, FSOW data rates can be reduced from an optical channel rate of OC-48
                           to OC-24 and further down to OC-12 with successive increase in the permissible atmospheric
                           attenuation levels, as shown by the FSOW link budget equation in [<a href="#ref_4">4</a>], [<a href="#ref_6">6</a>]. Second, we examine two novel techniques for FSOW availability enhancement at the
                           link and network levels: dynamic load switching and multihop routing.

                           <p>The hybrid architecture must be designed such that in the event of adversities, it
                              automatically regulates all RF links into a standby mode followed by automatic switching
                              of data traffic from FSOW to RF as soon as the FSOW link experiences outage. This
                              can easily be achieved using requisite hardware and appropriate software. The system
                              hardware can be configured to monitor the performance of the FSOW link in real time.
                              On the other hand, the system software can be customized to map the measurements to
                              QoS parameters such as average BER or average RSS, as described in the previous section.
                              These metrics can then be used to make necessary link restoration decisions depending
                              on the desired QoS.

                           <p>In this section we present a novel algorithm for utilizing "all-weather" hybrid RF/FSOW
                              wireless links. It partitions the load in the form of incremental load shifting from
                              one link to the other as atmospheric attenuation becomes significant on one of them.
                              The size of these increments certainly affects link utilization and availability;
                              finer increments yield more efficient link utilization and higher availability at
                              the expense of circuit complexity. On the other hand, larger increments simplify circuit
                              design and operation at the expense of poor link utilization. Therefore, the increment
                              size should be chosen carefully in order to balance the aforementioned trade-off.
                              In the simulation study discussed later, we chose the increment size to be <span class="inline-formula"><img align="bottom" src="/ielx5/7742/26923/1196402/html/img/1196402-eqin-5-small.png" width="29" height="16" alt="Formula" /><span class="html-formula"></span><span class="tex">$R/4$</span></span>, where <span class="inline-formula"><img align="bottom" src="/ielx5/7742/26923/1196402/html/img/1196402-eqin-6-small.png" width="13" height="11" alt="Formula" /><span class="html-formula"></span><span class="tex">$R$</span></span> is the maximum FSOW link bit rate. Finally, it is worth noting that the DLS algorithm
                              is expected to be activated periodically at a rate that can be adapted depending on
                              the rate of weather changes. It should not be activated too frequently to avoid processing
                              overhead, and at the same time we cannot tolerate link outage due to long periods
                              between decision epochs.

                           <p>In <a href="#fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, we illustrate the operation of the proposed algorithm. The FSOW link is configured
                              as the primary link and the RF link(s) as a backup that should take over part (or
                              all) of the load whenever necessary. Furthermore, we assume that for each FSOW link
                              there is one (or a set) of RF backup link(s) able to accommodate the maximum transmission
                              rate <span class="inline-formula"><img align="bottom" src="/ielx5/7742/26923/1196402/html/img/1196402-eqin-7-small.png" width="13" height="11" alt="Formula" /><span class="html-formula"></span><span class="tex">$R$</span></span> (i.e., full load) carried by the FSOW link if needed. For instance, for the OC-12

Throughout this article, we refer to the set of RF backup links as one RF link
                              in order to simplify notations. Thus, we assume that initially all traffic is transmitted
                              over the FSOW link (i.e. the FSOW bit rate is <span class="inline-formula"><img align="bottom" src="/ielx5/7742/26923/1196402/html/img/1196402-eqin-10-small.png" width="83" height="13" alt="Formula" /><span class="html-formula"></span><span class="tex">$R_{\rm FSOW}=R$</span></span> and the RF bit rate <span class="inline-formula"><img align="bottom" src="/ielx5/7742/26923/1196402/html/img/1196402-eqin-11-small.png" width="59" height="14" alt="Formula" /><span class="html-formula"></span><span class="tex">$R_{\rm RF}=0$</span></span>. As illustrated in the previous section, the system records BER on both links every
                              minute. To eliminate unnecessary link state alterations, the DLS algorithm averages
                              the actual atmospheric attenuation over a rectangular window of length <span class="inline-formula"><img align="bottom" src="/ielx5/7742/26923/1196402/html/img/1196402-eqin-12-small.png" width="18" height="11" alt="Formula" /><span class="html-formula"></span><span class="tex">$W$</span></span>.<a id="note-ref_5e"></a> <a id="note-ref_6e"></a> Afterward, the algorithm computes the permissible atmospheric attenuation on both

                              link in order to identify the dynamic status of both links and partition the traffic

                           <p>In this section we extend the single link availability study, discussed in the previous
                              section, to multihop networks. More specifically, we focus on improving the availability
                              of FSOW networks connecting several establishments in an urban environment.<a id="note-ref_2c"></a> A mesh-like design that includes long links with RF protection [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>] provides the desired redundancy and allows multihop routing over short-length links
                              via the following techniques:

                           <ul> 
                              <li>Reducing the distance between the transmitter and the receiver</li> 
                              <li>Modifying the routing criteria in order to take link availability into consideration</li> 
                           </ul> 
                           <p>It is evident that going from source to destination over multihop paths consisting
                              of short-length links would achieve higher end-to-end availability than going from
                              source to destination over a long single hop. This is attributed to the fact that
                              shorter FSOW links are less prone to outage due to hefty built-in margins and thus
                              can continue to function satisfactorily even when longer FSOW links experience outage.
                              However, sending packets over a large number of hops would increase the end-to-end
                              delay, which in turn leads to QoS degradation for real-time applications. Therefore,
                              there is a fundamental trade-off between end-to-end path availability and end-to-end
                              path delay. Our main objective in this section is to shed some light on this tradeoff
                              and point out guidelines for striking a balance between availability and delays depending
                              on the traffic type and QoS constraints.

                           <p><a id="note-ref_9a"></a>Shortest path (SP) routing is widely used in wired as well as multihop wireless networks
                              [<a href="#ref_9">9</a>]. It relays packets through the shortest path, where the link metric could be physical
                              length, transmission delay, or load, depending on the QoS parameter of interest. For
                              optical wireless networks, we introduce a new criterion for routing information: link
                              availability. More specifically, we focus on how to make packet routing decisions
                              under severe weather conditions where many links suffer outage. In addition, the routing
                              algorithm should be designed to cope with temporary line-of-site obstructions causing
                              intermittent failure of the optical wireless links. Thus, the impact of FSOW link
                              availability on the following aspects of the routing problem are investigated.

                              <h4>Topology Discovery</h4> 
                              <p>The objective of this phase is to define, under adverse weather conditions, the network
                                 connectivity (topology). This depends solely on the status of various links and the
                                 transmission parameters associated with active links (bit rate, power, etc.). To this
                                 end, the topology discovery algorithm goes through three phases in an attempt to restore
                                 broken links. First, it boosts the transmitted power to the maximum value that does
                                 not violate eye safety standards or cause potential health risks. If this fails to
                                 restore the link, the algorithm attempts to reduce the link bit rate since losing
                                 a connection completely is certainly much worse than communicating at a lower speed
                                 for a short period of time. As the last resort, the DLS algorithm is activated to
                                 restore the disrupted link. The output of this phase includes the following information:
                              </p> 
                              <ul>

                              </ul> 
                              <p>This information is to be fed to the routing algorithm in order to make the best decision
                                 depending on the QoS requirements and weather conditions.

                              <h4>Routing Criteria</h4> 
                              <p>Given the set of available links along with their bit rates and link qualities (measured
                                 by the atmospheric attenuation), we attempt to answer the question of how to route
                                 a packet from source to destination.<a id="note-ref_2d"></a> As pointed out earlier, the speed of wireless links can be traded for their quality;
                                 that is, the bit rate of an optical wireless link can be reduced in order to increase
                                 permissible atmospheric attenuation and hence improve its quality [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>]. Under the proposed scheme, the network is expected to consist of a number of heterogeneous
                                 links ranging from high-speed vulnerable links to low-speed reliable links. A major
                                 challenge is how to route information packets efficiently in this heterogeneous environment.
                                 For example, loss-tolerant real-time traffic should be transferred over high-speed
                                 paths, while delay-tolerant data traffic should be transferred over reliable paths.
                                 Accordingly, the proposed routing algorithm plugs the link quality criterion, along
                                 with the classical link delay and link load criteria, into the link metric depending
                                 on the QoS requirements. More specifically, for real-time traffic more weight should
                                 be given to minimizing link delays, while for data traffic more weight should be given
                                 to minimizing link attenuation. In addition, the interaction between the DLS decision
                                 and the routing decision should be examined. For instance, link failures might be
                                 tolerated if there is an alternate route, via other available links, that leads from
                                 source to destination. More precisely, the problem of path availability could be solved
                                 via either DLS, alternate path routing, or both techniques.

                        </div> 
                        <p><a href="#fig_5">Figure 5</a> shows a schematic diagram of the field experimental testbed shown in <a href="#fig_1">Fig. 1b</a>. A general-purpose computer is used to control the wireless channel monitoring subsystem,
                           traffic switch, BER tester, and link data rate controller. The FSOW transceivers are
                           capable of carrying up to OC-12 data rates (622 Mb/s). The multichannel RF transceivers
                           operate at 38 GHz and are capable of carrying OC-3 data rates on each channel. During
                           clear sky conditions, the FSOW and RF subsystems can provide BER performance on the
                           order of 10<sup>?13</sup> and 10<sup>?12</sup>, respectively, for the ~500 m link length. A pair of optical fibers connects the
                           FSOW transceivers to the BER test (BERT) control panel in the laboratory network center.
                        </p> 
                        <p>As part of the hybrid testbed, two wireless channel monitoring subsystems are developed
                           and compared:
                        </p> 
                        <ul> 
                           <li>Real-time RSS</li> 
                           <li>Real-time BER</li> 
                        </ul> 
                        <p>The RSS-based system involves monitoring and recording real-time RSS values at the
                           receiver end of the system. The experimental results from the RSS- and BER-based monitoring
                           subsystems are compared to ascertain their credibility in judging the time-varying
                           channel conditions. <a href="#fig_6">Figures 6a</a> and b present typical BER/RSS measured performance results for comparison.
                        </p> 
                        <p>The instantaneous RSS and BER values were recorded over 24- and 12-hour periods. From
                           Fig. 6a, it is easily noticed that there is a strong correlation between the real-time
                           recorded values of RSS and BER. During the first six hours, a relatively low RSS level
                           translates very well to the corresponding high BER values. In the next four hours,
                           as the RSS tends to improve slightly, a corresponding slight improvement in the BER
                           values can also be noticed. Finally, during the last two hours (dense fog event),
                           the correlation between extremely low RSS and high BER values can be noticed again.
                           On the other hand, Fig. 6b shows a distinct lack of correlation between the RSS and
                           BER values due to fog scattering and other atmospheric effects. During the first few
                           hours, the RSS level is fairly constant or fluctuates in a very narrow range. Based
                           on the observations from Fig. 6a, one would expect the BER statistics to show a similar
                           trend (i.e., stay fairly constant or fluctuate slightly around the mean value). On
                           the contrary, for the first hour the BER remains high and then abruptly drops to zero
                           (error-free performance). The error-free performance continues for a few hours, during
                           which the RSS values increase significantly.<a id="note-ref_2e"></a> Again, one would expect continued error-free performance since higher power is being
                           received at the FSOW receiver [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>]. However, the BER fluctuates significantly despite the consistently high RSS levels
                           during that interval. Thus, we conclude that the correlation between real-time recorded
                           RSS and BER values may vary over time for FSOW links. RSS-based monitoring systems
                           are more favorable due to ease of implementation and integration into the hybrid architecture
                           than other possible schemes. However, unlike optical fiber transmission, RSS is not
                           an accurate indicator of FSOW link performance, and hence cannot be considered a reliable
                           criterion for activating link restoration schemes.

                        <p>The lack of consistency between real-time RSS values and FSOW system performance necessitated
                           the development of a BER-based monitoring subsystem. The real-time BER statistics
                           measured by the BERT data controller were recorded and processed by a computer running
                           a comprehensive connectivity management and link restoration software algorithm. A
                           rectangular window size of 5 min was chosen for the calculation of the desired performance
                           metric.
                        </p> 
                        <p><a id="note-ref_2f"></a>The dynamic rate control scheme for link restoration has been examined at a fixed
                           BER threshold level of 10<sup>?7</sup> [<a href="#ref_2">2</a>]. However, the FSOW link performance deteriorates significantly during moderate to
                           heavy fog and mist conditions. Despite the fact that power and rate control can restore
                           the FSOW link and mitigate moderate performance deteriorations, the traffic must be
                           dynamically switched from FSOW to RF during extreme weather cases. An automatic feedback-controlled
                           optical switch is used to carry out the traffic partitioning task. The switching decision
                           is based on the average BER calculated from realtime BER values recorded by the link
                           monitoring subsystem. During this experiment, the QoS threshold was preset to 10<sup>?5</sup> under the assumption that channel coding can easily improve the QoS performance to
                           less than 10<sup>?9</sup>. The experimental behavior of the hybrid architecture is shown in <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a>.

                        <p>It is evident from the figure that the performance of FSOW link starts deteriorating
                           due to the gradual buildup of fog. The traffic continues to flow through the FSOW
                           link despite performance degradation until the threshold of 10<sup>?5</sup> is breached. As soon as the predefined QoS threshold level is reached, the data traffic
                           is promptly switched over to the RF link (complete switchover). The control signal
                           and corresponding event A indicate this transition. Error-free data transmission during
                           event A in the figure clearly shows that RF link is not affected by fog. Furthermore,
                           note that as fog fades away, the performance of the FSOW link improves and the link
                           is automatically restored. During this event (between A and B), although the RF link
                           has better QoS, the data traffic is switched back to FSOW to facilitate the possibility
                           of data transmission at higher rates and capacity. During event B, when dense fog
                           rolls in again, the data traffic is again routed through the RF for a few minutes
                           before automatic switch back to FSOW. Thus, <a href="#fig_7">Fig. 7</a> successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of load switching on top of the hybrid
                           architecture. Next, we demonstrate simulation results that reflect the behavior of
                           incremental load switching. <a href="#fig_8">Figure 8</a> shows the dynamic behavior of the actual and permissible atmospheric attenuation
                           measured over time.<a id="note-ref_6f"></a> The permissible atmospheric attenuation of FSOW at maximum bit rate (622 Mb/s) is
                           given by 43.5 dB for the simulated link parameters [<a href="#ref_6">6</a>]. The role of DLS appears at the 13th hour, where the FSOW experiences outage. Thus,
                           the transmission rate over the FSOW link is reduced to 3R/4 via switching a quarter
                           of the load to the RF link. This in turn increases the permissible attenuation of
                           the FSOW to 44.749 dB and hence restores it. When weather conditions improve and the
                           attenuation over the FSOW link shrinks, the full load is switched back to the FSOW
                           in order to resume operation at maximum rate. Finally, it is worth noting that the
                           advantages of partial load switching compared to complete switchover prevail under
                           practical scenarios where the FSOW bit rate is greater than the RF bit rate. This
                           is attributed to the fact that when the FSOW link fails, partial load switching utilizes
                           both links in order to support the FSOW bit rate. On the other hand, complete switchover
                           would utilize only the RF link under a reduced bit rate.

                        <p>Propagation measurements to evaluate the performance of FSOW, alone and as a part
                           of the hybrid architecture, have been consistently performed at our research facility.

                        <p>In this article we present design challenges and potential solutions for carrier-grade
                           availability over FSOW links during adverse weather conditions. We demonstrate a link
                           monitoring scheme that accurately reflects the performance of optical wireless links
                           under various weather conditions. We noticed that, unlike optical fibers, RSS alone
                           does not provide accurate characterization of FSOW link performance. Therefore, we
                           relied on both the RSSI and average BER measurements as the criteria for link adaptation.
                           In addition, we introduced two novel link restoration schemes that efficiently utilize
                           the hybrid architecture:

                                    fixed wireless access technology demonstrator. The system is based on a broadband

                                    A mesh-like design that includes long links with RF protection [2] provides the desired
                                    redundancy and allows multihop routing over short-length links via the following techniques:Reducing

                                    in order to takelink availability into consideration It is evident that going from
                                    source to destination over multihop paths consisting of short-length links would achieve
                                    higher end-to-end availability than going from source to destination over a long single

                                    As pointed out earlier, the speed of wireless links can be traded for their quality;
                                    that is, the bit rate of an optical wireless link can be reduced in order to increase
                                    permissible atmospheric attenuation and hence improve its quality [2].

                                    Again, one would expect continued error-free performance since higher power is being
                                    received at the FSOW receiver [2].

                                    We investigate various design challenges that arise in emerging optical wireless networks.
                                    Due to the high sensitivity of optical wireless links to severe weather conditions,
                                    several methods have been introduced in the literature to improve their availability
                                    figures. We investigate the merits of two potential technologies for enhancing link
                                    and network availability, namely hybrid link protection and multi-hop routing. We
                                    introduce a novel dynamic load switching algorithm that utilizes hybrid links efficiently
                                    and improves link availability. In addition, we provide some insights about the multi-hop
                                    routing approach for enhancing link and network availability.
