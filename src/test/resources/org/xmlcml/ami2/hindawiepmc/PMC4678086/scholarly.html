         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Background</i>. It has been well accepted that insulin therapy is the ideal treatment for newly
            diagnosed diabetic patients. However, there was no study about assessment of the initial
            insulin dosage in new onset Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. 
            <i>Research Design and Methods</i>. 65 newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes (39 males/26 females; HbA1c ≥ 11.80
            ± 0.22%) were investigated. All patients had random hyperglycaemia (at 21.8 ± 3.9 mmol/L)
            on the first day of admission and received insulin infusion intravenously (5 U/per
            hour). When the blood glucose level dropped to around 10 mmol/L, patients were then
            transferred to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The reduction of blood
            glucose levels in response to per unit of insulin (RBG/RI) was recorded. The target
            glucose level was achieved in about 3 days. The total daily insulin dose (TDD) and
            basal insulin dose (TBD) were calculated. 
            <i>Results</i>. TDD was 45.97 ± 1.28 units and TBD was 19.00 ± 0.54 units. TBD was about 40% of
            the total daily insulin requirement. There was a negative correlation between the
            ratio of RBG/RI and TDD. 
            <i>Conclusions</i>. TDD was correlated with blood glucose reduction in response to intravenous insulin
            infusion in Chinese new onset patients with type 2 diabetes.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>It has been reported that the prevalence of diabetes in Chinese adults was up to 11.6%
            by the China Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance Group in 2013 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">

                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Patients with type 2 diabetes in Asian country mainly have impaired 
            <i>β</i>-cell function rather than insulin resistance compared to those in western country
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Therefore, early intensive insulin therapy is used as the ideal therapy to restore
            the 
            <i>β</i>-cell function and to eliminate glucotoxicity in patients with newly diagnosed type
            2 diabetes [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Intensive insulin therapy normally includes continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
            (CSII) and multi-daily insulin injections therapy (MDI). Patients with CSII present
            more prominent reduction in HbA1c and glycaemia with less hypoglycaemic events compared
            to MDI [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">

                  <a href="#B16">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. CSII is widely used in patients with type 1 diabetes, pregnant women with gestational
            diabetes mellitus, and patients with type 2 diabetes in preoperation or those with
            poor glycaemic control [

               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Optimal insulin pump therapy is determined by accurate setting of total daily insulin
            dose (TDD), basal and bolus insulin dose [

                  <a href="#B6">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. It is primary to get the TDD which is normally estimated by body weight (0.4–0.5 IU/kg
            per day) according to the Chinese guideline of insulin pump in 2010 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Basal insulin dose (TBD) is calculated by the certain ratio of TDD. It has been
            shown in a Japanese study that TBD is about 30% of TDD in patients with type 1 diabetes
            who use the insulin pump [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The bolus dosage is adjusted according to carbohydrate factor (CarbF) with “450
            rule” and glucose correction factor (CorrF) with “1500 rule.” However, there was no
            study about the initial insulin dose in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes.
         </p>
         <p>The purpose of this study was to assess total daily insulin requirement and the impact
            factors in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes, who were on transient CSII
            therapy in China.

            <h3>2.2. Protocol</h3>
            <p>A total of 65 Chinese newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes were included
               in this study. All the patients were hospitalized in Department of Endocrinology and
               Metabolism of Shanghai Renji Hospital between July 2011 and December 2013. All the
               patients had random postprandial glucose levels at 21.8 ± 3.9 mmol/L on the first
               day of admission. They were given intravenous insulin infusion at the initial rate
               of 5 U/h (25 U insulin/250 mL saline). When patients received intravenous insulin
               infusion, none of antidiabetic mediations were used. We monitored the capillary blood
               glucose every 30 minutes. The intravenous insulin infusion was stopped when the capillary
               glucose levels were dropped to around 10 mmol/L. The reduction of blood glucose and
               the dose of insulin were recorded and the ratio of the reduction of blood glucose/per
               unit of insulin (RBG/RI) was calculated. All patients were switched to insulin pump
               (Paradigm 712 pump, Medtronic, Northridge, CA) with rapid-acting insulin (Insulin
               Aspart Injection, Novo Nordisk) for 72 hours. Capillary blood glucose levels were
               tested eight times daily (before meal, after meal, bedtime, and 2 a.m.). In 72 hours,
               the basal insulin rate and the bolus insulin dose were adjusted according to the capillary
               blood glucose levels. The target fasting glucose and 2 h postprandial glucose were
               set at 7 mmol/L and 10 mmol/L. At the end of 72 hours, all the patients got the target
               glycaemia. The insulin pump was stopped. TBD and bolus insulin dose for all of them
               were recorded. During the hospitalization, the meals were prepared by dietitians (total
               energy intake 20–25 kcal/kg, 50–60% from carbohydrate, 15–20% from protein, and 20–25%
               from fat). No additional food was consumed unless hypoglycaemic events occurred.

         <p>Our study is the first to show that the initial dose of insulin is related to the

         <p>In newly diagnosed Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin secretion, in particular
            at early phase, is normally reduced due to the impaired

               </sup>
            </span>]. Hyperglycaemia caused glucotoxicity which leaded to further decline of 
            <i>β</i>-cell function [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Patients with type 2 diabetes enrolled in our study were drug-naïve with random
            hyperglycaemia (blood glucose levels 21.8 ± 3.9 mmol/L and HbA1c 11.8 ± 0.2% as shown
            in 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
            </span>). BMI was in the range of 23.8 to 24.2 kg/m² (as shown in 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>

            24 kg/m
            <sup>2</sup>. Therefore, patients in our study were normal body weight or slightly overweight.
            It appears primary for those diabetic patients to obtain the target glucose level
            and reserve 
            <i>β</i>-cell function with insulin therapy.
         </p>
         <p>Intravenous infusion of insulin was previously used to achieve glycaemic target for
            patients in the Intensive Care Unit [

               <sup>
                  <a href="#B11">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] and those with diabetic ketoacidosis due to the rapid action and shorter half-life
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. In order to lower blood glucose level in the shorter period, we infused insulin
            intravenously before insulin pump therapy. Although the decline rate of glucose levels
            may be related to many factors such as the relative degree of insulin resistance,
            the differences in the clearance of glucose in the urine, and the amount of fluid
            infused or ingested into the patient, the RBG/RI ratio has the strongest correlation
            with TBD among all those factors (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). We aimed to find a practical method in calculation of the initial dose of insulin
            in the clinical work. Blood glucose levels at admission were fairly high. Insulin
            sensitive factor itself would be variable due to glucotoxicity. It was not reasonable
            to explore the relationship of 
            <i>β</i>-cell function with TDD during the 72 hours of CSII. It is not surprising that body
            weight was correlated with TDD. We estimated the insulin dose according to the body
            weight (0.4–0.5 IU/kg per day) in previous calculation. We also found that TBD was
            independently correlated with lg (the ratio of RBG/RII) and age with stepwise multiple
            regression analysis (as shown in 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Therefore, we did regression equation as 
            <i>y</i>(TBD = 25.62 − 15.927 
            <i>∗</i> lg(the ratio of RBG/RI) − 0.101 
            <i>∗</i> age) by the software. It may provide the direction that we could easily calculate
            the insulin dose in the future clinical work.

            guidelines for macronutrients [

               </sup>
            </span>]. It is not surprising that Chinese new onset diabetic patients have higher occurrence
            of the isolated postprandial hyperglycaemia than fasting hyperglycaemia (44.1% of
            the men and 50.2% of the women) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">15</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Accordingly, the percentage of bolus insulin dose was higher in Chinese population
            than that in western country.
         </p>
         <p>This study has some limitations. Firstly, we did not use a continuous glucose monitoring
            system (CGMS) before and after the treatment in our study. However, it has been shown
            that eight-point glucose test daily is comparable to CGMS [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B15">16</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Secondly, we did not clarify the correlation of energy intake with premeal bolus
            of insulin. The dietitian prepared the meal according to the body weight. We already
            found that there was a weak correlation between body weight and insulin dose. Finally,
            the duration of this study was relatively short. Longer term studies and larger studies
            are required in the future research.
         </p>
         <p>In conclusion, basal insulin requirement is 40% TDD in newly diagnosed patients with
            type 2 diabetes in China. TDD was related to the rate of blood glucose reduction in
            response to initial intravenous insulin infusion.
