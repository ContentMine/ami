         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Systemic sclerosis is a complex disease due to the variety of clinical presentations,
            often superimposed on other conditions, related or not to the connective tissue. We
            report a 43-year-old Brazilian woman with limited systemic sclerosis and pulmonary
            symptoms secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with a clinical presentation
            similar to a diffuse interstitial lung disease. Because of the frequency of interstitial
            lung injury due to systemic sclerosis, this was an important differential diagnosis,
            which could be excluded after optimized treatment of reflux disease, with clinical
            and radiological improvement. Clinical management of patients with collagen diseases
            requires clinician skills to identify the natural history and understand its nuances.
            This is a common situation in clinical practice, but with a few discussions in international
            literature.

         <p>Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a syndrome with variable presentation and that can present
            superimposed on other diffuse connective tissue diseases such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
            (4% of cases), polymyositis, Sjögren's Syndrome, and Rheumatoid Arthritis [

         </p>
         <p>On its usual presentation and progression, esophagus is the most affected internal
            organ in ES, with 50% to 90% of patients with gastrointestinal complaints [

            </span>]. Diffuse interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the leading cause of death in the progressive
            ES with histologic pattern of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, whose response to
            immunosuppressive treatment is often unsatisfactory [

         <title>2. Case Presentation</title>
         <p>A 43-year-old Black woman, born in Rio de Janeiro, southeast of Brazil, presents to
            the outpatient clinic with a six-month history of shortness of breath and dyspnea
            on exertion and recently started unproductive cough and intermittent fever. She had
            no other respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. During that period, she has been
            treated three times empirically for community acquired pneumonia, with no improvement.
         </p>
         <p>She has been diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus four years earlier by the
            following criteria: facial rash, oral ulcer, hemolytic anemia, serositis, and positive
            antinuclear antibodies titers at 1 : 1280. She was on mycophenolate mofetil 1 g bid,
            prednisone 5 mg qd, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg qd, and sunscreen.
         </p>
         <p>Her physical examination was remarkable for a heart rate of 120 beats per minute with
            no fever, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, with a slight respiratory effort,
            and peripheral saturation of 96% and axillary temperature of 36°C. She had dyspnea
            on moderate efforts and dysphonia. On lung examination, expandability was reduced
            and there were crackles bilaterally. Cardiovascular system showed an A2 component
            of the second heart sound louder than P2. Skin thickening was evident on forearms
            and there was hyperpigmentation with telangiectasia on the face and on the fingertips.
            Hand examination was positive for sclerodactyly and for Raynaud's phenomenon.
         </p>
         <p>Direct laryngoscopy showed thickening of external vocal cords, hyperemia, and interarytenoid
            edema.
         </p>
         <p>Autoantibody panel was positive for antinuclear antibodies with titers 1/1280 (fine
            speckled) and anticentromere antibody and dosage for anti-Scl 70 greater than fifteen
            times the normal range.
         </p>
         <p>For cardiopulmonary study, a spirometry showed a severe restrictive pattern with negative
            results on bronchodilator test, moderately reduced carbon monoxide diffusion, and
            no sign of obstructive airway disease. High resolution tomography of the chest identified
            pulmonary areas of ground-glass infiltrates in the upper left lobe and, even more
            intense, in the lower lobes, showing small foci of condensation in the posterior regions.
            Doppler echocardiography showed diastolic dysfunction grade I, with normal pulmonary
            artery pressure, and the level of serum brain natriuretic peptide was normal.
         </p>
         <p>For gastrointestinal evaluation, an upper endoscopy was done, and the result was reflux
            esophagitis graded C on Los Angeles classification and chronic active gastritis. Esophageal
            manometry showed a motor disorder with marked esophageal dysmotility, mainly on the
            lower two-thirds of the esophagus. 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring was not performed
            because it was not available at that time.
         </p>
         <p>At that time, it was decided to start treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease
            (GERD)—although there were no typical reflux symptoms—and to perform a skin biopsy.
            A distal area of her left forearm was chosen, and histopathology suggested overlap
            lupus and limited systemic sclerosis overlap.
         </p>
         <p>After optimization of treatment with full-dose proton pump inhibitor (80 mg/daily)
            and prokinetic (dopamine antagonist) medications for 8 weeks, the patient regressed
            symptoms. She showed an improvement in dyspnea, complete resolution of hoarseness,
            and significant improvement in the radiological lung image. There was a reduction
            of areas with ground-glass infiltrates, with no signs of parenchymal consolidation
            or new interstitial lesions.
         </p>
         <p>Due to the improvement of pulmonary lesions shown by computed tomography, including
            clearance of the lesion in the left upper lobe, it was decided to maintain the optimal
            treatment of GERD with respiratory sustained clinical improvement after four months.
         </p>
         <p>Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</span> show the pattern of high resolution computerized tomography, before and after treatment

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>The development of lung disease in systemic sclerosis is associated with the anti-Scl
            70 antibody and correlates with worsening of lung function in disease progression,
            measured by forced vital capacity. In the mentioned case, there was no worsening of
            lung function.
         </p>
         <p>The prevalence of diffuse interstitial lung disease (DIP) in patients with systemic
            sclerosis is reported in up to 70% of cases, mostly in patients with diffuse SSc [

         </p>
         <p>Although they are not commercially available, studies suggest that the positive anti-Th/To

         <p>As the chest image was not able to rule out the possibility of microaspiration with
            infectious inflammation in the posterior regions of the lower lobes, and esophageal
            ecstasies, it was decided to investigate esophageal disease.

         <p>Disorders of the esophagus engines are described as a contributing factor for PID

         <p>The establishment of a causal relationship between esophagus and lung involvement

            lung involvement in patients with SSc [

         <p>In this report, the patient had an esophageal dysmotility disorder, markedly in the
            distal part, while in the literature the prevalence in patients with diffuse connective
            tissue diseases and lung involvement is mainly hypomotility disorders or absence of
            peristalsis. The average age at which this diagnosis is often made is 51, relatively
            close to said case (43 years) [

            optimal treatment for GERD discourages the diagnosis of PID, in which case the response
            to treatment depends on immunosuppression, with long-term variance. The presence of
            hoarseness was a clinical indicator of the possibility of GERD with atypical manifestations.
            The temporary return of symptoms that coincided with the suspension of prokinetic
            medications confirmed the importance of esophageal component in the pathophysiology
            of pulmonary involvement. Regardless of these facts, studies have proved the existence
