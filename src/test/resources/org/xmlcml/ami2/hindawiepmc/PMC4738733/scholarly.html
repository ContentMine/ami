         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Multiple myeloma, a plasma cell neoplasm, presents most commonly with anemia, hypercalcemia,
            renal failure, and bone pain. Only few cases of clinical aggressive presentation associated
            with bleeding were reported in the medical literature. The reported cases included
            gastrointestinal bleeding and cardiac tamponade. Spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage
            as initial presentation has not been so far reported. We hereby report a case of a
            64-year-old female who was found to have catastrophic hemorrhage in the retroperitoneal
            region that extended into intrathecal space causing cord compression. The case posed
            a significant diagnostic and management dilemma. This case emphasizes the need to
            think broadly and include multiple myeloma in the diagnosis of unexplained massive
            retroperitoneal bleeding.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Multiple myeloma, a plasma cell neoplasm associated with production of monoclonal
            paraprotein, is second in prevalence amongst hematologic malignancies [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma requires the presence of at least 10% of plasma
            cells in the bone marrow or the presence of extramedullary plasma cell tumor and at
            least one of the following clinical manifestation due to plasma cell proliferation:
            anemia, renal insufficiency, bone lesions, and increased plasma calcium level. More
            recently in addition to the presence of a monoclonal protein the involved: uninvolved
            serum free light chain ratio more than or equal to 100 proved to be of diagnostic
            significance [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The clinical presentation with major spontaneous bleeding is uncommon and seldom
            has been reported in patients with multiple myeloma. Previous retrospective studies
            demonstrated that bleeding tendency is more common with IgM and IgA paraprotein and
            the bleeding tendency in such cases has been attributed mainly to the higher serum
            viscosity due to the accumulation of such immunoglobulins. However, even in such cases,
            severe symptomatic bleeding as initial manifestation of multiple myeloma has not been
            reported [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. We hereby report a first case of IgG lambda multiple myeloma presenting acutely
            with severe retroperitoneal hemorrhage refractory to all medical interventions representing
            a challenging diagnostic and management dilemma.

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 64-year-old female with past medical history of hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, and
            diverticulosis presented to the emergency department with worsening, debilitating
            lower back pain of one-month duration. Further history revealed anorexia, low-grade
            fever, sweating, and shortness of breath for about 3 weeks and 10 pounds of weight
            loss. One month earlier, she visited the emergency department for right lower quadrant
            pain and was discharged with the diagnosis of diverticulitis. Laboratory test at that
            time did not reveal anemia, hypercalcemia, or decreased renal function. An abdominal
            computed tomography done at that time revealed incidental splenomegaly at 14.5 cm.
            Further evaluation was deferred to her primary care physician. At this presentation
            in the emergency department, the vital signs were stable, and she was pale and cachectic.
            Abdominal examination revealed rigidity, distention, tender splenomegaly, and Grey
            Turner's sign. Neurologic examination of lower extremities revealed weakness and numbness
            with hyperreflexia. The rest of the physical examination was unrevealing. Laboratory
            investigation showed the following: white blood cells of 13.8 × 1000/
            <i>μ</i>L, haemoglobin of 9 g/dL, and platelets of 101 × 1000/
            <i>μ</i>L. The peripheral smear showed rouleaux formation and plasma cells less than 10%.
            Earlier laboratory findings showed mild normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and normal
            white blood count. Internal hemorrhage was greatly suspected given the clinical and
            laboratory findings. Other laboratory tests were significant for a creatinine of 2.5 mg/dL
            and a total calcium level of 9.0 mg/dL. Urinalysis was positive for blood and protein,
            511 mg/dL. Prothrombin time was slightly elevated 14.2 sec and a normal activated
            partial thromboplastin time. Biochemical tests revealed a low total protein at 6.5 g/dL
            and serum albumin was low at 2.7 g/dL. Serum LDH was elevated at 240 U/L (60–160 U/L).
            Quantitative D-dimer was more than 0.5 mg/L (reference value is less than 0.5 mg/L).
            Fibrinogen was normal with a value of 194 mg/dL (193–423 mg/dL). Quantitative immunoglobulin
            showed an increased IgG at 2187 mg/dL and decreased IgA and IgM levels. Serum and
            urine immunofixation identified a monoclonal IgG lambda. CT abdomen revealed interval
            worsening of splenomegaly to 20 cm, multiple enlarged lymph nodes, and retroperitoneal
            haemorrhage extending from the left kidney to the left inguinal region. MRI of lumbar
            spine done emergently as the lower extremities showed progressive paralysis revealed
            critical long segment spinal cord compression extending from the T12 to L5 level secondary
            to medullary canal haemorrhage (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</span>).
         </p>
         <p>The patient was transferred to the ICU for developing severe haemorrhagic shock. Based
            on the clinical and laboratory data the diagnosis of multiple myeloma versus plasma
            cell leukaemia was considered. Plasma cell leukaemia was excluded as the peripheral
            blood showed less than 20% plasma cells which is the major criteria for diagnosing
            this condition. The cause of retroperitoneal bleeding in the absence of a bleeding
            disorder, vascular disease, and anticoagulant medications was considered to be related
            to the basic disease of multiple myeloma. Given the emergent and rapidly worsening
            condition, the patient was started on high dose corticosteroids and supportive measures
            including vasopressors and blood products including packed red blood cell, fresh frozen
            plasma, and platelets transfusion. The patient haematocrit and platelets count continued
            to drop precipitously. In 5 days, the hematocrit dropped from 9 g/dL to 5.6 g/dL and
            the platelets dropped from 101 × 1000/
            <i>μ</i>L to 56 × 1000/
            <i>μ</i>L despite supportive measure with blood products. Haematological consult was obtained.
            Due to the poor clinical status, bone marrow biopsy was deferred. Also, neurosurgery
            consultation was obtained to evaluate the developing cord compression. She was deemed
            to be a very poor surgical candidate. The ICU course was complicated with DIC confirmed
            by PT of 24 sec (9–12 sec), PTT of 47 sec (25–35 sec), and fibrinogen of 75 mg/dL
            (193–423 mg/dL), worsening acute kidney injury with creatinine increasing from 2.5 mg/dL
            to 5.5 mg/dL, and acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation
            due to severe refractory anemia leading to high output cardiac failure, and the chest
            X-ray revealed bilateral pulmonary vascular congestion and prominent left-sided pleural
            effusion. Finally, seven days after admission, her code status was changed to do-not-resuscitate
            per her family and healthcare proxy, given her refractory illness and poor prognosis.
            In the same day, she developed cardiac arrest and expired. Autopsy was obtained and
            gross evaluation revealed large blood clot in the left pelvis and retroperitoneal
            space measuring 40 cm in greatest dimension and weighing 1060 g indicating that the
            most likely cause of death was a haemorrhagic shock probably due to underlying bleeding
            diathesis secondary to platelets dysfunction. Microscopic evaluation confirmed the
            diagnosis of multiple myeloma with more than 60% CD138 and lambda light chain positive
            plasma cell in the bone marrow (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</span>). Also, microscopic evaluation of the spleen revealed heavy infiltration of plasma
            cells. Microscopic evaluation of the kidneys revealed light chain casts consistent
            with Bence Jones protein. Congo red staining was negative ruling out amyloidosis.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>This case illustrates a rare and aggressive form of multiple myeloma presenting with
            retroperitoneal hemorrhage leading to cord compression. This type of presentation
            of multiple myeloma is reported for the first time in the medical literature. One
            case of retroperitoneal haemorrhage developed, however, during a well-established
            multiple myeloma and was reported in 1991 and ultimately light chain amyloidosis was
            detected which might have contributed to the bleeding complication in that case [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In general, bleeding diathesis in multiple myeloma contributing to morbidity and
            death is often related to complications due to therapy, infection, renal failure,
            and invasive procedures rather than to the monoclonal paraprotein [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Plasma cell dyscrasia including multiple myeloma is associated with a bleeding
            diathesis in about 15% of the cases. Factors contributing to increased risk of bleeding
            are thrombocytopenia secondary to bone marrow failure, paraprotein induced platelets
            dysfunction, inhibition of fibrin monomers polymerization, monoclonal thrombin inhibitor,
            circulating heparin-like anticoagulant, and acquired Von Willebrand syndrome [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Due to the fulminant course of the disease, we were unable to perform in-depth
            studies of platelets function and coagulation tests. Such studies including thrombin
            time, coagulation factor assays, platelet aggregation studies, reptilase time, mixing
            studies using pooled normal plasma, and protamine should be valuable to establish
            the accurate cause of bleeding and therefore direct the appropriate therapy [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The presenting case brings to attention another cause of retroperitoneal bleeding
            and should urge in-depth workup of the cause of bleeding in patients with multiple
            myeloma eventually leading to a more appropriate management.
