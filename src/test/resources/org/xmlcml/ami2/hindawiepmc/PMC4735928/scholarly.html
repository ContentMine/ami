         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Aortoenteric fistula is an uncommon but life-threatening cause of gastrointestinal
            blood loss. We report a case of a 70-year-old man who presented to the emergency department
            with an episode of melena and infection in the left inguinal region. Diagnosis of
            secondary aortoenteric fistula was made between the left limb of the aortobifemoral
            graft and the descending colon. We performed excision of the infected graft and in
            situ silver acetate coating of prosthetic vascular graft replacement (aortoleft femoral)
            on the patient. This study reports a rare type of secondary aortoenteric fistula to
            the left colon, and it describes an unusual and successful surgical treatment. Antimicrobial
            coating of prosthetic vascular grafts may be a good alternative in the presence of
            graft infection associated with aortoenteric fistula because in situ grafts may carry
            an increased risk of reinfection.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is a rare and life-threatening condition associated with
            diagnostic challenges. AEFs are classified as primary or secondary depending on their
            etiology. Primary aortoenteric fistula occurs when an erosive aortic segment opens
            into the adjacent gastrointestinal lumen. This commonly occurs in abdominal aortic
            aneurysms. On the other hand, secondary aortoenteric fistula is a complication of
            aortic reconstructive surgery involving the use of vascular grafts, and it is located
            between the graft and the adjacent segment of the intestines [

         </p>
         <p>Secondary AEF has a higher incidence rate than primary AEF, with a reported incidence
            between 0.36 and 1.6% [

            </span>]. On average, 75% of secondary AEFs are located between the distal duodenum and the
            proximal suture line of aorta, with less frequent involvement of the other gastrointestinal
            segments. In particular, aortocolonic fistulae are much less frequent, representing
            5 to 6% of the cases [

         <p>Written informed consent was taken from the patient for publication of this case report.
            A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic with abdominal pain and a left
            inguinal wound with discharge. Approximately 9 months ago, the patient had undergone
            an aortobifemoral bypass procedure with dacron graft in an another center, after a
            diagnosis of chronic peripheral arterial disease. In the following course of events,
            two separate occasions of debridement were performed for the left inguinal lesion
            with discharge. No history of massive bleeding with hematemesis or hematochezia was
            present, and the patient was hemodynamically stable at the time of admission. Hematological
            test results were as follows: Hb = 12.7 g/dL; Htc = 39.3%; WBC = 18.2. Due to the
            growth of
            <i> Staphylococcus aureus</i> in the wound samples, antibiotic treatment according to the antibiogram results was
            started. Abdominal ultrasound showed a soft tissue image consistent with infection
            in the perivascular soft tissue around the left limb of the aortobifemoral bypass
            graft. Contrast enhanced abdominal computerized tomography (CT) suggested the presence
            of a suspicious adherence between the left limb of the graft and rectosigmoidal junction.
            Contrast enhanced CT angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) did not
            reveal any pathologies suggesting AEF. The patient had diarrhea during his clinical
            follow-up, and, due to the presence of fresh blood in stool microscopy, a colonoscopy
            was scheduled by the department of gastroenterology. Colonoscopy showed a blood covered
            mass lesion with irregular borders located at centrally ulcerative mucosal areas and
            its appearance was consistent with the graft (see video in Supplementary Material
            available online at 
            <div tagxxx="ext-link">http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/9874187</div>). Since the patient had a prior history of aortic grafting surgery, the findings
            suggested an AEF and graft infection, which prompted urgent surgical treatment. During
            the surgery, the left limb of the aortobifemoral graft was observed to be infected
            and passing transversely into the colon at its distal end. The part of the graft adhering
            to the colon was separated together with the resection of the same colonic segment,
            and a colostomy was performed. The left limb of the graft was resected from the bifurcation
            and from its distal adherence point to the CFA. InterGard Silver polyester graft (Maquet
            SARL, La Ciotat, France) interposed retroperitoneally into a new tunnel. The proximal
            part of the silver-coated graft was anastomosed to the resected left limb of the aortobifemoral
            graft proximally and to the CFA distally. The histopathological examination of the
            resected colonic segment showed a chronic inflammatory process due to foreign body
            reaction. Following the operation, the patient completed his course of antibiotics
            and was subsequently discharged. No postoperative neuromuscular deficits or infections
            developed postoperatively. Two-year follow-up revealed a complete healing of the inguinal
            wound and no complaints of claudication.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Secondary aortoenteric fistulae occur as a result of iatrogenic causes, mostly as
            a complication of aortic interventions. Despite the exact information on its incidence
            due to a lack of epidemiological data, the estimated incidence is around 1% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Most of the aortoenteric fistulae (75%) occur between the 3rd and the 4th parts
            of the duodenum and proximal suture line of the aorta, while a small proportion (5%)
            is located at the colon [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In this case report, a rare case of aortoenteric fistula developing between the
            distal part of the left limb of the aortobifemoral graft and the colon is described.
         </p>
         <p>The pathogenesis of secondary aortoenteric fistulae is controversial with a number
            of different mechanisms proposed for its occurrence. One of the most significant factors
            for the development of this condition is the presence of graft infection and inflammation,
            while another important factor is the presence of a continuous pulsatile movement
            between the graft and intestines (mechanical factor) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Pseudoaneurysm formed by the dehiscence at the infected suture line is associated
            with a wear and tear effect in the adjacent intestinal wall, resulting over time in
            the formation of an aortoenteric fistula. The likelihood of developing a fistula at
            the suture line between the prosthesis and aorta is higher as compared to the distal
            suture line [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In our case, the fistula formed between the stem of left limb of the aortobifemoral
            graft and colon, without the involvement of the suture line. This points out to the
            role of mechanical factors in addition to the infection in the development of the
            fistula in our patient.
         </p>
         <p>Clinical presentation involves infectious and hemorrhagic components. Most of the
            symptoms are nonspecific, such as abdominal pain, high fever, bleeding, and shock
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The very low incidence of this condition and nonspecific signs and symptoms lead
            to diagnostic challenges preoperatively, even with the use of advanced imaging modalities.
            A previous study has found that only 33 to 50% of the cases could be diagnosed appropriately
            before laparotomy [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Contrast enhanced CT is a practical and very useful diagnostic tool. The presence
            of air or fluid in the perigraft area, inflammation in the adherent intestinal wall,
            and presence of contrast material in the intestines are highly suggestive of aortoenteric
            fistula [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. On the other hand, although colonoscopy can provide useful information, it is generally
            insufficient for a diagnosis. Colonoscopy is able to detect the location of bleeding
            in 80% of the cases [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Our patient also had nonspecific signs and symptoms at the time of admission such
            as abdominal pain and discharge from the left inguinal lesion. CT and DSA were not
            able to detect the passage of contrast medium between the colon and graft, and adhesion
            between the two structures was suspected. Subsequent colonoscopy and the history of
            prior aortic surgery allowed us to reach a definitive diagnosis. Examination of the
            intestinal and graft segments surgically removed showed that the two structures were
            intermingled. However, due to the absence of complete erosion on the graft wall preventing
            hemorrhage into the intestinal lumen, the patient did not experience abundant bleeding.
            Colonoscopy provided very good diagnostic guidance in this specific patient.
         </p>
         <p>Immediately after a diagnosis of secondary aortoenteric fistula is made, the patient
            has to be operated on as soon as possible, since mortality rate is 100% without treatment
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Several surgical approaches are used for the treatment of secondary aortoenteric
            fistula. But the most widely accepted technique involves the debridement of the infected
            tissues, repair of the fistula, complete removal of the graft, and revascularization.
            Axillobifemoral bypass is recommended for maintaining the continuity of distal blood
            flow [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B11">11</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, the reported risk of amputation for patients undergoing extra-anatomic
            bypass is 33%, while almost none of the patients who had in situ grafting had extremity
            loss. This was a main consideration in the decision to preserve the existing graft
            in our patient. However, recurrent infection risk is high in patients with in situ
            graft replacement [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Imaging studies in our patient showed a weak collateral circulation in the lower
            extremity. However, since extra-anatomic bypass could result in early extremity loss,
            in situ replacement with an antimicrobial silver-coated graft was preferred to minimize
            the risk of infections.
         </p>
         <p>In patients with aortoenteric fistula secondary to previous abdominal aortic surgery,
            particularly in those with weak collateral circulation of the lower extremity, silver-coated
            in situ graft replacement may help minimize the early postoperative risk of infections
            and amputations.
