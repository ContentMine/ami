         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Implant loosening is not a new phenomenon, nor is implant migration; however they
            are rarely seen after knee arthroplasty surgery. Complications with patellar buttons
            have been reported before with peg failure, loosening, and patella fracture; however
            extra-articular migration is extremely rare. We report an unusual case of patellar
            button migration 11 years after total knee arthroplasty to the prepatellar bursa.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Total knee arthroplasty is an excellent and reliable operation, but opinion regarding
            the need for patella resurfacing remains controversial amongst knee arthroplasty surgeons.
            Patella resurfacing has been shown to reduce the prevalence of anterior knee pain
            following total knee arthroplasty with improved patient satisfaction scores. Opponents
            of patella resurfacing will argue the unnecessary added complications of patella maltracking,
            subluxation, dislocation, fracture, or implant loosening that have been associated.
            However, loosening followed by implant dissociation and extra-articular migration
            is extremely uncommon [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. There has been a case report of a recurrent patella component loosening with subsequent
            extra-articular migration [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. We report a similar case of extra-articular implant migration, but it is unique
            because this was the first episode of aseptic loosening and migration through a lateral
            capsular defect in a patient that was aesthetically unfit for surgery.

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>We report a 76-year-old gentleman who had a right Anatomic Graduated Component (AGC)
            (Biomet Ltd, UK) cemented total knee arthroplasty 11 years previously (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>) at another centre with no immediate postoperative complication reported, who presented
            with a prominent mobile mass over the right knee. The knee was otherwise functioning
            well with minimal discomfort and he had only noticed the mass for the previous 2 weeks
            when he felt it arise from inside the knee after a twisting motion whilst getting
            up. Medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation, obstructive cardiomyopathy
            with poor left ventricular function, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension,
            and a body mass index of 40. Despite these comorbidities he was able to mobilise himself
            indoors holding onto furniture and outside with a stick for approximately 200 yards.
         </p>
         <p>Examination demonstrated a well-healed midline scar and no effusion but a prominent
            swelling anterior to the patella. He had a range of motion from 5 to 100 degrees with
            minimal discomfort except at the end of flexion due to tightness over the patella
            caused by the mass with blanching of the skin (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). The swelling was mobile and smooth and after further investigation found to be
            the patellar button which was aseptically loose (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). Due to his significant medical comorbidities, the decision was made along with
            the patient, relatives, and anaesthetist that the button would be removed under local
            anaesthetic and a formal revision would not be undertaken at this point (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>). Postoperatively he made an uneventful recovery and was back to his premorbid mobility
            at the 6-month review.
         </p>
         <p>Inspection of the implant found that the single peg was intact and no fracture at
            the stem-button interface was seen. The cement mantle was shown to have a good imprint
            of the prepared patella surface indicating good preparation and pressurisation at
            the time of implantation.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Patellar button dissociation is an uncommon phenomenon, even more so when the implant
            migrates extra-articularly through the retinaculum and rests above the patella at
            the level of the prepatellar bursa [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Reported patellar button dissociation has occurred at the level of the peg button
            interface and was suspected before implant retrieval on this occasion [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The nature and path of the migration are also unusual, with the patellar button
            lying within the prepatellar space. Unfortunately the original operation note was
            not available for review, but at the time of retrieval, a defect was found in the
            lateral retinaculum rather than the medial side where a defect in a medial parapatellar
            approach repair could explain the path of the implant as described in another case
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The patient described a varus deformity preoperatively and so a lateral parapatellar
            approach is unlikely. We hypothesised that an extensive lateral release may have provided
            the opening for the implant to migrate through the soft tissues.
         </p>
         <p>Along with other reported complications of patella resurfacing during total knee arthroplasty,
            this unusual complication and also the risks of future component revision should also
            be borne in mind when selectively resurfacing the patella. In this scenario, with
            a high-risk patient, a significant challenge is faced by the surgeon to balance the
            patients fitness and the ideal of revising the implant. There is one previous case
            reported of a conservatively managed extra-articular patellar component by Helito
            et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In that case the implant had already partially extruded through the skin; the implant
            was simply removed and the wound closed. We believe this is the first report of such
            a case with a patellar button found anterior to the patella and successfully managed
            this way. An argument may have been made for leaving the implant in situ; however
            with the blanching of the skin and the natural history of the extruded patellar button
            as described by Helito et al., where the implant came through the skin, it would seem
            advisable to remove the implant [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. We hope this demonstrates that despite there being an accepted first-line method
            of revision resurfacing, often surgeons have to be more pragmatic with their approach
            [
