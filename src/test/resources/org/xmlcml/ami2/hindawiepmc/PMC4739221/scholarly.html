         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Heerfordt's syndrome is a rare manifestation of sarcoidosis characterized by the presence
            of facial nerve palsy, parotid gland enlargement, anterior uveitis, and low grade
            fever. Two cases of Heerfordt's syndrome and a literature review are presented.
            <i> Case  1</i>. A 53-year-old man presented with swelling of his right eyelid, right facial nerve
            palsy, and swelling of his right parotid gland. A biopsy specimen from the swollen
            eyelid indicated sarcoidosis and he was diagnosed with incomplete Heerfordt's syndrome
            based on the absence of uveitis. His symptoms were improved by corticosteroid therapy.
            <i> Case  2</i>. A 55-year-old woman presented with left facial nerve palsy, bilateral hearing loss,
            and swelling of her bilateral parotid glands. She had been previously diagnosed with
            uveitis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Although no histological confirmation
            was performed, she was diagnosed with complete Heerfordt's syndrome on the basis of
            her clinical symptoms. Swelling of the bilateral parotid glands and left facial nerve
            palsy were improved immediately by corticosteroid therapy. Sarcoidosis is a relatively
            uncommon disease for the otolaryngologist. However, the otolaryngologist may encounter
            Heerfordt's syndrome as this syndrome presents with facial nerve palsy and swelling
            of the parotid gland. Therefore, we otolaryngologists should diagnose and treat Heerfordt's
            syndrome appropriately in cooperation with pneumologists and ophthalmologists.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Although it usually
            affects the lung, any organ may be involved. Heerfordt's syndrome is a rare manifestation
            of sarcoidosis characterized by the presence of facial nerve palsy, parotid gland
            enlargement, anterior uveitis, and low grade fever [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Heerfordt described three patients with uveitis, parotid swelling, cranial nerve
            palsy, and fever in 1909 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] and Waldenström classified it as a distinct manifestation of sarcoidosis in 1937
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

            </span>]. A diagnosis of Heerfordt's syndrome can usually be made with confidence on the
            basis of characteristic clinical features. The simultaneous presence of all symptoms
            represents the complete form of this syndrome, with the complete form constituting
            0.3% of all cases of sarcoidosis [

            </span>]. Because of its rarity, there are few case reports of Heerfordt's syndrome in the
            English literature [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">

         <title>2. Case Presentation</title>
         <div tagxxx="sec">
            <h3>2.1. Case  1</h3>
            <p>A 53-year-old man presented with swelling of his right eyelid in March and was referred
               to the Department of Dermatology in a local hospital. A biopsy specimen from his eyelid
               revealed granulomatous blepharitis, and a granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis
               was suspected. In spite of detailed examination, no uveitis or bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy
               (BHL) was detected and he was followed up closely without treatment. He was admitted
               to the Department of Dermatology in our hospital in August, because of worsening swelling
               of his right eyelid. As he also presented with a 3-month history of swelling of the
               right parotid gland and a 1-month history of right facial palsy, he was referred to
               the Department of Otolaryngology.
            </p>
            <p>Physical examination revealed a swollen right eyelid and right parotid gland. He presented
               with a regular general status. Right facial nerve palsy especially in the forehead
               was also detected (House-Blackmann (HB) grade II). A pure tone audiogram showed normal
               hearing and stapedial reflex on the right side was normal. The patient did not complain
               of impaired taste. Ultrasound (US) examination showed an enlarged right parotid gland
               interspersed with hypoechoic areas (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Electrophysiological tests, including electroneurography (ENoG) and the nerve excitability
               test (NET), showed no severe damage to the facial nerve, which indicated a good prognosis
               for the palsy. Positron emission tomography (PET) showed hypermetabolic activity in
               the right parotid gland, right eyelid, anterior mediastinal lymph nodes, groin lymph
               nodes, and subcutaneous nodule in the thigh (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R)
               levels were elevated. Although uveitis was not detected in the ophthalmologic examination,
               biopsy specimens from the right eyelid and the lymph node in the left thigh revealed
               noncaseating epithelioid cell granuloma and a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made histologically
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). Cardiac sarcoidosis was also suspected on the basis of electrocardiogram results
               showing premature ventricular contraction. Finally, we diagnosed this case as an incomplete
               form of Heerfordt's syndrome based on the absence of uveitis.
            </p>
            <p>Oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg per day) was started and the swelling
               of the right parotid gland diminished immediately. Asymmetry of the forehead continued
               for a few months, while the right facial nerve palsy gradually improved and was resolved
               completely at 4 months. Prednisolone was tapered carefully and stopped after 2 years.
               No recurrence has been observed to date.

         <div tagxxx="sec">
            <h3>2.2. Case  2</h3>
            <p>A 55-year-old woman visited our hospital due to left facial palsy and bilateral hearing
               loss lasting for 4 days. She had a history of postherpetic neuralgia and purpura pigmentosa
               chronica. As uveitis and BHL had been previously diagnosed, she underwent a detailed
               examination for sarcoidosis in the Department of Respiratory Medicine in our hospital.
            </p>
            <p>Physical examination revealed swelling of the bilateral parotid glands and her general
               condition was good. No nodules were detected and diffuse swelling of parotid gland
               was observed in the US examination. The facial palsy of left side was categorized
               as HB grade III and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was detected by pure tone
               audiometry (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>). Although geotropic direction-changing positional nystagmus was observed, no canal
               paresis was revealed by caloric test. The patient was negative bilaterally for stapedial
               reflex. NET showed no severe damage to the facial nerve. PET showed hypermetabolic
               activity in the bilateral hilar lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes, lung, spleen,
               and myocardium (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</span>). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed no lesions in her
               brain. Serum ACE and sIL-2R levels were elevated; however, there was no significant
               elevation in serum antibody for varicella zoster virus.
            </p>
            <p>From these results, Heerfordt's syndrome was highly suspected; however, diagnosis
               was not confirmed histologically. As a result of consultation with the Department
               of Respiratory Medicine, treatment with prednisolone was started based on the premise
               that there was a possibility of a delayed histological confirmation of the diagnosis.
               She was treated with prednisolone at 60 mg per day, with the dose tapered after two
               weeks according to our therapeutic strategy for Bell's palsy. The swelling of the
               parotid glands improved immediately and the facial nerve palsy was resolved two weeks
               after the treatment. However, the patient required urgent hospitalization for heart
               failure after 2 months. Cardiac sarcoidosis was strongly suspected as the cause of
               the heart failure.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Heerfordt's syndrome is characterized by the presence of facial nerve palsy, parotid
            gland enlargement, anterior uveitis, and low grade fever [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">

                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Nowadays, this syndrome is considered as a subtype of sarcoidosis, with the complete
            form of Heerfordt's syndrome constituting only 0.3% of all cases of sarcoidosis [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. According to the diagnostic guidelines for sarcoidosis proposed by the Japan Society
            of Sarcoidosis and other Granulomatous Disorders in 2006 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>], Heerfordt's syndrome is classified into complete type, in which all four main symptoms
            are presented, and incomplete type, in which two out of the three symptoms of facial
            nerve palsy, parotid gland enlargement, and anterior uveitis are detected.
         </p>
         <p>The standard treatment for Heerfordt's syndrome has not yet been established due to
            the rarity of this syndrome. However, treatment based on that for neurosarcoidosis
            should be indicated for Heerfordt's syndrome, in which facial nerve palsy is frequently
            observed. Neurological complications occur in 5–15% of sarcoidosis patients, and the
            facial nerve is one of the most frequently affected cranial nerves [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Corticosteroids are thought to be the first-choice treatment in the management
            of neurosarcoidosis in order to suppress inflammation, although prospective, double-blinded
            clinical trials have not yet been administered [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">

               </sup>
            </span>]. Although initial response rates to corticosteroids are high, a relapse of the symptoms
            may occur during the tapering of the corticosteroid dose. In these cases, immunosuppressant
            agents, including azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine A, and cyclophosphamide,
            are used in combination with the corticosteroids [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Cranial nerve palsy in neurosarcoidosis may be caused by nerve granulomas, perineural
            inflammatory infiltrates, increased cranial pressure, or granulomatous basal meningitis
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Further, there is a possibility that epineurial necrotizing vasculitis could also
            lead to nerve ischemia with subsequent axonal degeneration [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">13</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. There are some hypotheses regarding the site of the facial nerve lesion in Heerfordt's
            syndrome. Facial nerve palsy is thought to be the result of direct involvement of
            the facial nerve branches by the parotid lesion [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">14</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This is the most reasonable cause in cases in which nodular lesions are detected
            in the patients' parotid gland (i.e., Case  1). On the other hand, the facial nerve
            lesion might be in the internal auditory canal or intratemporal fallopian canal in
            the cases with hearing loss and/or vertigo (i.e., Case  2). Cases with loss of taste
            and hyperacusis have also been reported [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The presence of these cases implies the site of the facial nerve lesion is not
            limited to the parotid gland.
         </p>
         <p>In Case  2, histological confirmation was not obtained at the onset of facial nerve
            palsy, although sarcoidosis was highly suspected based on the presence of uveitis,
            BHL, and the elevation in ACE. Treatment for the facial nerve palsy was given priority
            over the precise diagnosis of sarcoidosis after consultation with the Department of
            Respiratory Medicine. We used corticosteroids for two weeks based on our therapeutic
            strategy for Bell's palsy and the facial nerve palsy was observed to improve immediately.
            However, due to the delay in the histological confirmation of sarcoidosis, deterioration
            of the underlying cardiac sarcoidosis resulted in heart failure. As the prognosis
            for facial nerve palsy in sarcoidosis is thought to be good [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>

            </span>], detailed examination, including bronchoscopic biopsy, should proceed in advance
            of the treatment for facial nerve palsy.
         </p>
         <p>Sarcoidosis is a relatively uncommon disease for the otolaryngologist. However, the
            otolaryngologist may encounter Heerfordt's syndrome as this syndrome presents with
            facial nerve palsy and swelling of the parotid gland. Therefore, we should diagnose
            and treat Heerfordt's syndrome appropriately in cooperation with specialists in respiratory
            medicine and ophthalmologists.
