         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Background</i>. The patient-doctor relationship is an important issue in health care as it is linked
            to patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and treatment outcome. The PDRQ-9 is
            brief instrument which has an excellent overall internal consistency to measure it.
            <i> Objective</i>. It was aimed at developing a culturally adapted and validated Bangla version of
            Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (PDRQ-9).
            <i> Method</i>. Data were collected during the period of May 2015 to July 2015 from 50 patients
            by interviewing with the final Bangla version of PDRQ-9 obtained by ideal translation-back
            translation procedure with nonprobability purposive consecutive sampling and analyzed
            by Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS) 16.0 and Microsoft Excel 2007 version
            software.
            <i> Result</i>. The internal consistency of Bangla PDRQ-9 was measured by Cronbach's 
            <i>α</i> which was 0.97. Only one factor was extracted from varimax rotation factor analysis
            with high commonalities between the items.
            <i> Conclusion</i>. Bangla version of PDRQ-9 is valid, accepted, and widely applicable in clinical practice,
            research, public health, and primary health care in Bangladesh.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>The patient-doctor relationship (PDR) is an important concept in health care [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Throughout the history of medicine, patients and doctors have scrutinized and debated
            their relationship, which is undoubtedly one of the most difficult among interpersonal
            relations, for a variety of reasons [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. It has been linked to patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and treatment
            outcome. In primary care, “knowing the patient is at least as important as knowing
            the disease,” and physicians with a warm and friendly style are more effective than
            physicians with a more formal style [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. It was found that patients search out a Primary Care Practitioner (PCP) who matches
            their own representation of an ideal and validate their choice in a dynamic communicative
            process [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Patient satisfaction is a concept that reflects the patient's perception regarding
            the care quality and treatment received. Generally evaluated by self-report, several
            questionnaires focused on decision making, access, and use of the different health
            services or on the treatment satisfaction [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The measurement instruments of the patient-doctor relationship make it possible
            to quantify the patient's opinion regarding communication, satisfaction, and accessibility
            in the dealing with the doctor and the treatment followed [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Substantial efforts have been made to develop instruments and to assess the PDR
            from the patient's point of view. A systematic review found 19 instruments with a
            variety of dimensions and used diverse conceptual models for the PDR and recommended
            the use of the Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (PRDQ-9) as a brief (9 items)
            questionnaire with excellent overall internal consistency [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Bengali is one of the sixth most widely spoken languages in the world with nearly
            300 million users. In 2050 estimated Bengali speaking population will be nearly 400
            million [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. At present there is no culturally adapted scale to measure the patient doctor relationship
            in Bangla. So, it was aimed at developing a culturally adapted and validated Bangla
            version of Patient-Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (PDRQ-9) for use in assessing
            the relationship between the physician and the patient as PDRQ-9 is brief short easily
            applicable tool.

            <h3>2.1. Ethical Consideration</h3>
            <p>The researcher was duly concerned about the ethical issues relate to the study. Formal
               ethical clearance was taken from the ethical review committee of the ASA University
               Bangladesh for conducting the study and formal permission was taken from the questionnaire
               developing author, Christina M. Van der Feltz-Cornelis. Confidentiality of the person
               and the information was maintained and observed and unauthorized persons did not have
               any access to the data. Informed written consent was taken from the subject informing
               the nature and purpose of the study, the procedure of study, and the right to refuse,
               accept, and withdraw to participate in the study and the participants did not gain
               financial benefit from this study. The present study posed a very low risk to the
               participants, as procedures such as medical treatments, invasive diagnostics, or procedures
               causing psychological, spiritual, or social harm were not included.

            <h3>2.2. Instrument Development</h3>
            <p>The adaptation to Bengali was performed according to the state-of-the-art procedure
               of forward-backward translation of English PDRQ-9 by 1 medical doctor and 1 psychologist;
               both of them are native speakers of the Bangla and are fluent in English. The 2 Bangla
               versions were compared, and an updated Bangla forward version was compiled. This version
               was translated back into English by a professional translator with experience in medical
               translation and by 1 medical doctor who had not been involved in the forward translation.
               The back-translated versions were then compiled and compared by the researcher. These
               versions were submitted to the University expert committee. Thus, an optimized Bangla
               version was generated and with that optimized Bangla version pretesting was done and
               supposed changes were made accordingly. Thus, the final Bangla version of PDRQ-9 was
               developed [

               study was conducted at Psychiatry Out-Patient Department (OPD) of Dhaka Medical College
               Hospital (DMCH) and data were collected during the period of May 2015 to July 2015
               from 50 patients with the final Bangla version of PDRQ-9 with nonprobability purposive
               consecutive sampling. The interview was performed by the researcher himself through
               face-to-face interview technique. The participants who were above the age of 14 years,
               were willing to participate in the study, and can read Bangla were included in the
               study. Participants not willing to participate and who made first visit to the respective
               physicians were excluded. Sample size was estimated on basis of more than 5 : 1 ratio
               of participants to item as variable recommendations available considering rules of
               thumb regarding the minimum ratio of participants to variables 2 : 1 or extracted

               to indicate the appropriateness of each statement as a description of how they feel
               about their doctor in different aspects. After managing data properly it was analyzed
               in SPSS 16 version and Microsoft Excel Software 2007 version.

            attitude. Relationship between patient and physician has been discussed from the origin
            of medicine. PDRQ-9 was developed by Van Der Feltz-Cornelis et al. in 2004, a Patient-Doctor
            Relationship Questionnaire (PDRQ-9) in primary care based on Alexander and Luborsky
            developed the Helping Alliance Questionnaire (HAQ), and Van der Linden validated Dutch

         <title>5. Conclusion</title>
         <p>The results from this evaluation indicate good psychometric properties of the PDRQ-9
            Bangla. This Bangla validated scale will be helpful to assess the relationship between
            physician and patients in clinical practice, research, public health, and primary
            health care in Bangladesh. Though it is the first validated scale in Bangla for measuring
            the patient-doctor relationship and a very good scale to measure the relationship
            in a very short time in clinical practice, public heath, health research, and primary
            health care, with this minimum sample, generalization of the study result may be difficult.
            Data were collected from the patients visiting a hospital of a city, but those from
            hospitals or institutions of other regions and heterogeneous groups were not included.
            This instrument bears only the patients' direction of the relationship; doctors' direction
            was not to be evaluated. Larger studies involving more heterogeneous patients may
            help to provide a more complete picture of impact of patient-doctor relationship in
            Bangladesh.
