         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Muscle hernia is an uncommon cause of leg swelling. It can be detected in the early
            stages only if there is a high index of suspicion. It is common in lower extremity
            compared to the upper extremity. Tibialis anterior muscle in the leg is commonly involved.
            Dynamic sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the mainstay in their
            diagnosis, which demonstrate a facial defect with herniation of muscle fibers. We
            report a case of 23-year-old male patient who presented with a painless swelling in
            the anterolateral aspect of the left upper leg. Dynamic sonography done with high-resolution
            probe demonstrated a defect in fascia overlying tibialis anterior with herniation
            of outer muscle fibers which increased during dorsiflexion and reduced in the supine
            position at rest. MRI of the left leg confirmed the findings.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Muscle hernia is also called myofascial herniation. Muscle herniation of the lower
            extremity is a rare entity and is often asymptomatic. Symptomatic muscle hernias commonly
            occur in the leg and cause chronic leg pain due to nerve involvement. The focal fascial
            defect with resultant muscle herniation into subcutaneous fat presents clinically
            as a soft tissue mass. Clinicians must remember to consider myofascial herniation
            in the differential diagnosis of chronic leg pain or neuropathy. We present a case
            of tibialis anterior muscle herniation due to overlying fascial defect presenting
            as a palpable mass detected on dynamic sonography and MRI.

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 23-year-old male presented with painless swelling in the anterolateral aspect of
            the left upper leg for 1-year duration. The swelling was prominent in standing position
            and reduced in lying down position at rest. There was no history of trauma. On local
            examination, a diffuse swelling appeared in the anterolateral aspect of the left upper
            leg in standing position which accentuated dorsiflexion of the foot and reduced in
            the supine position. It was nontender. Overlying skin temperature and color were normal.
            Local ultrasonography (USG) done with a high-resolution linear probe (frequency: 7
            to 12 MHz) in standing position showed intact echogenic fascia overlying tibialis
            anterior superior to site of swelling (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</span>) and a defect of size 9.9 mm in echogenic fascia in the anteroposterior direction
            overlying the tibialis anterior in upper third of leg, extending superoinferiorly
            over a length of approximately 5.5 cm at site of swelling. There was herniation of
            the outer fibers of tibialis anterior muscle through this defect (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</span>). Muscle hernia showed reduction in lying down position (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(d)</span>). Limited MRI (static) of the left leg was performed at rest for confirmation of
            USG findings by taking coronal T1 and T2 sequences (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</span>) followed by axial PD fat saturated sequence (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</span>) after placing a marker at the site of diffuse swelling. MRI confirmed a fascial
            defect overlying tibialis anterior measuring 1.2 cm in width extending superoinferiorly
            over a length of 5.5 cm with resultant muscle herniation and outward bulge of tibialis
            anterior. Outer fibers of tibialis anterior revealed subtle hyperintense signal on
            PD fat saturated sequence suggestive of muscle edema (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(c)</span>). The patient was referred to the orthopedic department for repair of myofascial
            defect which he refused.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Ihde provided original investigation and ground work on lower extremity muscle hernias
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Largest contribution is due to the combined efforts of military surgeons who observed
            muscle hernias in actively training military recruits; otherwise it occurs as sporadic
            cases. The majority of the earlier work of leg hernias is found in French medical
            literature which is based on military experience [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Ihde in 1929 reported a series of 12 patients with hernias of leg and acknowledged
            the earlier description by Richet in 1853 and first actual definition provided in
            1861 by Mourlon as “the displacement of muscle beyond its ruptured aponeurosis” [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Muscle hernias are caused by a focal defect in the fascial sheath. It is classified
            by Ihde [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>] as constitutional (congenital) and traumatic (acquired). Congenital causes may be
            due to general weakness in muscular fascia (mesodermal insufficiency) or occur at
            sites of perforating nerves and vessels. Acquired cases are secondary to trauma as
            seen in penetrating trauma, direct trauma causing close fracture with fascial tear,
            and indirect trauma (force applied to contracted muscle causing fascial rupture) [

                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Increase in intracompartmental pressure seen in muscle hypertrophy or chronic exertional
            compartment syndrome (CECS) potentiates herniation [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">

                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Regular cardiovascular exercise and physical activity cause muscle hypertrophy
            with a 20% increase in muscle volume. CECS is a reversible form of abnormally increased
            intramuscular pressure during physical exertion or exercise secondary to noncompliance
            of osteofascial tissue to exercise-induced increase in muscle volume [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The true incidence of a leg hernia is not known, as most are asymptomatic and remain
            undiagnosed and are not brought to the attention of the physician. About 200 cases
            of muscle hernias are described in the literature [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Military soldier, athletes, mountain climbers, and skiers are the demographic population
            at highest risk who are prone to CECS. Fascial defects are found in 15–50% of patients
            undergoing surgery, even with normal preoperative examination [

         </p>
         <p>The anterolateral tibial compartment is the commonest site due to superficial and
            tight fascial compartment [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">

               </sup>
            </span>]. A high index of suspicion and awareness of a muscle hernia helps in its early diagnosis.
            In the leg, tibialis anterior is the most commonly involved muscle and most reported
            in the literature. The fascia of tibialis anterior is more vulnerable to trauma as
            it is the weakest fascial point in the lower extremity [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Other muscles involved are peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, extensor digitorum
            longus, gastrocnemius, and flexor digitorum longus. Multiple hernias within the same
            muscle and bilateral symmetrical involvement may also be seen in the thigh. Iatrogenically
            induced hernia, involving rectus femoris and vastus lateralis, can occur as a complication
            following an anterolateral thigh perforator flap and after fascia lata harvest for
            cruciate ligament repair. The lower incidence of a muscle hernia in a peroneal compartment
            is due to a relatively large subcutaneous surface area aligning for increase compliance.
         </p>
         <p>On clinical examination, muscle hernia may present as a palpable bulge, soft tissue
            mass, or subcutaneous nodule. It may be solitary, multiple, or bilateral. It is usually
            reducible on lying down. It may be irreducible when there is strangulated muscle.
            The patient may complain of pain, discomfort, weakness, cramping, or neuropathy. It
            worsens with standing and physical activity. On examination, local tenderness and
            decreased sensation may occur if there is associated nerve involvement. Herniation
            of tibialis anterior is pronounced with resisting dorsiflexion of the foot. If reducible,
            the fascial defect may be appreciated. A muscle hernia is commonly seen in adolescence
            and young adults who present with swelling which appears or enlarges on standing erect
            or when affected muscle is contracted. The swelling reduces when the patient is supine
            or muscle is relaxed. Differential diagnosis of muscle hernias are varicosities, angiomas,
            arteriovenous malformation, lipomas, ruptured muscle (a pseudohernia), and soft tissue
            tumors [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Dynamic sonography and MRI are diagnostic in detecting a myofascial defect. Dynamic
            sonography detects muscle bulge through the fascial defect on muscle contraction and
            reduces on relaxation. Sonography is advantageous as it is real time, muscle herniation
            is detected during dynamic examination, and nature of the lesion can be shown to the
            patient which helps in reassurance. The examination is done in standing position or
            by contracting the muscle. Marking of overlying skin is done as the mass may be difficult
            to be felt. High-frequency probe (more than 7.5 MHz) is used after liberal application
            of coupling gel. Gain and focus are set to optimize near field. The transducer is
            applied lightly as heavy pressure can efface a hernia [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Normal muscle is covered by thin echogenic fascia. In mild cases, fascia is thinned
            out with no demonstrable defect. There is a mild muscle bulge with an elevation of
            the overlying fascia. In overt cases, the margins of the defect are clearly defined
            with outward bulge and herniation of muscle through the defect. The herniated muscle
            and adjoining nonherniated muscle are less echogenic than normal muscle due to anisotropy
            or atrophy caused by low-grade repetitive trauma. Frank's hernia gives mushroom-like
            appearance causing convex superficial contour with herniated muscle overlapping the
            fascial defect. Spoke-like appearance caused by normal echogenic fibroadipose septae
            is seen as they are pinched through the fascial defect as they radiate from the center
            of the defect in the fascia. In a few cases, a prominent arterial pulsation can be
            identified on contour or power Doppler supporting the theory of muscle herniation
            at sites of weakness where vessels penetrate the fascia. USG is relatively easy and
            of low cost. 3D dynamic USG with surface rendering improves visualization of focal
            planes and the muscular protrusion and is superior to traditional 2-dimensional ultrasonography
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">

         </p>
         <p>Though expensive, MRI confirms muscle herniation in equivocal USG findings. It better
            visualizes musculofascial demarcation and allows quantification of fascial splitting
            and muscle herniation. Dynamic ultrasonography and MRI incorporate fast imaging with
            forced muscular movements (dorsiflexion and plantar flexion at the ankle) and enable
            better visualization and pinpointing of the hernia and fascial defect. The defect
            is in the deep layer of the deep fascia. It may thin or elevate the superficial layer
            of deep fascia which is overlying the muscle [

            </span>]. Treatment of tibialis anterior herniation is controversial. Asymptomatic hernias
            require no specific treatment and rupture reassurance. Mildly symptomatic hernias
            often respond to conservative treatment with restriction of exercise and use of elastic
            support. The surgical option is the direct closure of the defect. However, it causes
            an increase in intracompartmental pressure accentuated in the postoperative period
            by edema causing recurrence. The fascial opening can be repaired with a patch of fascia
            lata or periosteal graft. However, this may be a cause of compartment syndrome and
            need an additional donor. Hence, recommended treatment is longitudinal fasciotomy
            which prevents the development of compartment syndrome [
