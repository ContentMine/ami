         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Ossified ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a condition of heterotopic lamellar bone formation
            within the yellow ligament. Some patients with OLF can be asymptomatic. However, asymptomatic
            OLF may not be obvious on preoperative MRI and could increase the risk of iatrogenic
            injury during treatments for unrelated spinal conditions. This report describes a
            case of spinal cord injury caused by the indirect transmission of force from an osteotome
            to an asymptomatic OLF during the resection of a thoracic inferior articular process
            (IAP). To prevent this outcome, we urge careful review of CT imaging in the preoperative
            setting and advocate the use of a high-speed drill instead of an osteotome during
            bone removal in the setting of an adjacent area of OLF.

            </span>]. It is well known that OLF can cause myelopathy as the lesion grows, which may require
            surgical management [

         <p>However, some patients with OLF can be asymptomatic [

            OLF may increase the risk of iatrogenic injury during treatments for adjacent disease.
            To our knowledge, this has not been reported.
         </p>
         <p>Resection of a thoracic inferior articular process (IAP) is frequently performed to
            expose the thoracic pedicle screw entry site during preparation for screw placement.
            The IAP is traditionally removed with either an osteotome or a high-speed drill. We
            report an iatrogenic spinal cord injury caused by indirect transmission of force from
            an osteotome to a previously asymptomatic OLF while resecting a thoracic IAP.

            <h3>2.1. History and Examination</h3>
            <p>A 71-year-old Caucasian woman with symptomatic kyphoscoliosis and multilevel lumbar
               spinal stenosis had been followed up in our clinic for sagittal imbalance and fatigue
               with progressive low-back and leg pain as well as subjective weakness of the legs
               bilaterally (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Physical therapy and epidural steroid injections failed to improve her symptoms.
               Her strength and reflexes were normal in the lower extremities. She was elected for
               surgery after conservative measures failed to improve her symptoms.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div tagxxx="sec">
            <h3>2.2. Operation</h3>
            <p>We performed T10 to pelvic fixation with posterior laminectomies from L2 to S1, a
               pedicle subtraction osteotomy at L3 to correct her sagittal imbalance, and transforaminal
               lumbar interbody fusion at L5-S1 to decrease the L5-S1 pseudarthrosis rate. Initial
               neurophysiologic monitoring demonstrated consistently robust responses. An osteotome
               and mallet were used to resect the IAPs in preparation for pedicle screw placement.
            </p>
            <p>During resection of the leftT11 IAP, somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor
               evoked potentials (MEPs) were lost immediately after impact of the osteotome. The
               resection of this IAP was performed in a standard fashion and the spinal canal was
               not violated during this maneuver. We further inspected the area and did not find
               fracture of the adjacent superior articular process or lamina. The screw tracts were
               checked and none of the pedicle screws violated the spinal canal. We reviewed her
               preoperative MRI and the canal did not demonstrate clear stenosis or compression at
               that level (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). In an attempt to restore monitoring, her mean arterial pressure (MAP) was increased
               and sedation decreased. We contemplated performing a Stagnara test, but the SSEPs
               and MEPs improved. Given this improvement, and the difficulty in performing a Stagnara
               test in a geriatric patient, we elected to proceed with the operation. During closure
               of the PSO, the MAP was maintained above 90 and the osteotomy closed well with only
               minor dural buckling. The operation was further complicated by an unintended durotomy
               at the L3-4 level which was primarily closed.
            </p>
            <p>Postoperatively, the left leg was plegic with 2/5 strength in the right leg. While
               still intubated, we transported her to the computed tomography (CT) scanner. Thoracic
               CT scans demonstrated a preexisting area of hypertrophic bone not obvious on the MRI
               which was reviewed intraoperatively (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</span>). Bilateral osteophytes, consistent with OLF, were occupying the canal at the T10-11
               level. The osteophyte on the left was larger than the one on the right. We felt the
               compression secondary to the OLF was likely aggravated by the use of the osteotome
               during the SPO. Therefore, we returned to the OR for emergent decompression. This
               was achieved with a T10-11 laminectomy and bilateral OLF resection with the M8 drill
               and Kerrison instruments (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</span>). After the laminectomy, strength was 4/5 in the right leg, 2/5 in the proximal left
               leg, and 4/5 in the distal left leg.

         <div tagxxx="sec">
            <h3>2.3. Postoperative Course</h3>
            <p>Her postoperative course was complicated by a pulmonary embolism on postoperative
               day (POD) three, which required systemic anticoagulation. Her neurologic exam improved
               minimally prior to discharge on POD 10, and she was still unable to independently
               ambulate at that time. On POD 15, the patient returned with cerebral spinal fluid
               (CSF) leaking through the caudal aspect of the incision. She required two additional
               operations and temporary CSF diversion via a lumbar subarachnoid drain to stop the
               leak. By POD 32, the incision was fully healed and she had no residual signs or symptoms
               of persistent CSF leakage. Her postoperative course was further complicated by a non-ST
               elevation myocardial infarction treated with aspirin and beta blockers. She was discharged
               to a rehabilitation facility on POD 40.
            </p>
            <p>Two months postoperatively, she had full strength and was able to walk independently.
               However, she had some residual lower extremity hyperreflexia secondary to the intraoperative
               spinal cord injury. She reported that while her preoperative symptoms were not completely
               resolved, they were improved. She continues to ambulate independently upon one-year
               follow-up, with no radiographic evidence of hardware failure (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>).

            patients are mixed (10–30% of patients experience neurological deficits after decompression
            for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament) [

            </span>], no cases of iatrogenic injury due to asymptomatic OLF have been previously reported.
            The preceding case reflects a mechanism by which an incidental OLF facilitated iatrogenic
            injury secondary to correction of a different degenerative condition, which to our
            knowledge has not been previously reported. We performed a review of the literature
            to evaluate the pertinent aspects of this case and suggest general recommendations
            intended to minimize such incidents in the future.
         </p>
         <p>The clinical presentation of OLF is dependent on the region of compression. Myelopathy
            is by far the most common presentation since most lesions occur in the thoracic and
            cervical regions [

            was asymptomatic from her OLF. A handful of cases have also described radiculopathy
            as a diagnostic possibility of OLF, although this was not observed in our case and
            is quite rare [

         </p>
         <p>The measured prevalence of OLF varies based on the selected imaging modality and study
            population. One cross-sectional study that analyzed thoracic CT scans from Chinese
            patients admitted for chest pain reported an OLF prevalence rate of 63.9% [

            </span>]. An American study that analyzed CT scans obtained from a similar patient population

               </sup>
            </span>], while a study that analyzed MRI instead of CT scans reported an OLF prevalence
            rate of only 3.8% [

               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. These data demonstrate that CT is a more sensitive imaging modality for detecting
            OLF and highlight a higher prevalence in Asian populations. These differential prevalence
            rates suggest that OLF may often be asymptomatic and underreported in those only receiving
            MRIs. Thus, the mechanism of injury from our case may be relevant to a large number
            of patients.
         </p>
         <p>This case demonstrated a calcified mass that was not clearly visible on preoperative
            MRI but could be observed on CT. The evolution of these lesions explains the differing
            sensitivities of various imaging modalities. OLF usually starts laterally, in the
            capsular portion of the ligamentum flavum, and then spreads to involve the medially
            located, interlaminar portion [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">

               </sup>
            </span>]. At this stage, the ossification only represents a thin strip of bone that may not
            be discernible from adjacent structures on MRI [

               </sup>
            </span>]. In such instances, CT has been shown to be more sensitive for resolving the pathology
            because the appearance of a hyperdense osteophyte is more obvious than the hypointense
            appearance on MRI [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Without cause to take notice, we did not appreciate the area of OLF when we reviewed
            her CT scan to plan our osteotomies and pedicle screw trajectories. Furthermore, when
            SSEPs and MEPs were lost intraoperatively, we reviewed the preoperative MRI but did
            not review the CT. On the MRI, we did not appreciate the area of OLF. Had we had reviewed
            the preoperative CT after losing SSEPs and MEPs, we would have recognized the OLF
            and immediately performed a decompressive laminectomy and OLF resection, without having
            to take the patient back to the operating room a second time. Thus, we recommend that
            surgeons review both preoperative MRI and CT scans when MEPs and SSEPs are lost intraoperatively.
         </p>
         <p>The theorized mechanism of injury during this case involved the transmission of force
            from the osteotome to the OLF. In order to resect the T11 IAP, the osteotome was initially
            directed in a rostral orientation. We propose that when the IAP was struck with the
            osteotome, the force vector was also directed rostrally through the OLF, which resided
            at the T10-11 level. This subsequently resulted in contusion of the spinal cord adjacent
            to the OLF. Therefore, we strongly suggest that surgeons consider using a high-speed
            drill rather than an osteotome when removing bone adjacent to areas of stenosis such
            as OLF, even if these areas are asymptomatic preoperatively.
         </p>
         <p>To avoid the possibility of iatrogenic injury due to an asymptomatic OLF, it is critical
            to entertain OLF as a diagnostic possibility, even in asymptomatic patients, when
            reviewing preoperative films. Since CT is more sensitive and specific for these lesions,
            we recommend careful scrutiny of preoperative CT scans. Lastly, this incident could
            have been avoided by electing to use a high-speed drill in lieu of an osteotome to
            resect the IAP. In light of this case, we feel the use of a high-speed drill should
            be strongly considered when resecting bone in areas adjacent to an OLF. We have modified
            our management to reflect these recommendations without further incident.
