         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>We evaluated the features of diabetic retinal and choroidal edema in Spontaneously
            Diabetic Torii (SDT) rats. We measured the retinal and choroidal thicknesses in normal
            Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (
            <i>n</i> = 9) and SDT rats (
            <i>n</i> = 8). The eyes were enucleated 40 weeks later after they were diagnosed with diabetes,
            and 4-micron sections were cut for conventional histopathologic studies. The mean
            retinal and choroidal thicknesses were significantly thicker in the SDT rats than
            in the normal SD rats. The choroidal thickness was correlated strongly with the retinal
            thickness in both rat models. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic choroidopathy
            appeared as edema in the SDT rats. The retinal thickness was correlated strongly with
            the choroidal thickness in the SDT rats, which is an ideal animal model of both DR
            and choroidopathy.

         <title>1. Introduction </title>
         <p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of visual loss and blindness in developed
            countries [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Physicians need to understand the manner in which DR develops and how it can be
            prevented by using animal models of diabetes. With that in mind, an animal model of
            diabetes with ocular complications mimicking human diabetics is needed. Many diabetic
            animal models have been reported. Énzsöly et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>

            </span>] reported that degenerative changes in the photoreceptors and pigment epithelium
            appeared in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Those investigators used male Wistar
            and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and found no significant difference between the retinal
            thicknesses in the normal and diabetic rats. Long-Evans Tokushima Learn rats have
            been used as a model of type 1 diabetes [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">

            </span>]. Pancreatic changes and genetic analysis were discussed in those studies, but ocular
            complications were not mentioned. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats are
            a well-known model of type 2 diabetes. Using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography
            (OCT), Yang et al. [

            </span>] reported that the retinas were significantly thinner in OLETF rats than in normal
            Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats and the tendency was apparent in the retinal nerve
            fiber layer (NFL). Diabetic animal models and their ocular changes in these studies
            are important to the understanding of diabetic ocular complications. However, the
            ocular findings in these models differ from those in humans.
         </p>
         <p>A new spontaneously diabetic strain of the SD rat, the Spontaneously Diabetic Torii
            (SDT) rat, was established in 1997 and the features of the model were reported [

                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Mature diabetic cataracts and proliferative DR (PDR) especially resemble human
            diseases in SDT rats. These remarkable ocular complications do not appear in any other
            animal models of diabetes. We think that SDT rats are the most ideal model of diabetic
            ocular complications, and we used them to examine the effect of ranirestat, a new
            aldose reductase inhibitor, on DR [

               Research and the Jichi Medical University Animal Care and Use Committee. We obtained
               male SDT rats and normal SD rats from CLEA, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). All SDT rats (
               <i>n</i> = 8) were confirmed to be diabetic based on a nonfasting blood glucose concentration
               exceeding 350 mg/dL. The SDT rats were diagnosed with diabetes by 12 to 20 weeks after
               birth. All SDT rats were fed standard rat chow (CRF-1, Oriental Yeast, Inc., Tokyo,
               Japan) for 40 weeks after the onset of diabetes. All normal SD rats (

            <p>Body weight, blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were measured once monthly.
               Blood samples to measure the blood glucose and HbA1c were collected from the tail

               The retinal thickness was defined as the distance between the retinal internal limiting
               membrane (ILM) and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The choroidal thickness was
               defined as the distance between the RPE and the choroidal-scleral junction. In the

               thickness, the outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness, and the photoreceptor layer (PL)
               thickness were calculated. The mean retinal and choroidal thicknesses were measured

         <title>4. Discussion </title>
         <p>In the current study, we evaluated retinal and choroidal edema in SDT rats. Large
            variations in the retinal thicknesses in both the normal SD and SDT rats in this experiment
            were seen and may present individual variations. A previous paper reported that at
            about 70 weeks of age SDT rats had PDR, the pathologic feature characterized by fibrous
            proliferation around the optic nerve disc [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Most of the SDT rats in this experiment were younger than 60 weeks of age, and
            the proliferative changes may appear about 10 weeks later. Retinal hemorrhage, exudates,
            and infiltration of inflammatory cells, which suggests typical nonproliferative diabetic
            retinopathy (NPDR), were not found in this experiment. The blood glucose level was
            extremely high and there was no macular formation in the SDT rat. Metabolic abnormalities
            and retinal morphology in the SDT rat differ from those in humans. Therefore, although
            DR in SDT rat mimics retinopathy in humans, to be precise it differs from that in
            humans. We reported accumulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
            extensive fluorescein leakage around the optic nerve disc in the retinas of SDT rats
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>], and we believe that the thickening in SDT rats is due to increasing retinal vascular
            permeability. Therefore, although typical NPDR in this experiment was not observed,
            we evaluated earlier DR as diabetic retinal edema in this experiment. Because the
            number of animals was limited in this experiment, we did not measure the retinal and
            choroidal thicknesses in SDT rats before the onset of diabetes. However, we reported
            that ranirestat suppressed the retinal thickness in SDT rats and the difference in
            the retinal thickness between the ranirestat-treated SDT rats and the normal SD rats
            was small [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Therefore, the retinal thickness in SDT rats may increase gradually after the onset
            of diabetes. Use of a polarizing microscope in the current study allowed us to observe
            the ILM, ganglion cells, INL, ONL, PL, and RPE in the retina; however, we could not
            distinguish the nerve fiber layer, the inner plexiform layer, or the outer plexiform
            layer from the other layers. A transmission electron microscope may be needed to examine
            more detailed pathologic features than what were apparent in this experiment. Edema
            was seen in each retinal section; no serous retinal detachment or cystoid edema was
            found in the SDT rats. This differs from DME in humans. The choroid in the SDT rats
            was significantly thicker than in the normal SD rats in this experiment. We are unaware
            of any study that mentioned the choroidal thickness in diabetic model rats, but some
            studies have addressed it in patients with DME using enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain-OCT.
            Unsal et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] reported that the choroidal thicknesses in patients with PDR and DME decreased compared
            with healthy individuals. However, in that study, the patients with PDR had a history
            of treatment with panretinal laser photocoagulation (PRP). Kim et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] reported that the choroidal thickness increased significantly as the diabetes progressed
            in severity from moderate-severe non-PDR to untreated PDR. However, in that study,
            the choroid in patients with PDR who had undergone PRP was thinner than that of patients
            with PDR who had not had any laser therapy. Although it is important to examine patients
            with DR under the same conditions, that is, durations of diabetes and DR, long-term
            glycemic control, age, and previous ocular treatment, it is difficult. Patients with
            diabetes often do not know definitively when the diabetes and DR developed, and the
            glycemic control of each patient varies. Therefore, determining whether the choroid
            is thick or thin in patients with DME may not be determined easily. The choroidal
            thickness in the SDT rats, which have almost the same conditions, is significantly
            thicker than in normal SD rats, but this result should not be simply extrapolated
            to patients with DME. SDT rats have no macula, and the retinal edema in SDT rats differs
            from DME in patients with diabetes. The choriocapillaris and choroidal vessels were
            distinct in the SDT rats, and the walls of both structures showed diffuse thickening.
            These findings suggested that a long duration of high blood glucose may affect the
            choroidal structure in SDT rats, but further transmission electron microscopy examinations
            are needed. We reported accumulation of VEGF and extensive fluorescein leakage around
            the optic nerve disc in the retinas of SDT rats [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Therefore, we suppose that the retinal edema results from increasing vascular permeability.
            However, we cannot explain why the choroidal edema appeared clearly in SDT rats in
            the current study. However, we believe that SDT rats are an ideal model of both diabetic
            retinal and choroidal edema. This rat model is expected to be used for investigating
            both DR and choroidopathy in many institutions.
