         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> is a freshwater marine member of the family Enterobacteriaceae which often colonizes
            fish, lizards, snakes, and turtles but is an infrequent human pathogen. Indium-111-
            (
            <sup>111</sup>In-) labeled white blood cell (WBC) scintigraphy is an imaging modality which has
            a wide range of reported sensitivity and specificity (from 60 to 100% and from 68
            to 92%, resp.) for diagnosing acute and chronic infection. We describe a case of suspected
            <i> E. tarda</i> prosthetic aortic valve and mitral valve endocarditis with probable vegetations and
            new mitral regurgitation on transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms which
            was supported with the use of 
            <sup>111</sup>In-labeled WBC scintigraphy.

         <title>1. Case Presentation</title>
         <p>A 68-year-old Caucasian male with prior mechanical prosthetic aortic valve implantation
            in 1995, mitral valve annuloplasty in 2010, and rate-controlled atrial fibrillation
            presented to an outside facility with a chief complaint of fatigue and body aches.
            Upon admission, he was febrile (38.2°C) and had a normal white blood cell count with
            a significant left shift (27% bands) as well as an elevated procalcitonin (38.63 ng/mL).
            He was previously very active, exercising for three hours, three to four times weekly;
            however, he had been feeling ill with fatigue and body aches for two days and spent
            the day prior to presentation lying on a hard ice pack, developing a sacral decubitus
            ulcer. Initial workup and management of his sepsis focused on the ulcer as a source.
            Therefore, blood cultures were drawn and he was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics,
            including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.
         </p>
         <p>On day two of his hospital stay, 2/2 blood cultures drawn 10 hours apart grew
            <i> Edwardsiella tarda</i> which was sensitive to all antibiotics tested allowing refinement of the antibiotic
            regimen to ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. The patient was questioned about possible
            freshwater marine exposure, and he admitted to having a deep puncture wound in his
            hand with a used fish hook about two weeks prior to presentation.
         </p>
         <p>The following five hospital days were complicated by a waxing and waning encephalopathy
            despite defervescence, sterile follow-up blood cultures, and normalization of the
            left shift on complete blood count differential. On hospital day number 7, his atrial
            fibrillation was poorly rate controlled so cardiology was consulted. A transthoracic
            echocardiogram was performed, which showed an echodensity on the mechanical aortic
            valve, concerning for vegetation. With this finding, his family requested his transfer
            to our facility.
         </p>
         <p>Upon arrival to our facility, levofloxacin and ceftriaxone were continued and a transesophageal
            echocardiogram was performed. The prosthetic aortic valve appeared to be well seated.
            The aortic valve leaflets were poorly visualized, but the previously repaired mitral
            valve demonstrated new moderate regurgitation and a vegetation on the anterior leaflet.
            With this rather confusing clinical picture of possible multivalve endocarditis, infectious
            disease and cardiothoracic surgery were consulted. Ultimately, upon discussion with
            the patient and consultants, the decision was made to obtain more information with
            an Indium-111- (
            <sup>111</sup>In-) labeled white blood cell (WBC) scan. This scan was chosen due to availability
            at our facility at the time. The 
            <sup>111</sup>In-labeled WBC scan showed a focal collection of radiotracer labeled white blood cells
            overlying the expected region of the mitral valve, consistent with endocarditis (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>) as well as focal uptake over the sacrum, in the area of the decubitus. The patient
            was not a good candidate for valve surgery as it would be his third sternotomy; therefore,
            he was sent home after a total of 21 days in the hospital on indefinite suppressive
            therapy with levofloxacin. At 6-month follow-up, he has continued this regimen with
            no further complications and has gotten back to his active lifestyle.

         <title>2. Discussion</title>
         <p>
            <i>Edwardsiella tarda</i> is a gram negative, motile, facultatively anaerobic rod which is most commonly isolated
            from freshwater marine organisms. It is not unheard of as a human pathogen, but it
            rarely causes extraintestinal infection [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>

                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. A review of the literature reveals one case report of successfully treated
            <i> E. tarda</i> prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis in a patient with AIDS who had sustained a catfish
            barb injury two weeks before the onset of symptoms [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Other cases have described extraintestinal manifestations including soft tissue
            infection, neonatal sepsis and meningitis, osteomyelitis, and vascular prosthesis
            infection [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Our patient likely developed
            <i> E. tarda</i> bacteremia after puncturing his hand with a used fish hook two weeks prior to presentation.
            The resultant fever, chills, and body aches caused him to lay for a sustained time
            on a hard ice pack, thus creating the sacral decubitus ulcer which was initially thought
            to be the source of infection.
         </p>
         <p>The patient's cardiac anatomy made transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram
            challenging; however, he did meet one major and three minor Duke criteria. To meet
            major criteria, he had a possible vegetation on the prosthetic aortic valve as well
            as a vegetation on the mitral valve with a new mitral valve regurgitant murmur compared
            to his postoperative echocardiogram. To meet minor criteria, he had a fever at admission,
            a prosthetic heart valve, and positive blood cultures not meeting the definition of
            major criteria [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. With one major and three minor criteria, we felt comfortable diagnosing endocarditis;
            however, the patient, a highly educated businessman, wanted further evidence before
            he was willing to accept lifelong suppressive antibiotics.
         </p>
         <p>
            <sup>111</sup>In-labeled WBC scintigraphy for evaluation of endocarditis receives a rating of 3
            for the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, which means it is
            rarely appropriate. The guidelines also state that there are situations where this
            imaging modality can be useful in isolated patients [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Other modalities such as 18F-FDG PET/CT and 99 m Technetium-HMPAO-labeled leukocyte
            SPECT/CT have also been shown as effective imaging options for prosthetic valve endocarditis,
            but both were unavailable at our facility at the time [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>,

               </sup>
            </span>]. Our patient's anatomy provided poor windows for echocardiographic examination and
            although he met Duke criteria to diagnose endocarditis the patient was unwilling to
            accept lifelong suppressive antibiotics without further information. Because of this,
            additional imaging obtained with 
            <sup>111</sup>In-labeled WBC scintigraphy was indispensable for helping the patient understand and
            accept his treatment. Although retrospective case reviews have suggested that 
            <sup>111</sup>In-labeled WBC scans may be useful for patient care less than half the time they are
            ordered, when ordered in a targeted manner, such as this case, they can be very valuable
            [
