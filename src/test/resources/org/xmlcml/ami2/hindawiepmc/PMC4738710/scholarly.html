         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a neurocutaneous syndrome, is characterized by the
            development of benign tumours affecting different body systems. We herein present
            a report of a 40-year-old female patient presenting with dental enamel pits and localized
            gingival overgrowth that eventually lead to the diagnosis of a case of familial TSC.
            Diagnosis of familial TSC by comprehensive oral examination and detection of oral
            manifestations proved to be inevitable as it resulted in institution of appropriate
            treatment strategies and genetic counselling of the affected family.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) shows variable clinical expressivity with oral manifestations
            observed in less than 10% of the cases and familial inheritance pattern perceived
            in only 30% of the cases reported [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>

                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The most commonly noted oral manifestations in TSC are presence of oral fibromas,
            gingival hyperplasia, and enamel hypoplasia in the form of dental enamel pitting.
            This case highlights the importance of oral manifestations in the diagnosis of a case
            of familial TSC.

         <title>2. Case Presentation</title>
         <p>A 40-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Periodontology of King
            George's Medical University, Lucknow, in April 2015, with a chief complaint of painless
            gingival overgrowth in left upper posterior teeth region (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). On further elaboration of her complaint she revealed that initially the overgrowth
            was localized and freely movable. However, in last 6 months, the growth has progressively
            increased in size with involvement of multiple teeth leading to compromised aesthetics
            and poor masticatory efficiency.
         </p>
         <p>On thorough physical examination the propositor did not show any signs or symptoms
            of cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, immune, or musculoskeletal disorders. On
            further elaboration of the medical history, the propositor's elder brother revealed
            occurrence of sporadic epileptic episodes since childhood with eventual reoccurrences
            occasionally which was treated with irregular use of antiseizure drugs. Upon extra
            oral examination some nodular lesions were also seen around the nasal and perinasal
            area. On intraoral examination a localized diffuse gingival overgrowth involving marginal,
            papillary, and attached labial gingiva was seen extending from the left maxillary
            premolar to left maxillary canine. The overlying gingiva was pink, nonerythematous,
            and of semifirm consistency with loss of stippling. Some form of enamel hypoplasia/pitting
            on vestibular surface of upper anterior teeth was also observed which further jeopardized
            her esthetics. The propositor's attendant also gave history of delayed eruption of
            the permanent teeth. The propositor also disclosed that she had been a tobacco chewer
            since her teenage years. Based on the clinical presentation and history of intake
            of antiseizure drugs a provisional diagnosis of drug induced gingival overgrowth was
            made and a tailored treatment plan was constituted which included institution of oral
            hygiene instructions and initiation of phase I periodontal therapy. During second
            recall visit, on reviewing the patient history, the sporadic use of antisiezure drugs
            made us think on the lines of associated syndromic conditions.
         </p>
         <p>On reexamining the patient, the comorbid appearance of small enamel pits (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>) and gingival overgrowth indicated the possible clinical working hypothesis of tuberous
            sclerosis complex (TSC). Comprehensive dermatological examination was performed to
            look for the cutaneous manifestations, if any, to potentiate the clinical diagnosis
            of TSC. Examination by dermatologist revealed presence of nodular lesions in nasal
            and perinasal area which appeared in a characteristic butterfly fashion (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). Further questioning also revealed that other family members of the propositor had
            similar lesions on face and were later on invited to undergo oral and dermatological
            examination to confirm the familial nature of the disease. Six members of the family
            who were in direct blood relation including her father and brother showed ungual lesions,
            hypopigmented macules in perinasal area, and dental enamel pits on upper front teeth.
            The familial findings indicated an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of the disease
            in the present case. To further affirm the diagnosis, the propositor was submitted
            to the imaging analysis. Ultrasonography of abdomen showed viscera to be normal; however
            both the kidneys were poorly visualized. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) of
            whole abdomen showed that both the kidneys were totally replaced by heterogeneous
            mass lesion showing fat components and thick septations. The affection was found to
            be more prominent in the left kidney than in the right one. The renal lesion in left
            side measured approx 18 × 15 cm while right renal mass measured 9 × 7 cm. Only small
            renal parenchyma was appreciated at the lower pole of both the kidneys. A written
            informed consent for the photographs being used was taken from the patient.
         </p>
         <p>Based on the clinical and radiological findings along with the familial inheritance
            pattern the diagnosis of autosomal dominant tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) was established
            consisting of a triad of bilateral renal angiomyolipoma, pancreatic angiomyolipoma,
            and skin angiofibroma along with intraoral findings as gingival overgrowth and enamel
            pits.

         <title>3. Investigations</title>
         <p>Routine haematological investigations were conducted and were found to be within the
            reference range. Imaging analysis included USG and CT scan of whole abdomen. Kidney
            function test was normal and asymptomatic. The urine analysis did not reveal any significant
            finding. Echocardiography (ECG) and fundoscopy examinations were found to be nonsignificant.
            Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not be performed due to financial constraints.
            Oral imaging revealed normal bone morphology as evident by orthopantamograms (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>).

         <title>4. Differential Diagnosis</title>
         <p>Other forms of neurocutaneous syndromes include type 1 and type 2 neurofibromatosis,
            Sturge-Weber syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia and von Hippel Landau disease, and tuberous
            sclerosis complex [

            </span>]. Facial and oral papules/nodules can also be seen in Cowden syndrome, Birt-Hogg-Dube
            syndrome, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type-1 [

         <title>5. Treatment</title>
         <p>During initial treatment visit, gentle scaling and root planing were done along with
            institution of oral hygiene instructions. Plaque control measures lead to the improvement
            in the periodontal status but the lesion did not resolve completely on subsequent
            visits. For the same reason, complete excision till periosteum was planned with surgical
            scalpel under local anaesthesia. An informed written consent was taken from the propositor.
            Under local anesthesia full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was reflected involving
            permanent canine and premolars. Root planing and flap curettage were done and irrigated
            with saline. Flap was repositioned with figure of eight sutures and noneugenol surgical
            periodontal dressing was placed. Postoperative instructions as well as indicated medications
            were prescribed. The excised gingival tissue appeared pale pink and fibrous and did
            not differ from any usual enlarged gingival tissue. Also, the patient has been referred
            to the department of urology for laproscopic examination for diagnosing renal lesions.
            For hamartomatous lesions on face, cosmetic treatments have been advised ranging from
            cryosurgery to lasers.

      <div tagxxx="sec">
         <title>6. Outcome and Follow-Up</title>
         <p>The patient was recalled after 10 days for follow-up. The periodontal dressings were
            removed and healing took place uneventfully. Oral hygiene instructions were reinforced.
            No recurrence has been observed till now. The genetic counselling for the propositor
            and affected family members has been rendered from the Centre for Advanced Research,
            KGMU.

         <title>7. Discussion</title>
         <p>There is a paucity of literature in which the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex
            (TSC) was based on the oral findings; the aim of this case report is to emphasize
            oral manifestations for the diagnosis of familial case of TSC.
         </p>
         <p>TSC or Bourneville's disease (MIM 191100) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder
            affecting multiple organs such as skin, adnexa, CNS, heart, and kidneys [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>

            </span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. TSC was first described by Von Recklinghausen and later by Pringle [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>In this case report the propositor presented with findings of multiple angiofibromatous
            hamartomatous lesions distributed in a butterfly wing-like pattern around malar region,
            infrequent occurrence of seizures and renal and pancreatic angiomyolipomas along with
            enamel pitting, and localized gingival overgrowth. TSC has been associated with epilepsy
            in 90% of cases, with Koenen tumours in 15–20% and angiofibromas in 70% of cases,
            and with renal angiomyolipomas in 50% of the cases [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The extraoral and intraoral findings herein presented are in agreement with the
            clinical diagnostic criteria of TSC (major and minor features) as described by Northrup
            and Krueger in 2013 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However the genetic diagnostic criteria could not be confirmed due to financial
            constraints. The incidence of oral fibromas in TSC cases varies between 50 and 69%
            with an average diameter of 5 mm [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The aggressivity of such oral lesions depends upon the presence of local irritating
            factors. Herein, the gingival overgrowth was carefully excised with the help of scalpel
            after performing phase 1 periodontal therapy. No reoccurrence has been noted till
            6 months follow-up owing to the effectiveness of the treatment. Although gingival
            overgrowth can also be caused by the use of antiseizure drugs as in the present case,
            the pattern of gingival overgrowth induced by antiseizure drug was not found in the
            present case was not found in the present case.
         </p>
         <p>Angiofibromas in TSC have been frequently reported in upper anterior region and rarely
            on lip, tongue, and palate. Enamel pits seen in association with TSC may be associated
            with high risk of dental caries. Less frequent dental findings reported in association
            with TSC include high arched palate, bifid uvula, hare lip and/or cleft palate, delayed
            eruption of teeth, and presence of diastema [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">

                  <a href="#B11">11</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The mutational analysis have also become an additional diagnostic tool for the
            diagnosis of cases of familial TSC. Two disease determining genes have been identified,
            namely, TSC-1 and TSC-2. TSC-1 protein product is hamartin and TSC-2 protein product
            is tuberin. Both of these proteins are involved in cell growth and differentiation
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Till date no studies have found an association between TSC and oral cancer; however
            TSC-2 overexpression may exert antitumor effect due to its oncosuppressor genes [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">13</a>

               </sup>
            </span>]. In the present case the patient had a history of epilepsy and showed cutaneous
            fibromas but the identification of dental enamel pits and gingival overgrowth was
            fundamental in the diagnosis of TSC. The patient acceptance to the treatment was also
            assessed by a 3-point rating scale during the follow-up visit as described by Purwar
            et al. [

            </span>] and the patient rated it with a score of 3 (highly satisfied) on the grounds of
            presurgical, surgical, and postsurgical protocol and cost-effectiveness of the treatment.
         </p>
         <p>This case report illustrates the importance of identification of intraoral findings
            in achieving early diagnosis of TSC which leads to appropriate screening examination,
            treatment, and genetic counselling.
