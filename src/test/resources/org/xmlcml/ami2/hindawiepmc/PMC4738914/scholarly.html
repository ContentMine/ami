         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is a poorly understood, yet common phenomenon widely
            encountered in clinical practice. We present a case of suspected levofloxacin-induced
            thrombocytopenia, a rare side effect of a ubiquitous antibiotic, in a patient without
            similar effect to ciprofloxacin. This report builds upon other isolated case reports
            of fluoroquinolone-induced thrombocytopenia and demonstrates our algorithmic approach
            to the issue as well as a literature review pertaining to fluoroquinolone-induced
            thrombocytopenia.

         <title>1. Case</title>
         <p>An 83-year-old white male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral
            vascular disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and a diabetic foot infection
            with osteomyelitis of his right 5th metatarsal and proximal phalanx presented with
            decreased appetite and nausea. Bone biopsy one month prior to admission grew
            <i> Escherichia coli</i> and the patient was initially treated with 400 mg of oral ciprofloxacin twice daily
            for three weeks. The patient developed gastrointestinal intolerance and was switched
            to oral levofloxacin, 500 mg daily, one week prior to admission, which did not improve
            his gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's review of systems was noncontributory
            aside from stated. The physical exam was notable for a positive probe-to-bone on a
            1 cm-by-1 cm ulcer over the right medial malleolus and a 2 cm-by-1 cm right lateral
            foot ulcer along with decreased sensation over the feet bilaterally.
         </p>
         <p>Laboratory results revealed a platelet count on admission of 128.0 × 10
            <sup>9</sup>/L (150–450 × 10
            <sup>9</sup>/L), down from a count of 480.0 × 10
            <sup>9</sup>/L one week prior to admission (and no previous episodes of thrombocytopenia) at the
            visit where ciprofloxacin was changed to levofloxacin. Peripheral smear showed no
            schistocytes, reduced peripheral platelet count without clumping, and a single anisocyte
            and ovalocyte per high-power field. The white blood cell count was 5.6 × 10
            <sup>9</sup>/L (4.5–11.0 × 10
            <sup>9</sup>/L) with 81.5% neutrophils, hemoglobin 11.0 g/dL (13.5–17.5 g/dL) with a mean corpuscular
            volume of 83.3 fl, and red cell distribution width of 20%. Blood chemistries showed
            sodium of 140 mEq/L (135–145 mEq/L), potassium of 4.0 mEq/L (3.5–5.0 mEq/L), chloride
            of 106 mEq/L (95–105 mEq/L), bicarbonate of 23 mEq/L (22–29 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen
            of 49 mg/dL (7–18 mg/dL), creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL (0.6–1.2 mg/dL) with baseline appearing
            to be 1.2 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 83 mg/dL (70–115 mg/dL). Haptoglobin, lactate
            dehydrogenase, vitamin B12, and folate were normal. Other than the addition of the
            antibiotic, there was no recent changes in his medication.
         </p>
         <p>The differential diagnosis for the patient's thrombocytopenia consisted of dilutional
            effect secondary to fluid resuscitation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), myelodysplastic
            syndrome, splenic sequestration, and other drug-induced thrombocytopenias. During
            the hospital course, the hemoglobin reached a nadir of 9.5 g/d, but stabilized as
            the platelet count continued to trend downward ruling out dilutional effect. An absence
            of schistocytes on peripheral smear made intravascular consumption less likely. An
            ultrasound with no sign of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly decreased the likelihood of
            splenic sequestration. HIT was unlikely due to the fact that the patient reported
            no recent prior exposure to unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin, and this
            was confirmed by a negative HIT antibody panel. Myelodysplastic syndrome was thought
            to be unlikely per hematology consultants. Because of this, our concern for drug-induced
            thrombocytopenia increased.
         </p>
         <p>Hematology consultants introduced the idea that the patient's thrombocytopenia could
            be a result of a drug reaction to the fluoroquinolones. The antibiotic regimen was
            changed from levofloxacin to cefepime on hospital day 4 and the platelets gradually
            rose to 127 × 10
            <sup>9</sup>/L at discharge (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). At three-week postdischarge follow-up, the patients platelets were 391 × 10
            <sup>9</sup>/L and would remain near this level at subsequent follow-up visits.

         <p>We diagnosed this patient with probable fluoroquinolone-induced thrombocytopenia based
            on decrease in platelet count after the introduction of levofloxacin and the improvement
            in platelet count after the removal of this agent.
         </p>
         <p>Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) is a relatively common disorder marked by a moderate-to-severe
            thrombocytopenia and possible signs of spontaneous bleeding that range from ecchymosis
            and petechia to mucosal bleeding to life-threatening spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage

            </span>]. There are several mechanisms for this phenomenon. Certain drugs, particularly chemotherapeutics,
            may cause a predictable or idiopathic myelosuppression that becomes evident at variable
            times after administration. Some medications can cause a peripheral cytopenia, wherein
            the life spans of circulating blood components are shortened with no effect on the
            bone marrow [

            The lowest reported platelet count was 2 × 10

         <p>In a case reporting death, there were no bone marrow abnormalities nor microangiopathy
            noted on autopsy. Examination revealed diffuse petechial hemorrhages suggesting that

         <p>One study reports an in-depth investigation of the development of glycoprotein IIb/GIIIa
            directed antibodies in the serum of their patient with fluoroquinolone-induced thrombocytopenia

            </span>]. The authors drew the hypothesis that the similarities in the structure of the central
            ring of fluoroquinolones and quinine, a known cause of autoimmune thrombocytopenia,
            are responsible for this reaction [

         </p>
         <p>The described phenomenon of a particular fluoroquinolone causing thrombocytopenia
            despite tolerance to another fluoroquinolone has not been described. However, anaphylaxis
            has been reported in a patient after levofloxacin exposure who was otherwise able
            to tolerate full dose oral garenoxacin after skin patch testing showed a reaction

            </span>]. A small trial of patient with hypersensitivity to a single fluoroquinolone showed
            unpredictable and low rates of cross-reactivity between fluoroquinolones but concluded
            that the authors had been the first to show a cross-reactivity between levofloxacin

            in its molecular target of the fluoroquinolone center ring as the IgG reaction proposed
            for fluoroquinolone induced thrombocytopenia.

         <p>Several laboratory tests have been developed to evaluate the presence of markers of
            drug-induced antibodies, but these suffer from poor solubility of certain drugs, need

         <p>Recovery from DIT is variable and based on the amount of bone marrow destruction caused
            by the particular agent. It is recommended that a bone marrow evaluation should be
            undertaken in a patient that requires blood-product administration for their thrombocytopenia
            or myelosuppression. The presence of precursor cells in the bone marrow aspirate is
            a promising sign for a more rapid recovery of cell counts than absence of these cells

            instituted in treatment without increased risk for DIT [

         <title>3. Conclusion</title>
         <p>The above case demonstrates fluoroquinolones as a suspected medication causing DIT
            and also illustrates our algorithmic approach to this issue. Further, tolerance to
            one medication in a class does not confer tolerance to the entire class, as described
            above. It is imperative to rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia and be able to
            employ diagnostic criteria for DIT, especially for nonchemotherapeutic or heparin
            agents, to come to an accurate diagnosis.
