         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Glucagon levels are increasingly being included as endpoints in clinical study design
            and more than 400 current diabetes-related clinical trials have glucagon as an outcome
            measure. The reliability of immune-based technologies used to measure endogenous glucagon
            concentrations is, therefore, important. We studied the ability of immunoassays based
            on four different technologies to detect changes in levels of glucagon under conditions
            where glucagon levels are strongly suppressed. 
            To our surprise, the most advanced technological methods, employing electrochemiluminescence
            or homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) detection, were not capable of detecting
            the suppression induced by a glucose clamp (6 mmol/L) with or without atropine in
            five healthy male participants, whereas a radioimmunoassay and a spectrophotometry-based
            ELISA were. In summary, measurement of glucagon is challenging even when state-of-the-art
            immune-based technologies are used. Clinical researchers using glucagon as outcome
            measures may need to reconsider the validity of their chosen glucagon assay. The current
            study demonstrates that the most advanced approach is not necessarily the best when
            measuring a low-abundant peptide such as glucagon in humans.

         <p>Glucagon, a 29-amino-acid peptide secreted from the pancreatic alpha cells in response

            and brain [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Glucagon has stimulatory effect on hepatic glucose production, and dysregulation
            of its secretion may contribute to the development of diabetes [

            </span>]. Glucagon measurements are, therefore, often an important study outcome; according
            to clinicaltrials.gov, it is included as an endpoint in more than 400 clinical studies.
            However, measurement of glucagon is a delicate matter and the validity of the data
            relies on sufficient specificity and sensitivity of the assay. Differential tissue-specific
            processing of proglucagon results in molecular heterogeneity, meaning that assay specificity
            with respect to the different molecular forms is important. Thus, in addition to glucagon
            itself, proglucagon gives rise to several peptides containing the glucagon sequence,
            including oxyntomodulin, glicentin, and proglucagon 1–61, as well as molecules with
            some sequence homology to glucagon, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
            glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and major proglucagon fragment [

               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Furthermore, each of these molecular forms may occur in extended or truncated forms,
            which may or may not be biologically active [

               </sup>
            </span>]. The immediate specificity problem is therefore of considerable magnitude. Sensitivity
            is equally important, since glucagon occurs in low picomolar concentrations in the
            circulation. Its concentration rises in response to hypoglycemia and falls in response
            to rising glucose (e.g., after carbohydrate meals), with the rate of as well as the
            absolute magnitude of the decrease being of considerable importance for the resulting
            glucose tolerance. The ability of assays to register these decreases from already
            low levels is, therefore, critical [

         <p>In the current study, we investigated assays based on four widely applied immune-based
            technologies: a radioimmunoassay (RIA), a spectrophotometric enzyme-linked immunoassay
            (ELISA), and ELISAs based on electrochemiluminescence (ECL), and homogeneous time-resolved
            fluorescence (HTRF) detection. We hypothesized that the assay type might influence
            measured glucagon concentrations. To address this, we analyzed glucagon levels during
            a glucose clamp with or without atropine (atropine blocks cholinergic signaling through
            the muscarinic receptors and leads to further suppression of glucagon secretion) in
            five healthy male participants using these four different approaches; previous measurements
            indicated that the clamp + atropine protocol resulted in pronounced suppression of
            glucagon levels [

            <h3>2.3. Statistics</h3>
            <p>To analyze changes in glucagon levels over time, a one-way ANOVA for repeated measurements
               followed by a Bonferroni post hoc analysis was performed for each of the four assays.
               To compare the ability of the assays to detect changes in glucagon levels, we created
               a generalized regression model (ANCOVA) with glucagon as dependent variable and time
               (minutes) and method (assay) as independent variables. Net area under the curve (delta
               changes from time zero to 160 minutes relative to the individual baselines) (nAUC)
               was calculated using the trapezoidal rule and differences were tested using a two-sided
               test. A power calculation was made based on the following assumptions: normality of
               data distribution, homoscedasticity, one-sample 
               <i>t</i>-test, quantification limits and coefficient of variations
               <i> provided by the manufacturers</i>, an alpha value of 0.05, and a sample size of five. The calculation showed that the
               power to detect significant changes (of 5%) in glucagon levels ranged from 79% to
               84% across the four assays. 
               <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Calculations were made using GraphPad Prism version

         <title>4. Discussion</title>
         <p>Immune-based detection methods utilize the extreme binding energy of antibodies which
            may have equilibrium constants reaching values of 10
            <sup>12</sup> L/mol, providing these methods with a potential to measure very low concentrations.
            However, the use of antibodies relies on their specificity and the antigen-antibody
            reaction may also may be sensitive to the so-called matrix effects, that is, interference
            from components in plasma including a variety of high-abundant plasma molecules or
            proteins (e.g., albumin and immunoglobulins), leading to unspecific interference in
            antibody-antigen interaction [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Assay D uses the homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence technology which combines
            fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology (FRET) with time-resolved measurement
            (TR) [

            </span>]. HRTF is mainly used in (
            <i>in vitro</i>) primary and secondary screening phases of drug development. However, its usefulness
            in highly sensitive immunoassays required for detection of 1 pmol/L differences in
            glucagon levels may be questioned. In contrast, assay C applies an electrochemiluminescence
            approach: when excited by electrical stimulation, labeled molecules emit light, which
            then is detected by cameras. The most generic ELISA used in our study is assay B,
            involving spectrophotometry detection; a chromogenic substrate is added to sample
            wells, which is then cleaved by an enzyme, for example, horseradish peroxidase, coupled
            to the detection antibody. Assay A is a radioimmunoassay utilizing competition between
            radioactively labeled antigen and unlabeled antigen (peptide standard or sample with
            unknown concentration) for binding to a limited number of specific antibody binding
            sites. Although it is the most simple, with regard to technology, the data clearly
            shows that assays A and B perform significantly better than assays C and D. However,
            a requirement for such a performance is the application of antibodies with sufficient
            binding energy (and specificity), which is often the crucial step in assay development.
         </p>
         <p>In this study, we highlight the crucial importance of choosing the “right” immune-based
            method when analyzing endogenous glucagon. We have exemplified the challenge by demonstrating
            that changes in measured glucagon levels depend on the assay used (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>); where assays A and B clearly register the attenuation of glucagon levels during
            a glucose clamp, assays C and D did not. The basal levels measured were comparable,
            around 15 pmol/L (although assay C showed slightly higher levels, around 20 pmol/L).
            This may reflect a specificity problem in assay C; for example, this assay could be
            cross-reacting with glucagon-like molecules (oxyntomodulin, glicentin, or glucagon-like
            peptide-1 [

            sensitive), and, in another study of other commercially available assays [

               </sup>
            </span>], sensitivity was clearly insufficient to allow analysis in this concentration range.
            In addition, we recently demonstrated that measured glucagon levels in subjects with
            renal dysfunction may erroneously appear elevated, probably due to cross-reactions
            with N-terminal elongated inactive isoforms of the glucagon molecule (1–61) when analyzed
            with conventional single antibody C-terminal radioimmunoassays [

                  <a href="#B13">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Importantly for interpretation of clinical studies, the potential instability of
            glucagon during inappropriate sample preparation and storage, such as multiple freeze-thaw
            cycles or storing plasma samples at room temperature for more than 1 hour, should
            also be considered [

            current mass-spectrometry based methods still depend on 2D-gel extraction techniques
            or bead-coupled antibodies [

            mass-spectrometry based detection methods may involve label-free (be it chemical or
            antibody based) purification steps as recently demonstrated [

         <p>In conclusion, levels of glucagon are increasingly being used as outcome measures
            in clinical trials and the reliability of the glucagon assays employed is therefore
            critical for appropriate interpretation of the data.
