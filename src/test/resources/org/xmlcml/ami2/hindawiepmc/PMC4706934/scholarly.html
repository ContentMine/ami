         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Background and Aim</i>. It is difficult to master the skill of discriminating gastric adenoma from early
            gastric cancer by conventional endoscopy or magnifying endoscopy combined with narrow-band
            imaging, because the colors and morphologies of these neoplasms are occasionally similar.
            We focused on the surrounding gastric mucosa findings in order to determine how to
            discriminate between early gastric cancer and gastric adenoma by analyzing the characteristics
            of the gastric background mucosa. 
            <i>Methods</i>. We retrospectively examined 146 patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection
            for gastric neoplasm between October 2009 and January 2015. The boundary of atrophic
            gastritis was classified endoscopically according to the Kimura-Takemoto classification
            system. Of 146 lesions, 63 early gastric cancers and 21 gastric adenomas were ultimately
            evaluated and assessed. 
            <i>Results</i>. Almost all gastric adenomas were accompanied by open-type gastritis, whereas 47
            and 16 early gastric cancers were accompanied by open-type and closed-type gastritis,
            respectively (
            <i>p</i> = 0.037). 
            <i>Conclusions</i>. The evaluation of the boundary of atrophic gastritis associated with gastric neoplasms
            appears to be useful for discrimination between early gastric cancer and gastric adenoma.
            When gastric neoplasm is present in the context of surrounding localized gastric atrophy,
            gastric cancer is probable but not certain.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>The differential diagnosis of gastric neoplasm as gastric adenoma or early gastric
            cancer is generally made based on the endoscopic findings and pathological findings
            obtained from biopsy samples. Because the colors and morphologies of each neoplasm
            are occasionally similar, it is often difficult to discriminate gastric adenoma from
            early gastric cancer by conventional endoscopy alone. As for the pathological examination,
            it is possible that biopsy samples can be obtained only from the adenomatous part
            of carcinoma in adenoma. Magnifying endoscopy combined with narrow-band imaging (NBI)
            is reported to be useful for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tumors, especially
            early gastric cancers [

                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, it is difficult to master the skill of magnifying endoscopy combined with
            NBI for the differential diagnosis of gastric adenoma and early gastric cancer, and
            this method is therefore not practical for everyday use.
         </p>
         <p>Chronic atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and
            <i> Helicobacter pylori</i> infection are highly associated with gastric neoplasms [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">

                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Some patients with chronic atrophic gastritis caused by a
            <i> Helicobacter pylori</i> infection might progress to gastric neoplasm, and patients with chronic atrophic
            gastritis or
            <i> Helicobacter pylori</i> infection are considered to be at high risk of gastric neoplasm [

            </span>]. It is difficult to master the skill of discriminating gastric adenoma from early
            gastric cancer by conventional endoscopy or magnifying endoscopy combined with narrow-band
            imaging. However, the relationship between gastric adenoma and early gastric cancer
            has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we focused on the surrounding gastric
            mucosa findings in order to determine how to discriminate between early gastric cancer
            and gastric adenoma by analyzing the boundary of the atrophic gastritis.

               by the Mann-Whitney test, and categorical variables were compared by Fisher's exact
               test. Variables that differed significantly (
               <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in the univariate analysis were included in a multivariate analysis based
               on a logistic regression model to identify which ones were independently related to
               the result of therapy. Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software
               SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and a 
               <i>p</i> value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.

            <p>Between October 2009 and January 2015, 146 gastric neoplasms were resected by endoscopic
               submucosal dissection (ESD). Of the 146 gastric neoplasms enrolled in this study,
               3, 41, and 14 were excluded due to the history of partial gastrectomy, previous
               <i> Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication treatment, and unknown history of
               <i> Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication treatment and serum pepsinogen, respectively. A total of 88 gastric neoplasms
               were examined by histopathologists: 67 were diagnosed as early gastric cancer, and
               21 were diagnosed as gastric adenoma. Four gastric neoplasms were excluded based on
               histopathological findings as undifferentiated adenocarcinoma or other malignant tumors,
               for example, carcinoma with lymphoid stroma. Ultimately, 63 early gastric cancers
               and 21 gastric adenomas were evaluated and assessed (

         <p>To differentiate between gastric adenoma and early gastric cancer using C-WLI (conventional
            endoscopy with white-light imaging), both the size and color of the gastric neoplasm
            are useful. Moreover, application of indigo carmine dye also adds some information.
            The size of the adenoma has some impact on the malignant potential: the malignancy
            risk of adenomas smaller than 2 cm in diameter ranges from 1% to 5% but increases
            to more than 50% for larger adenomas [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Red coloration is significantly more common in malignant lesion, but its frequency
            in gastric cancer varied from 60% to 75% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. In gastric neoplasms without red coloration, the microvascular and microsurface
            pattern observed using magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI) is of
            some utility. In addition to the characteristics of the neoplasm itself, we found
            that information about the surrounding gastric mucosa serves as a useful reference
            for differentiating between gastric adenoma and early gastric cancer. All gastric
            neoplasms are accompanied by gastric atrophy; however, the C-type pattern of endoscopic
            gastric atrophy was significantly associated with the probability of early gastric
            cancer.

         <p>Correa proposed an ontogeny of gastric cancer throughout the course of the disease,
            as follows: normal mucosa, superficial gastritis, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia,
            dysplasia, and cancer [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B16">16</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, it is accepted that the adenoma–carcinoma sequence is not a major ontogeny
            of gastric cancer, in contrast to the case of colon cancer, and several reports have
            shown that intestinal metaplasia does not always reflect precancer status [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B17">17</a>

               </sup>
            </span>]. In our analysis, not only early gastric cancer but also gastric adenoma was highly
            associated with intestinal metaplasia, and we did not observe a significant difference
            between gastric adenoma and early gastric cancer in the association with intestinal
            metaplasia. On the other hand, localized gastric atrophy (C-type) of the surrounding
            gastric mucosa was highly associated with early gastric cancer, whereas extensive
            gastric atrophy (O-type) was observed in cases diagnosed with either gastric adenoma
            or early gastric cancer. In other words, gastric cancer is the probable diagnosis
            for gastric neoplasm with localized gastric atrophy (C-type) in the surrounding gastric
            mucosa. Our findings are consistent with a previous report showing that gastric adenoma
            is observed in patients with extensive gastric atrophy, and there is no sign of progression
            to gastric cancer in these cases [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">

         </p>
         <p>This study has some limitations. First, it was a retrospective study performed in
            a single center; therefore, our conclusion should be tested in a well-designed randomized
            controlled prospective study. Second, the study was performed exclusively in Japanese
            patients, and the results may not apply fully to the Western population, in which
            rates of
            <i> Helicobacter pylori</i> infection and atrophic gastritis, as well as levels of gastric acid secretion, may
            differ.
         </p>
         <p>In conclusion, gastric neoplasms are associated with atrophic gastritis. Based on
            the current findings, evaluation of the boundary of atrophic gastritis appears to
            be useful for discriminating between early gastric cancer and gastric adenoma. When
            gastric neoplasm is present in the context of localized gastric atrophy in the surrounding
            tissue, gastric cancer is probable but not certain.
