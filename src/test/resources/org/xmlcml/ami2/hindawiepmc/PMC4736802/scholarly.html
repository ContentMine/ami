         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Introduction</i>. We report a case of ossification of the interosseous membrane (OIM) of the leg in
            a football player who had no history of severe local traumas. A review of the literature
            of the OIM of the leg in athletes was also carried out.
            <i> Case Report</i>. A 38-year-old Caucasian male patient complained of pain on lateral aspect of the
            leg when playing football. Pain progressively worsened until he had to stop the sporting
            activity. Radiographs, and then CT and MRI, showed OIM in the middle third of the
            left leg. MRI showed inflammation of tibia periosteum and bone adjacent to the ossification,
            which was then excised. Two months after surgery the patient returned to play football.
            <i> Conclusion</i>. A thorough analysis of the literature revealed three types of OIM of the leg in
            athletes. Type I usually occurs after a syndesmosis ankle sprain, Type II appears
            to result from a tibia fracture, and Type III, of which only one fully recorded case
            has been published, is probably caused, as in our patient, by repetitive minor traumas
            to the leg. Awareness of the existence of Type III OIM can avoid erroneous diagnoses
            leading to useless investigations and treatments.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Heterotopic ossification consists in bone formation outside the skeleton. The most
            typical form of heterotopic ossification, unrelated to surgical procedures, neurologic
            injuries, or tumors, is myositis ossificans circumscripta, which usually occurs after
            a trauma but can even be initiated by multiple minor injuries or develop spontaneously
            [

            </span>]. Ossification of the interosseous membrane (OIM) of the leg may exhibit some features
            similar to those of myositis ossificans.
         </p>
         <p>We report a case of OIM of the leg in a semiprofessional football player and analyse
            the different imaging, clinical, and pathogenetic features of the various types of
            this condition observed in athletes.

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 38-year-old semiprofessional football player complained of pain in the lateral aspect
            of the left leg of 8-month duration. Initially, he had pain only for few minutes at
            the beginning of games. In the last 4 months, pain lasted for progressively longer
            periods of time until he had to stop playing. In the nonsporting activities there
            was no pain. After a period of rest, he returned to play but had to stop again due
            to persistent discomfort.
         </p>
         <p>The patient had undergone excision of a left-sided L4-L5 disc herniation 4 years before,
            with no residual symptoms except for occasional episodes of back pain. When first
            seen, he reported having had an episode of back pain 1 month before. Physical examination
            showed no evidence of L5 radiculopathy. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
            of the lumbar spine was carried out on the suspicion of a recurrent L4-L5 disc herniation.
            MRI showed mild bulging at the operated on disc, which led to prescribing nonsteroidal
            anti-inflammatory medication for 3 weeks. Electromyography of the lower limbs was
            negative.
         </p>
         <p>When evaluated again, deep palpation on the middle third of the left peroneal muscles
            elicited moderate local pain. Both ipsilateral hip and knee appeared to be normal
            at clinical examination. Radiographs showed a heterotopic ossification in the middle
            third of the leg (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). The patient denied having sustained any severe trauma to the left leg. Computerized
            tomography (CT), performed to better determine the site and extension of the ossification,
            revealed that the lesion was located in the interosseous membrane and started from
            the left fibula but did not reach the lateral aspect of the tibia (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). MRI of the leg showed, on T2-weighted cross-sectional fat saturation sequences,
            a hyperintense signal on both the lateral aspect of the periosteum and lateral part
            of the tibial diaphysis at the level of the ossification (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). These findings indicated edematous changes, suggestive of a local inflammatory
            process that might be related to mechanical stress. The patient refused to undergo
            bone scan. Excision of the ossification was thus scheduled.
         </p>
         <p>At operation, a posterolateral incision was carried out at the level of ossification.
            After longitudinal dissection and posterior retraction of the peroneus longus muscle,
            the fibular shaft was freed of muscle insertions. The tibialis anterior muscle was
            retracted anteriorly paying attention not to injure the interosseous artery and nerve.
            The lamina of heterotopic bone was cut from the fibula, elevated anteriorly to detach
            the insertions of the tibialis posterior muscle from its posterior aspect, and then
            excised. Postoperative radiographs confirmed complete removal of the lesion. Two months
            after surgery the patient returned to sporting activity with no discomfort. At 1-year
            follow-up, radiographs showed no recurrence of the ossification (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>).
         </p>
         <p>The excised specimen consisted of cortical bone arranged in slightly sclerotic trabeculae,
            focally in continuity with fibrous connective tissue. The bone marrow exhibited expanded
            adipose involution and mild fibrosis (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</span>), as it may occur in some cases of myositis ossificans [

         <p>An extensive literature review allowed us to identify three different types of OIM
            of leg in subjects playing sport.
         </p>
         <p>Type I, which is the most frequent, occurs at the distal end of the membrane as a
            result of a syndesmosis ankle sprain [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Overall, 28 cases were recorded, five of which showed a complete tibiofibular synostosis
            [

            </span>]. The latter cases and one with incomplete synostosis [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>

                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Type II was reported in three athletes who had a complete synostosis in the proximal
            or middle third of the membrane [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. In two, showing a large synostosis, the lesion was attributed to stress fracture
            of the tibia, whereas in the third, with a narrower ossification, the etiology was
            related to an old complete tibia fracture. Type III was first recorded in a short
            abstract as “interesting image” [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B11">11</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] providing no information on treatment and evolution of the lesion. The patient was
            a marathon runner with psoriasis who had been treated with a retinoid. The second
            patient [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] was a professional football player in whom the lesion was attributed to stress phenomenon
            to the interosseous membrane and resection of the ossification was performed, however,
            with no histological examination. Our case displayed clinical and imaging features
            completely similar to those of the two previous cases.
         </p>
         <p>Type III OIM of leg has peculiar characteristics compared to the other two types.
            Ossification was located in the middle third of the membrane, started from the fibula
            and did not fuse completely with the tibia, was thin and few centimeters in height,
            and developed in the absence of severe traumas or stress fracture. Pain occurred during
            sporting activity and disappeared with rest and, in few months, progressively worsened.
            Furthermore, several investigations and/or treatments were consistently carried out
            before the correct diagnosis was made.
         </p>
         <p>Pathogenesis of Type III OIM might be explained based on the theory of Chalmers et
            al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">13</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. They postulated that in most heterotopic ossifications three factors are needed
            for the process to occur: an inciting event, usually represented by a trauma, a signal
            from the site of the injury, most likely represented by bone morphogenetic proteins
            secreted by the tissue cells, and an appropriate environment allowing the induction
            of newly formed bone. A possible explanation for the onset of ossification in our
            case, and possibly in the football player reported by James et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>], is that the inciting events were repetitive, minor, direct traumas on the lateral
            aspect of the leg, as often occurs in football players. In the marathon runner the
            inciting factor was presumably represented by the retinoid therapy, which is known
            to expose to heterotopic ossifications in connective tissue of several sites [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">14</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B15">15</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The reason why all three patients had pain during sporting activity might be related
            to micromotion of the ossification, which did not fuse completely with the lateral
            aspect of the tibia, thus producing irritation of the periosteum and bone tissue of
            the lateral tibia. This interpretation is supported, in our case, by MRI findings
            suggesting an inflammatory process possibly dependent on mechanical stress to the
            periosteum and lateral tibia by the ossification.
         </p>
         <p>In our case, surgical excision of the ossification resolved the patient's leg pain
            and allowed him to return to sport with no recurrence of the lesion, as what occurred
            for the patient of James et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>

            </span>].

         <title>4. Conclusion</title>
         <p>Three types of OIM of the leg have been described in athletes. Type I, the most frequent,
            occurs after a syndesmosis ankle sprain or an inversion-internal rotation injury.
            Type II, of which three cases were reported, was attributed to a stress or a complete
            fracture of the tibia. Only two cases of Type III have been reported so far. One of
            the two was the case of a football player, as our patient, who had to stop football
            due to pain in the involved leg. Excision of the ossification led to complete disappearance
            of pain.

         <title>5. Clinical Message</title>
         <p>It is important to be aware of the existence of Type III OIM of leg in athletes to
            avoid the condition to be undiagnosed or misinterpreted with consequent inappropriate
            investigations and treatments.

                  <i>arrow</i>) is in the interosseous membrane. It is in continuity with the fibula but separated
                  from the tibia by a thin nonossified zone. Axial CT scans (b and c) show separation
                  of the ossification (
                  <i>arrows</i>) from lateral border of the tibia.

                  (
