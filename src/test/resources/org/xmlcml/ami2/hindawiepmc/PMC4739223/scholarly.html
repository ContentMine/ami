         <p>Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare, sporadic, complex malformation characterized
            by the clinical triad of capillary malformations (port wine stain), soft tissue and
            bone hypertrophy or occasionally hypotrophy of usually one lower limb, and venous/lymphatic
            malformation [

               </sup>
            </span>]. KTS is a mixed vascular malformation, with predominant capillary, venous, and lymphatic
            components, without significant arteriovenous shunting [

         <title>2. Case Presentation</title>
         <p>A 12-year-old girl came to our emergency department with pain, swelling, deformity
            of right thigh, and being unable to bear weight on same limb following slip and fall.
            She had massive swelling and multiple elevated verrucose-like lesions over thigh,
            the larger ones along medial and lateral aspect of thigh (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Her distal pulses and neurology were intact. Systemic examination revealed no abnormality.
            She had undergone hemiepiphysiodesis of right distal femoral physis and upper tibial
            physis at age of seven years. X-ray of right thigh was taken and it showed fracture
            shaft of femur at distal third with cannulated screws in situ, which were used for
            epiphysiodesis (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>).
         </p>
         <p>Ultrasonography of the thigh was done and it showed venous malformation along whole
            thigh in dermis as well as in muscular planes. Contralateral thigh X-ray was taken
            and obvious differences in bone diameter as well as bone quality were noted.
         </p>
         <p>The patient was kept on upper tibial skeletal traction for two weeks. Swelling gradually
            subsided. X-ray was taken with traction applied over the limb and it revealed about
            15 degrees of valgus and posterior angulation with some callus at fracture site. At
            this time patient was taken for definitive fixation. We did closed reduction under
            fluoroscopy and then immobilization with external fixator. While putting the Schanz
            screws, distal screws were kept without predrilling due to severe osteopenia of bone.
         </p>
         <p>Gradual range of motion exercise and quadriceps strengthening exercises were started
            from third postoperative day. Crutch walking was a bit difficult for her as her right
            limb was about 5 cm longer than the left.
         </p>
         <p>Follow-up X-rays showed good amount of callus (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). External fixator was removed at two and half months and partial weight bearing
            was started two weeks thereafter. The fracture finally united at four and half months
            (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</span>). At final follow-up, at about eight months, she was doing all her daily activities
            independently with knee range of motion of about seventy degrees (15-degree extensor
            deficit and flexion up to 85 degrees) and limb length discrepancy of 5 cm (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</span>).

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome is a very rare condition. It usually affects one limb but
            visceral involvement has also been described. The limb involvement in case of KTS
            is mainly due to venous and/or lymphatic malformation. This causes the soft tissue
            as well as the bone to become hypertrophied and the limb overall is longer than the
            uninvolved side. The skin and muscles contain multiple areas of venous malformation.
            Venous malformation in the medullary canal is also described. The bones are usually
            osteopenic. And these patients have high risk of fall and subsequent fracture of long
            bones [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Management of case of KTS with fracture of involved long bone is very challenging.
            High risk of bleeding and poor quality of bones are two important points to be taken
            into consideration. No definitive guidelines exit in the literature for the management
            of fractures in such cases. There are only few case reports in the English literature
            citing management of fracture in a case of KTS.
         </p>
         <p>Tsaridis et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>

            </span>] have reported the management of fracture shaft of femur in a 42-year-old female
            with intramedullary nail. They had to transfuse 7 units of blood intraoperatively
            and 3 more units in postoperative period. They also reported difficulty with locking
            screw due to profuse bleeding. Nahas et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] also reported fracture shaft of femur in a 21-year-old male. They managed initially
            nonoperatively with plaster cast application. Later they did open reduction and internal
            fixation with locking plate. Fracture showed poor callus at one-month follow-up with
            backing out of implant. They applied LIPUS (low intensity pulsed ultrasound) for 10
            weeks, eight minutes a day after which there was some clinical evidence of union.
            The final follow-up has not been reported as the patient was lost to follow-up. The
            other case as reported by Notarnicola et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] illustrated another very similar fracture but the recovery was overshadowed by severe
            disabling neuropathic pain. This patient also showed complete union of the fracture
            one year after the accident.
         </p>
         <p>In our case, we discussed each and every modality of treatment before finalizing on
            the way we managed. First we were very confident that union would not be problem as
            our patient was a child and some degree of malunion would not do any harm. Elastic
            intramedullary nailing was one option but we were worried about the poor bone quality.
            In such poor bone, inserting the nail may have caused cortical perforation. Open reduction
            and internal fixation with plates and screw did not appear as a good option due to
            the high risk of bleeding. The third option of continuing with traction followed by
            hip spica cast was more suitable to eliminate the complication but then it would be
            very cumbersome for 12-year-old female adolescent. Finally we worked to exploit benefit
            of both the traction and external fixation. We kept the patient on skeletal traction
            for about two weeks. Swelling decreased and good soft callus was formed. This helped
            us to correct the remaining malalignment and then the reduction was secured with external
            fixator. We believe that initial two weeks of traction helped us to achieve gradual
            reduction of the fracture. This helped us to minimize the need of repeated attempt
            of reduction intraoperatively and thus decreased further tissue damage. Use of external
            fixator helped the patient to be free from the cumbersome hip spica cast. We had kept
            reserve of two units of whole blood. Contradictory to previous reported cases, we
            did not have bleeding complication. Skin incisions were given in area free from lesions
            and all further dissections were made bluntly. This may have helped us in avoiding
            bleeding complication. Union progressed as expected. We faced challenges in rehabilitating
            the patient. She had preexisting limb length discrepancy and this caused difficulty
            in crutch mobilization. Knee mobilization was painful and the patient did not cooperate.
            At two-and-half-month follow-up, patient was still not using crutch properly. But
            fracture was healing with good amount of callus. We removed the fixator at this stage
            and kept patient on non-weight bearing for next two weeks. We wanted the patient to
            have good control over crutch walking before she put weight over the injured limb.
            We believe there could be early healing and better knee range of motion if patient
            had rehabilitated well.
         </p>
         <p>To conclude, KTS is rare entity and fracture in such rare case imposes challenges
            to manage. Deviation from the established methods of treatment can help to minimize
            complications but still can give satisfactory result.
