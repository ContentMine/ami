         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Vanadium is a transitional metal with an ability to generate reactive oxygen species
            in the biological system. This work was designed to assess memory deficits in mice
            chronically exposed to vanadium. A total of 132 male BALB/c mice (4 weeks old) were
            used for the experiment and were divided into three major groups of vanadium treated,
            matched controls, and animals exposed to vanadium for three months and thereafter
            vanadium was withdrawn. Animals were tested using Morris water maze and forelimb grip
            test at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. The results showed that animals across the
            groups showed no difference in learning but had significant loss in memory abilities
            after 3 months of vanadium exposure and this trend continued in all vanadium-exposed
            groups relative to the controls. Animals exposed to vanadium for three months recovered
            significantly only 9 months after vanadium withdrawal. There was no significant difference
            in latency to fall in the forelimb grip test between vanadium-exposed groups and the
            controls in all age groups. In conclusion, we have shown that chronic administration
            of vanadium in mice leads to memory deficit which is reversible but only after a long
            period of vanadium withdrawal.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>There has been an increased awareness of accumulating levels of toxic metals in the

            that contain eleven electrons in shell 3 and two electrons in shell 4. This arrangement
            allows for numerous electronic exchange reactions and consequently the formation of
            a wide range of organic and inorganic complexes that contains vanadium in different
            oxidation states [

            <h3>2.1. Animal Design</h3>
            <p>A total of 132 male BALB/c mice (4 weeks old) were used for the experiment which covered
               a period of 12 months. The animals were assigned to one of the following animal groups:
               vanadium- (V-) treated, withdrawal, and control groups. Animal experiments were done
               in accordance with University of Ibadan Ethical Research Committee guidelines for
               use of research animals. V-treated group consisted of four subgroups of twelve separate
               animals each. The subgroups are designated as VAN3, VAN6, VAN9, and VAN12. The mice
               (from 4 weeks old) were injected with 3 mg/kg b.w./day of vanadium (sodium metavanadate),
               i.p. thrice a week for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. After the treatment, the animals in
               each group (
               <i>n</i> = 12) were subjected to behavioral analysis which included test for cognitive and
               memory function by using Morris water maze and forelimb grip strength tests; these
               were carried out on every animal in each group. Withdrawal group consisted of a total
               of three groups of 12 animals each. The subgroups are designated as W3, W6, and W9.
               The mice (from 4 weeks old) were injected with 3 mg/kg b.w./day of vanadium (sodium
               metavanadate), i.p. thrice a week only for the first three months and then vanadium
               administration was stopped. After the treatment, the animals in each group were subjected
               to behavioral analysis which included tests for cognitive and memory function as mentioned
               earlier 3(W3), 6(W6), and 9(W9) months after the vanadium treatment had been withdrawn.
               Control group consisted of four subgroups of twelve different animals each. The subgroups
               are designated as C3, C6, C9, and C12. The mice (from 4 weeks old) were injected with
               sterile water, i.p. thrice a week for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months which was volume matched
               with the V-treated group. After the treatment, the animals were subjected to behavioral
               analysis which included test for cognitive and memory function as mentioned earlier
               in V-treated group.

                  in height) with a hidden circular escape platform (12 cm in diameter) which the mouse
                  must learn its location using contextual and visual cues. This tests hippocampal-dependent
                  spatial learning and memory in rodents [

                     </sup>
                  </span>]. The task is based on the principle that rodents are highly motivated to escape
                  from a water environment by the fastest, most direct route. The pool was marked North,
                  South, East, and West and the hidden platform was placed in a particular spot. Each
                  mouse was dropped into the pool and expected to find the platform, and the length
                  of time it takes to find the platform was recorded. If it did not find the platform
                  after 60 seconds, the mouse was guided to the platform and allowed to stay there for
                  15 seconds. Each mouse went through three trials per day for two consecutive days.
                  This test is a measure of the learning ability of the mouse. On the third day, a single
                  probe trial was given to test the mouse's spatial memory in the water maze while the
                  platform was removed. Its memory of the initial location of the escape platform was
                  tested by measuring the time it spent in the target quadrant and the number of times
                  it crossed the island zone where the platform was initially located. This latter record
                  is a test of its memory ability. The test was recorded manually by two observers using
                  a stopwatch. The Morris water maze was introduced as an instrument with particular
                  sensitivity to the effects of hippocampal lesions in rodents [

         <p>In this study, vanadium administration led to significant loss in memory abilities
            as early as 3 months after exposure and this was consistent till 12 months. Previous
            studies using the Morris water maze have reported reduced memory scores after metal
            exposures. Haider et al. [

            </span>]; however, few have reported on memory deficits using the Morris water maze. In addition,
            our data showed that long term vanadium exposure (3–12 months) leads to significant
            memory deficits which persist long after exposure has stopped. This could have implications
            for people who are occupationally or environmentally exposed to vanadium over a long
            period of time. Of note is the huge population in the Arabian Gulf and Nigerian Niger
            Delta who have been exposed for decades to vanadium-contaminated crude burning in
            relatively confined ecosystem [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">

                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. A striking observation in this study is the significant improvement in memory scores
            observed in mice exposed to vanadium for 3 months after a withdrawal period of 9 months,
            but not earlier. This implies the reversibility of vanadium mediated effects in the
            brain after vanadium withdrawal, despite being only after a long withdrawal period.
            A reversal of tissue damaging effects (not the brain) of vanadium after withdrawal
            has been reported by Olopade et al. [

            </span>] reported that previous benzodiazepine users will likely experience benefits of improved
            cognitive functioning after withdrawal but will not experience full restitution of
            functions; similarly, deficits resulting from vanadium exposure though reversible
            could take a long time before full restitution is obtained. Also, observed in this
            study was the fact that although vanadium exposure led to memory deficits, the ability
            of the mice to learn was largely unaffected. All the groups of mice were capable of
            learning the spatial location of the escape platform, shown by the progressive reduction
            observed in escape latency with subsequent trials. However, in contrast to controls,
            the vanadium-exposed mice were impaired in their ability to remember the escape position
            during the probe trial. Impaired spatial retention of vanadium-exposed mice during
            the probe trials was observed by comparison of annulus crossings over the trained
            position and time spent in trained quadrant. The Morris water maze (MWM) is a test
            of spatial learning which is assessed across repeated trials and reference memory
            which is determined by preference for the platform area when the platform is absent
            (probe trial). There is extensive evidence of its validity as a measure of hippocampal-dependent
            spatial navigation and reference memory [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>] and its specificity as a measure of place learning. Consolidation of memory requires
            a fully functional hippocampus which converts the working/short term memory into long
            term memory [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">

               </sup>
            </span>]. This long term potentiation seems to be the focus of neurological deficit observed
            in vanadium-exposed mice as they showed a significantly reduced ability to consolidate
            the memory of the location of the escape platform. Consolidation of memory is dependent
            on phosphorylation of hippocampal mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK and
            subsequent synaptic plasticity [

            </span>]. Standing on the premises that hippocampal ERK phosphorylation has been shown to
            be required during recent spatial learning and memory, Leon et al. [

            </span>] reported that its inhibition leads to failure of consolidation of memory, though
            it did not affect spatial acquisition. We propose that the deficit in memory consolidation
            observed in vanadium-exposed mice is due to a disruption in this process. Vanadium
            exposure has been found to lead to the loss of dendritic spines and necrotic-like
            cell death in the hippocampus [

            </span>] and this could also be the possible cause. The recovery seen in withdrawal group
            after 9 months could be related to adult neurogenesis or a plastic reorganization
            of neuronal networks compensating for possible early neuronal losses [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">

               </sup>
            </span>]. The forelimb grip test did not show any significant changes in the vanadium-exposed
            animals relative to controls. Though forelimb grip test has shown reduced muscular
            strength after vanadium exposure, the difference was not significant. It seems that
            long term vanadium exposure may not affect muscular activity and coordination to a
            large degree. A human study by Charles et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">
               <sup>

            </span>] did not provide evidence that occupational exposure to pesticides, solvents, and
            metals adversely affected hand-grip strength in the studied population. The histological
            analysis of the different brain regions of these mice is ongoing in our laboratory
            and this will hopefully shed more light on the pathogenesis of memory loss seen in
            this study. In conclusion, we have shown that chronic administration of vanadium in
            mice leads to memory deficits which are reversible only after a long period of vanadium
            withdrawal.
