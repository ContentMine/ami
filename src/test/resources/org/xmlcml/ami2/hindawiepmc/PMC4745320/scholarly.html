         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Acute compartment syndrome is a serious condition requiring immediate medical care.
            A lack of urgent medical treatment can result in serious complications such as loss
            of function and even amputation. While the pathophysiology of acute compartment syndrome
            is well understood, numerous potential causes are still being discovered. A rare cause
            of acute compartment syndrome is IV infiltration. We present a case of acute compartment
            syndrome resulting from intravenous infusion due to proximal placement of a patient
            identification bracelet. We conclude that both routine evaluation for IV infiltration
            and proximal placement of IV lines are essential for prevention of acute compartment
            syndrome.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is the compromise of tissue due to increased pressure
            in the fascial spaces. The increase in pressure in the closed fascial space deteriorates
            capillary perfusion and results in nerve and muscle damage and tissue necrosis [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Acute compartment syndrome is a serious limb threatening condition; if it is not
            recognized and treated early, consequences of ACS will be not only permanent loss
            of function but also limb loss [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Acute compartment syndrome can result from a variety of sources. Common causes
            include closed fractures, crush injuries, increased capillary permeability, and burns
            [

            in minor complications such as minimal swelling or erythema. In severe cases, increase
            in tissue pressures may lead to ACS. This is seen mainly in large fluid or automated
            infusions [

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>An 83-year-old female was brought in by ambulance due to rapid cognitive decline leading
            to decreased oral intake. Her past medical history includes Parkinson's disease, severe
            dementia, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass surgery,
            permanent pacemaker placement, mitral valve replacement, hypertension, and glaucoma.
            The patient's oral intake decreased significantly over a two-week period. During the
            initial assessment, patient was alert, not oriented to person, place, or time, and
            confused. Her neurological exam was also significant for reactive aphasia and inability
            to follow commands. Vital signs were stable. Physical exam showed cachexia, no acute
            distress, bilateral air entry, and soft nontender abdomen with normal bowel sounds.
            No edema or bruising was noted on skin examination. Patient exhibited full range of
            motion. On the second day of admission, patient failed a dysphagia screening and began
            receiving fluid hydration intravenously. A 5% dextrose-0.45% saline infusion was started
            at 10 p.m. that evening at a rate of 100 mL/hour. The IV was checked at midnight,
            and the infusion rate was maintained. At 4 a.m., nursing staff noticed IV line infiltration.
            The patient was then found to have large blisters on the ventral side of her forearm.
            The IV line was immediately removed. On exam, serous blistering of various sizes distributed
            across the skin of the affected right forearm and significant swelling of the soft
            tissue was noted. A rigid nursing home identification bracelet proximal to midforearm
            was identified that was restricting the swelling to the distal forearm (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Her skin was tense from the tips of her fingers to the midforearm with swelling
            visible in her knuckles as well as palmar and volar surfaces of the hand. Patient's
            sensory exam was indeterminate due to her baseline dementia. Her radial pulse was
            palpable. Surgical team was notified for suspected ACS of the forearm and the compartment
            pressures were measured with a Stryker (Kalamazoo, MI) as per the manufacturer's instructions.
            Superior and inferior forearm compartment pressures were between 20 mm Hg and 25 mm Hg;
            lateral and medial volar compartment pressures ranged between 50 mm Hg and 55 mm Hg
            on serial measurements. Given the measurements, diagnosis of ACS of the right hand
            and forearm was confirmed. Lactic acid, myoglobinuria, and kidney function were assessed
            as complications of ACS. All were within normal limits suggesting that no acute kidney
            injury or damage to muscle had occurred. The patient underwent a decompressive fasciotomy
            of the right hand and forearm with carpal tunnel release without complications. The
            fasciotomy immediately softened the hand and improved the motion of the joints. After
            the surgery, the patient was treated with prophylactic antibiotics and the dressing
            was changed daily with silver dressing. Seven days after the surgery, irrigation,
            excision, and debridement closure of forearm wound were performed. A PEG tube was
            placed on day 20 of admission to facilitate feeding. Patient's neurologic and vascular
            function of the affected limb remained intact after surgery.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Normal resting muscular pressure is 0–8 mm Hg [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. A review of the literature reveals that most compartment syndrome cases have pressures
            greater than 30 mm Hg. Once pressure reaches this level, capillary pressure is no
            longer sufficient to maintain microcirculation resulting in ischemic nerve damage
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. While there is no definitive threshold of compartment pressure requiring surgical
            decompression, most clinicians use a compartment pressure greater than 30 mm Hg as
            an indication for decompression in order to maintain blood flow and prevent complications
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">

            </span>]. In our patient superior and inferior forearm compartment pressures were between
            20 mm Hg and 25 mm Hg while lateral and medial volar compartment pressures ranged
            between 50 mm Hg and 55 mm Hg making her an excellent candidate for surgical intervention.
            We believe that a pressure greater than 25 mm Hg should be used for indication of
            fasciotomy [

            </span>]. IV infiltration is a common problem during infusion treatments and can lead to
            rare complications like compartment syndrome. Signs and symptoms of acute compartment
            syndrome include pain, paresthesia (especially loss of two-point discrimination),
            pallor, pulselessness, and restricted mobility of the affected limb [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">

                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Diagnosis of compartment syndrome is based on clinical signs and symptoms. Pediatric
            patients, obtunded patients, and patients under anesthesia are unable to localize
            and express pain. These patients represent a high risk population for IV infiltration.
            Determination of pain, paresthesia, and paralysis are challenging in these groups
            [

            infiltration may be delayed resulting in serious complications such as loss of function

            acid and myoglobinuria can be monitored to assess muscle breakdown and BUN and creatinine
            should be monitored for kidney function. Given our patients inability to express her
            pain and the obstruction caused by her identification bracelet her IV line infiltration

         <title>4. Conclusion</title>
         <p>Acute compartment syndrome is a rare complication of IV infiltration. If it is not
            treated at early stage ACS can result in permanent damage to nerves and vessels. Infusion
            pumps are not designed for sensing IV infiltration. Thus, compartment syndrome may
            happen due to IV infiltration despite the use of properly functioning IV infusion
            pumps [

            </span>]. Our case suggests that, to prevent complications of IV infiltration injury, IV
            lines should be placed proximal to arm bands or bracelets and checked frequently.
            This is especially important in high-risk populations such as pediatrics, patients
            with altered mental status, anesthetized, and obtunded patients. Regular surveillance
            of IV lines in conjunction with proximal placement of lines to patient identification
            bracelets will lead to increased prevention of IV line infiltration and its complications.
