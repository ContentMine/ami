         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Purpose</i>. To evaluate corneal thickness changes during pulsed accelerated corneal cross-linking
            (CXL) for keratoconus using a new isotonic riboflavin formula.
            <i> Methods</i>. In this prospective, interventional, clinical study patients with grades 1-2 keratoconus
            (Amsler-Krumeich classification) underwent pulsed accelerated (30 mW/cm
            <sup>2</sup>) CXL after application of an isotonic riboflavin solution (0.1%) with HPMC for 10
            minutes. Central corneal thickness (CCT) measurements were taken using ultrasound
            pachymetry before and after epithelial removal, after riboflavin soaking, and immediately
            after completion of UVA treatment.
            <i> Results</i>. Twenty eyes of 11 patients (4 males, 7 females) were enrolled. Mean patient age
            was 26 ± 3 (range from 18 to 30 years). No intraoperative or postoperative complications
            were observed in any of the patients. Mean CCT was 507 ± 35 
            <i>μ</i>m (range: 559–459 
            <i>μ</i>m) before and 475 ± 40 
            <i>μ</i>m (range: 535–420 
            <i>μ</i>m) after epithelial removal (
            <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). After 10 minutes of riboflavin instillation, there was a statistically
            significant decrease of CCT by 6.2% from 475 ± 40 
            <i>μ</i>m (range: 535–420 
            <i>μ</i>m) to 446 ± 31 
            <i>μ</i>m (range: 508–400) (
            <i>P</i> &lt; 0.005). There was no other statistically significant change of CCT during UVA irradiation.
            <i> Conclusions</i>. A significant decrease of corneal thickness was demonstrated during the isotonic
            riboflavin with HPMC application while there was no significant change during the
            pulsed accelerated UVA irradiation.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Corneal cross-linking (CXL) is a minimally invasive procedure that combines the use
            of riboflavin and ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation resulting in an increase of the
            biomechanical stability of the corneal tissue [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>

               </sup>
            </span>]. A preoperative corneal thickness of 400 
            <i>μ</i>m as a minimum safety limit to avoid corneal endothelial damage during CXL has been
            proposed [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, endothelial failure has been reported very occasionally after CXL resulting
            in corneal edema postoperatively [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>

                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The etiology of such problems has not been fully elucidated but may be due to severe
            stromal thinning intraoperatively which has been reported by several authors [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>

            </span>]. Hence, it has become important to monitor corneal thickness during the procedure.
         </p>
         <p>Accelerated CXL is based on the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity according to which
            reducing irradiation time and correspondingly increasing irradiation intensity could
            achieve the same photochemical effect.
         </p>
         <p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the intraoperative pachymetric changes during
            CXL using isotonic riboflavin (0.1%) and HPMC (hydroxyl propyl methylcellulose, HPMC;
            VibeX Rapid, Avedro Inc., Waltham, MS, USA) and pulsed accelerated UVA.

         <p>In this prospective, interventional, clinical study patients with grades 1-2 keratoconus
            (Amsler-Krumeich classification) were enrolled. All patients underwent pulsed high
            intensity CXL using the KXL system (Avedro Inc., Waltham, MS, USA) preceded by the
            application of an isotonic riboflavin (0.1%) and HPMC (hydroxyl propyl methylcellulose,
            HPMC; VibeX Rapid, Avedro Inc., Waltham, MS, USA) for 10 minutes at Eye Care Center,
            Maadi, Cairo, Egypt, between August 2014 and February 2015. The study was conducted
            within the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki after obtaining the institutional
            review board approval. A written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
         </p>
         <p>Inclusion criteria were progressive keratoconus (progression was confirmed if there
            was an increase in the 
            <i>K</i>
            <sub>max</sub> on Pentacam maps of 1.00 diopter [D], increase of manifest refraction cylinder of
            1.00 D, or increase of manifest refraction spherical equivalent of 0.50 D over the
            period of one year) and corneal thickness more than 400 
            <i>μ</i>m at the thinnest location. Exclusion criteria were corneal scars or opacities, pregnancy
            or lactation, active anterior segment pathologic features, previous corneal or anterior
            segment surgery, systemic connective tissue disease, atopic syndrome, and dry eye
            syndrome. Preoperative data obtained from the case records included patient age and
            gender, Pentacam central corneal thickness (CCT) and thinnest corneal thickness (TCT)
            values, and CCT values obtained by ultrasonic corneal pachymetry (Sonomed 300P PacScan
            Pachymeter; Escalon Medical Corp.), which takes the mean of 256 measurements in each
            scan.

            <h3>2.1. Surgical Technique</h3>
            <p>Corneal cross-linking (CXL) was conducted under sterile conditions. One drop of pilocarpine
               1% eye drops was instilled 15 minutes before the procedure. After topical application
               of benoxinate hydrochloride 0.4% eye drops (Benox; Eipico Inc., Cairo, Egypt), an
               eye speculum was placed and CCT was measured just before epithelial removal. The probe
               tip of the ultrasonic pachymetry was disinfected using alcohol swab and was held perpendicular
               to the cornea. Three consecutive measurements were obtained at the center of the cornea
               of each eye; the thinnest measurement is used in the statistical analysis. Then, the
               central 8 mm of the corneal epithelium was removed mechanically using a blunt spatula.
               After corneal epithelial removal, CCT was measured. Next, dextran-free riboflavin
               0.1% with hydroxyl propyl methylcellulose (HPMC; VibeX Rapid, Avedro Inc., Waltham,
               MS, USA) was instilled every 2 minutes for 10 minutes after which CCT was remeasured.
               Pulsed accelerated UVA irradiation was next performed using KXL system (Avedro Inc.,
               Waltham, MS, USA) with 1 sec. on/1 sec. off of UVA irradiation of 30 mW/cm
               <sup>2</sup> for a total duration of 8 minutes and 40 seconds. A final CCT measurement was obtained
               immediately after completion of UVA irradiation. A therapeutic contact lens was applied
               and removed at the 3rd postoperative day after complete reepithelialization.

         <title>4. Discussion</title>
         <p>Several studies have already reported the intraoperative corneal thickness changes
            during the CXL procedure using several riboflavin formulas and different UVA settings.
            Most of the studies evaluated the classic Dresden protocol according to which riboflavin-dextran
            solution was applied for 30 minutes followed by 30 minutes of UVA 3 mW/cm
            <sup>2</sup>. Thus, Kymionis et al. reported a 20% decrease in CCT after 30 minutes of riboflavin
            instillation [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Mazzotta and Caragiuli observed 32% decrease after 30 minutes of riboflavin-dextran
            solution instillation; at 10 minutes of the 30-minute instillation procedure the CCT
            decrease was almost 18% [

            </span>]. Hassan et al. showed 23.76% decrease after 15 minutes of riboflavin application

            </span>]. However, Tahzib et al. showed stable CCT values after riboflavin solution instillation,
            which might be attributed to the fact that they removed the eye speculum during riboflavin
            application [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Soeters et al. indicated that avoidance of an eyelid speculum during riboflavin
            instillation resulted in less CCT reduction [

         <p>The use of isotonic riboflavin solution without dextran has been suggested to avoid
            the dehydrating effect of dextran on the corneal stroma. Çinar et al. showed swelling
            of the cornea instead of corneal thinning after 30 minutes of isotonic riboflavin
            solution without dextran during CXL procedure [

               </sup>
            </span>]. In a comparative study, Oltulu et al. evaluated the corneal thickness changes during
            CXL performed with isotonic riboflavin solution with and without dextran; the use
            of riboflavin solution without dextran during CXL caused a steady increase in the
            corneal thickness during the procedure [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Recently, Jain et al. demonstrated no significant decline in the corneal thickness
            after CXL using isotonic riboflavin with HPMC with accelerated CXL [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>In this clinical study, an isotonic dextran-free riboflavin formula with HPMC (HPMC;
            VibeX Rapid, Avedro Inc., Waltham, MS, USA) was used in combination with pulsed accelerated
            UVA using the KXL system (Avedro Inc., Waltham, MS, USA). The addition of HPMC to
            0.1% riboflavin aims to avoid the dehydrating effect of dextran while maintaining
            adequate concentration of riboflavin into the stroma through its viscosity. After
            10 minutes of riboflavin solution instillation, there was a statistically significant
            decrease of CCT by 6.2% (31.95 ± 8.08 
            <i>μ</i>m) from 475 ± 40 
            <i>μ</i>m (range: 535–420

            <i>μ</i>m (range: 508–400 
            <i>μ</i>m). There was no other statistically significant change of the CCT during UVA irradiation.
         </p>
         <p>It seems that there was a lesser reduction of CCT in our study compared to previous
            studies in which riboflavin with dextran was used [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>

               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In the study of Jain et al., no significant difference was found after 20 minutes
            of isotonic riboflavin with HPMC [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. However, they did not perform pachymetry measurement at 10 minutes of the 20-minute
            UVA irradiation process [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">13</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In our study, we performed a 10-minute riboflavin instillation process and a 6.2%
            CCT decrease was measured after 10 minutes of isotonic riboflavin with HPMC instillation.
            In any case, it seems that isotonic riboflavin with HPMC may lead to a significant
            decrease in the corneal thickness during the instillation process of the CXL procedure,
            but less than the decrease reported in previous studies using riboflavin-dextran solution
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Therefore, this riboflavin formula might be actually safer for CXL especially for
            keratoconic patients with borderline preoperative corneal thickness (near to 400 
            <i>μ</i>m).
         </p>
         <p>Potential limitations of the study included the small sample size, the fact that repeated
            central corneal thickness, measured by ultrasound pachymetry, is strongly affected
            by exact centration of the probe on cornea on each measurement, and the fact that
            the gradient of thickness variation is strong particularly in keratoconic corneas.
            Taking into consideration that each scan with the Sonomed 300P pachymeter takes the
            mean of 256 measurements, 3 scans were performed with the thinnest measurement (the
            lowest mean of 256 measurements) in an attempt to respect the safety aspect during
            planning or conduction of the procedure.
         </p>
         <p>Pentacam or AS-OCT is much better for corneal thickness assessment than ultrasound
            pachymetry, especially when a two-dimensional surface is to be analyzed for the thinnest
            point, but in our study, it was not possible to use the Pentacam intraoperatively
            for measurements after epithelial removal, after riboflavin, and after UVA exposure
            as the procedure was performed under aseptic techniques in the operation theater while
            the Pentacam device is not portable. Repeated transfer of the patient between the
            operating theater and the investigation unit was judged not feasible due to patient
            discomfort, the potential risk of contamination, and corneal dehydration.
         </p>
         <p>Preoperative Pentacam CCT values were recorded but were not used instead of the preoperative
            contact pachymetry CCT values to avoid the bias of using one measurement device preoperatively
            and another type of measurement device intraoperatively.
         </p>
         <p>In conclusion, a significant corneal pachymetric decrease was demonstrated after 10
            minutes of isotonic riboflavin with HPMC instillation during pulsed accelerated CXL.
            This decrement was less than the reduction observed in previous studies using riboflavin-dextran
            solution [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. There was no corneal thickness change during pulsed accelerated UVA irradiation.
            These findings suggest that isotonic riboflavin with HPMC might be useful in CXL treatment
            of keratoconic patients with thin corneas. Further randomized controlled trials with
            larger sample sizes are needed to validate these observations.
