         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Primary cardiac tumors are rare and approximately half of them are atrial myxomas.
            They rarely remain asymptomatic, especially if large. The imaging of a myxoma by contrast
            dye during coronary angiography is an infrequent sign, which clarifies the vascular
            supply of the tumor. We report herein an interesting and rare case of a left atrial
            myxoma hypervascularized from the right coronary artery.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Myxomas are benign and the most common cardiac tumors. They are predominantly located
            in the left atrium. The clinical presentation varies according to their localization
            and size. The imaging of such a tumor by contrast media during coronary angiography
            is a rare finding, which displays the vascular supply of the tumor [

            pain due to a left atrial myxoma hypervascularized from the right coronary artery
            (RCA).

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 39-year-old woman, active, presented with a recent four-month history of exertional
            chest pain. There were no previous episodes of myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary
            artery disease or personal or familiar histories of sudden cardiac death.
         </p>
         <p>General physical evaluation showed no significant findings. The chest radiography,
            the resting electrocardiogram, and blood tests showed no relevant alterations. Transthoracic
            and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 27 × 38 mm sessile echodense mass
            attached to the left side of the interatrial septum with mixed hyperechogenic images
            suggesting a necrotic myxomatous tumor. Before the proposed corrective surgery, a
            coronary angiography was performed in order to rule out subclinic coronary artery
            disease. There were no lesions at all. During the selective right coronarography,
            a large amount of contrast media enhanced the tumoral mass (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span> and video 1 in Supplementary Material available online at 
            <div tagxxx="ext-link">http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4865439</div>). Following the pulmonary angiography, during the late left atrial filling by the
            dye contrast, the negative image corresponding to the tumoral mass presence was clearly
            noted (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span> and video 2). During the surgical procedure, the communicating branches of the RCA
            were detected and ligated. The tumoral mass showed a regular and smooth surface. Its
            histopathologic examination showed myxoid degeneration, without calcification, with
            the typical clustered collections of the myxoma cells and intense neovascular structures.
            The patient was discharged home after three days of the surgery, which was completed
            uneventfully. She coursed, however, with postpericardiotomy syndrome, which was managed
            appropriately. At the time of this report, two years after the surgical procedure,
            the patient is asymptomatic, without new adverse events.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Myxomas are the most frequent benign tumors of the heart. Approximately 85% of them
            are located in the left atrium [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Their clinical manifestations vary according to their anatomic position and size.
            There are mainly 3 types of presentations: constitutional, embolic, and obstructive.
            Constitutional symptoms include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, and weight loss.
            Embolic manifestations include stroke, myocardial infarction, and visceral infarctions.
            Obstructive manifestations are usually mistaken as mitral or tricuspid valvar stenosis
            [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Beyond ruling out coronary lesions as preoperative assessment, coronary angiography
            can be useful in diagnosing and evaluating the vascularity of atrial myxomas [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In the majority of cases the source of vascularization is the left circumflex artery
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">

            </span>]. Like in our case, only few patients with left atrial myxoma supplied from the RCA

         <p>Angiographic visualization of the feeding vessels has several clinical and therapeutic
            implications. The detection of these vessels can influence the surgical strategy in
            cases with evidence of blood shunting, due to either spurting from the myxoma surface
            or fistula formation. This can result in a steal phenomenon that will lead many surgeons
            to ligate these feeding vessels during the surgical procedure [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>

         </p>
         <p>Coronary angiography can be valuable in differentiating cardiac myxoma from thrombi,
            which have different therapeutic approaches (surgery and anticoagulation, resp.).
            The presence of neovascularization favors the diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma rather
            than thrombus, which is most often nonvascularized [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Surgical excision is the definitive treatment and should not be delayed especially
            with polypoid types because of the high incidence of embolization. Adequate excision
            of the entire mass prevents recurrence. Regular follow-up by noninvasive methods is
            mandatory for early detection of tumoral recurrence. The mid-term survival is similar
            to that of the age- and sex-matched population [
