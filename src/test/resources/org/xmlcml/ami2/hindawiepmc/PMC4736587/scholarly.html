         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Introduction.</i> Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI) includes several types of early onset diarrhea;
            one of the rare etiologies is trichohepatoenteric (THE) syndrome, also known as syndromic
            diarrhea (SD) which was primarily described by Stankler et al. Hereby we report a
            family with several affected members which to our knowledge is the first case report
            from Iran.
            <i> Report of Cases.</i> A three-year-old boy referred with short stature, poor weight gain, and intermittent
            steatotic diarrhea to our center. He was born to healthy, relative parents (cousins).
            He did not gain any weight after four months of age and began having intermittent
            steatotic diarrhea, abdominal distension, and fever. He was hospitalized several times.
            Two other children in the family also showed somewhat similar symptoms. Two sweat
            tests were negative for cystic fibrosis. Workup for Celiac disease was performed several
            times which was negative; however, gluten-free diet was tried several times which
            was not effective. Workup for Hirschsprung's disease was performed but colon was ganglionic.
            Evidence of liver involvement was approved by elevated liver enzymes and coarse echo
            of liver on sonography.
            <i> Discussion.</i> Trichoenterohepatic syndrome should be put in mind in cases of intractable diarrhea
            presenting in a family with several affected members. Early diagnosis would save patients
            from unnecessary workups.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Diarrhea is a common disease among children and constitutes a major etiology for their
            morbidity and mortality, so understanding different pathologies that cause diarrhea
            is of importance [

            </span>]. Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI) is a term which includes several types of
            early onset diarrhea, one of the rarest is trichohepatoenteric (THE) syndrome, also
            known as syndromic diarrhea (SD). THE syndrome was primarily described by Stankler
            et al. in 1982, in two siblings, presenting with diarrhea, failure to thrive, abnormal
            facies, and unusual hair [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Following reports on other cases revealed similarities in signs and symptoms. The
            most common observed signs are intractable diarrhea, usually starting before six months
            of age, dysmorphic facies such as prominent forehead and cheeks, broad nasal root
            and hypertelorism, abnormal hair, disorders of immune system, intrauterine growth
            retardation, skin abnormalities, and liver function disorders [

            twisted hair (pili torti), aniso- and poikilotrichosis, trichorrhexis nodosa, and
            longitudinal breaks [

         <title>2. Report of the Cases</title>
         <p>A three-year-old boy was born to healthy, related parents (cousins). The pregnancy
            was uneventful and he was born full term, weighing 3.100 kilograms, and 51 cm in height.
            He was breastfed and experienced normal growth for the first 4 months and reached
            5 kilograms. He had poor weight gain afterwards (recent weight: 8.5 Kg) and began
            having intermittent steatotic diarrhea and abdominal distension and was hospitalized
            several times for workup of failure to thrive. As seen in the attached photo facial
            dysmorphism (prominent forehead, broad based nasal bridge, and hypertelorism) is evident
            (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(b)</span>). Hair changes such as woolly and easily removable hair and light coloration were
            evident in our case. Two other children in the family (his cousin a one-year-old girl
            weighing 7 Kg with developmental delay and another cousin a 9-year-old boy weighing
            16 Kg) also showed somewhat similar symptoms (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</span>). Pictures were provided by the family and they were informed about writing of this
            paper and the paper was submitted after their consent for publishing the pictures
            with covered eyes.
         </p>
         <p>Several stool exams were performed and were negative for ova, parasites, white blood
            cells, and red blood cells but were intermittently positive for fat. Stool trypsin
            activity test was normal. Complete blood cell count (CBC) constantly showed microcytic
            anemia. Two sweat tests were negative for cystic fibrosis. Multiple testing for Anti-TTG
            showed variable results (mostly revealed mild elevation). Gluten-free diet was instituted
            several times but was not effective. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing for DQ2
            and DQ8 was negative. Workup for Hirschsprung's disease (due to abdominal distention)
            was performed at 21 months of age, but colon was ganglionic. Thyroid function tests
            were normal. Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) was lower than normal in one occasion
            (7.34 ng/mL, normal: 27.4–113.5 ng/mL). Abdominal sonography at 1.5 years of age showed
            coarse and nonhomogeneous echo of liver. AST and ALT were mildly elevated. Upper gastrointestinal
            endoscopy showed evidence of esophagitis and mild atrophic duodenitis. Biopsy from
            esophagus and mucosa of second part of duodenum was performed. Microscopic examination
            of esophageal mucosa showed moderate esophagitis. In duodenal mucosa, the villi were
            mildly to moderately short in well oriented areas. Focal superficial epithelial changes
            were seen (reduced number of goblet cells, irregularity of lining cells) (Intraepithelial
            lymphocytes: under 10/100). Crypt hyperplasia cannot be assessed; however, crypts
            show marked difference in size, branching, and distortion. There was mild to moderate
            infiltration of lymphoplasma cells and some eosinophils (3–7/100) in lamina propria,
            distorting some of the crypts. No giardia lamblia parasites are seen (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>).
         </p>
         <p>Microscopic examination of hair shafts of the first case revealed aniso- and poikilotrichosis
            with kinking and breakage but no typical trichorrhexis nodosa was seen (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</span>).
         </p>
         <p>Hair changes in cases 2 and 3 are mild and not as prominent as case 1, which denotes
            that spectrum of changes is seen in the family. Also the index patient suffers from
            severe dental problems (caries) leading to loss of most teeth. No skin or cardiac
            involvement is present in patients.
         </p>
         <p>No further workup for liver disease and liver biopsy was performed for the patient.</p>
         <p>The case was consulted with Professor Elizabeth Montgomery (Johns Hopkins School of
            Medicine, USA) and, in light of clinical symptoms (facial dysmorphism, hair anomaly,
            and hepatic involvement along with gastrointestinal symptoms) and affection of several
            family members, diagnosis of trichohepatoenteric syndrome was established. Genetic
            testing is not available yet in Iran. Diagnosis was accepted readily by pediatric
            gastroenterologists and the patient was relieved from further repetitive and time
            consuming workup tests.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Despite high prevalence of diarrhea in children and availability of several tests
            for investigating different etiologies, still in many cases, even with extensive investigations,
            definite diagnosis cannot be reached. Moreover we are yet far from developing a way
            to control the etiology in many cases. Trichoenterohepatic syndrome was first described
            by Stankler et al. in 1982 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Since then several cases have been reported and researchers have concluded that
            the diagnosis is mainly suspected by clinical signs and symptoms such as persistent
            diarrhea, facial dysmorphism, abnormal hair, and involvement of liver. To date the
            confirmatory diagnostic test is sequencing of TTC37 and SKIV2L genes [

            other causes of chronic diarrhea such as tufting enteropathy and congenital microvillus
            atrophy. Treatment of these children is mainly symptom-relieving actions such as parenteral
            nutrition to help with growth, sometimes immunoglobulin supplementation, and, in those
            with severe liver disease, liver transplant [

            </span>]. About half of them show a slight mental retardation, but the main observed complications
            are liver disease and infections. Understanding the genetic defect of the disease
            gives hope to better perception of the pathology of the disease and perhaps a better
            management of patients.
         </p>
         <p>Diagnosis was delayed for several years in our patient and he underwent unnecessary
            workups such as biopsy of colonic wall and testing for celiac disease several times.
            A careful clinical examination and thorough asking about family history (presence
            of affected members, consanguinity) would have helped to reach to a diagnosis sooner
            and save patient from time consuming and invasive workups.
         </p>
         <p>Although genetic testing is the definite diagnostic test, unfortunately it is not
            yet available for this syndrome in our country; however, the symptoms and family history
            leave no doubt about the diagnosis.
         </p>
         <p>Our cases showed no evidence of overt mental retardation which is seen in some cases
            although motor delay was seen in the one-year-old girl mentioned.
