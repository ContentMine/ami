         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Aim</i>. This study aimed to assess the role of echocardiography as a diagnostic tool in
            evaluating syncope patients with normal versus abnormal electrocardiogram.
            <i> Methods</i>. We conducted a retrospective study of 468 patients who were admitted with syncope
            in 2011 at St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center, Paterson, NJ. Hospital records and
            patient charts, including initial emergency room history and physical, were carefully
            reviewed. Patients were separated into normal versus abnormal electrocardiogram groups
            and then further divided as normal versus abnormal echocardiogram groups. Causes of
            syncope were extrapolated after reviewing all test results and records of consultations.
            <i> Results</i>. Three hundred twelve of the total patients (68.6%) had normal ECG. Two-thirds of
            those patients had echocardiograms; 11 patients (5.7%) had abnormal echo results.
            Of the aforementioned patients, three patients had previous documented history of
            severe aortic stenosis on prior echocardiograms. The remaining eight had abnormal
            but nondiagnostic echocardiographic findings. Echocardiography was done in 93 of 147
            patients with abnormal ECG (63.2%). Echo was abnormal in 27 patients (29%), and the
            findings were diagnostic in 6.5% patients.
            <i> Conclusions</i>. This study demonstrates that echocardiogram was not helpful in establishing a diagnosis
            of syncope in patients with normal ECG and normal physical examination.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Syncope, a common clinical syndrome, is characterized by transient loss of consciousness
            and postural tone caused by brief global cerebral hypoperfusion from decreased cardiac
            output and/or peripheral resistance. It is of rapid onset, brief duration, and spontaneous
            and complete recovery. Syncope accounts for about 1% of all hospital admissions and
            3% emergency department visits and annually costs approximately $2 billion in the
            United States [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Causes of syncope are vast and often present as a diagnostic challenge for physicians,
            resulting in extensive workup. The causes could be vascular, cardiac, neurologic,
            metabolic, psychologic, and finally of unknown origin. As per Linzer et al., the most
            common causes for syncope are unknown origin (34%), vasovagal and orthostatic hypotension
            (26%), and arrhythmias (14%) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">

                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Several guidelines exist to assist physicians approach the evaluation of syncope
            in an algorithmic way [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Echocardiography (Echo) is a common imaging modality used in the workup of patients
            presenting with syncope. According to American College of Cardiology 2011 Appropriate
            Use Criteria for Echocardiography, echo is not necessary in patients with lightheadedness
            and/or presyncope who do not have history of cardiac disease. However, in syncope
            patients who have no previous heart disease, the use of echocardiography as one of
            the diagnostic tools is still appropriate [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In 1995, Recchia and Barzilai conducted a retrospective review at an urban university
            hospital. They considered the following ECG changes as significant: Q waves suggesting
            prior myocardial infarcts, bundle branch block, ventricular ectopy or arrhythmia,
            and Mobitz II or higher degrees of atrioventricular nodal block. From chart review
            of 128 syncope patients, more than 60% of the patients underwent echocardiography
            and more than half the results were normal. No echo reports showed unsuspected causes
            of syncope. They concluded that echocardiogram did not add to any additional diagnostic
            value for patients without suspected cardiac disease [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Another retrospective study of 323 patients by Anderson et al. in 2012 suggested
            that echo may be a poor utilization of resources for patients with normal ECG due
            to very low yield of structural heart disease in such patients. Eighty-eight percent
            of the 267 patients with normal ECG had echocardiogram done to evaluate cardiac structure.
            However, none showed structural abnormality [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Echocardiography seems to have over time become a routine test ordered to assess a
            wide array of cardiac diseases. Several studies have shown that echocardiogram has
            been performed in more than half of the patients with complaints of syncope [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>

            </span>]. We suggest that the most important diagnostic tool in evaluation of syncope is
            a detailed history and physical exam. The primary objective of our study was to determine
            the diagnostic yield of echo in patients presenting with syncope, particularly in
            those with normal electrocardiogram and physical exam not suggestive of cardiac disease.

         <title>2. Methods</title>
         <p>This is a retrospective, observational study at St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center,
            a quaternary academic care and state-designated trauma center in Paterson, New Jersey.
            Data were collected through a retrospective chart review of all adult patients admitted
            for syncope during a 12-month period from January 2011 to December 2011. Cases were
            identified based on the initial diagnosis made by physician on admission. We collected
            and reviewed the following data from medical charts and electronic medical records:
            history of presenting illness and associated symptoms, demographic data, medical history,
            and results of ECG and echocardiogram.
         </p>
         <p>The initial ECG was performed on admission. We defined abnormal ECG and echo as the
            following (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
            </span>). ECGs showing arrhythmias, Q waves, ischemic changes, 2nd- and 3rd-degree AV block,
            paced rhythm, QTc &gt; 500 ms, left bundle branch block, bifascicular block, Brugada
            pattern, and abnormal axis were considered abnormal. All echocardiograms were performed
            by registered diagnostic sonographers. Echocardiograms demonstrating ejection fraction
            less than 45%, any severe valvular abnormalities, severe ventricular wall hypertrophy,
            septal wall motion abnormality, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction,
            severe pulmonary hypertension, and hemodynamically significant pericardial effusions
            were considered abnormal.
         </p>
         <p>Both ECG and echo reports were read and approved by an attending cardiologist. The
            reports were then reviewed by investigators.
         </p>
         <p>Initial history and physical exam in the emergency room and the results of all diagnostic
            tests and records of all consultations were reviewed. The final cause of syncope was
            assigned after careful review of all physicians' notes and test results. We looked
            to see the number of patients admitted with syncope who had ECG and echocardiogram
            and the number of patients who had abnormal ECG and/or abnormal echo.

      </div>
      <div tagxxx="sec">
         <title>3. Results</title>
         <p>Out of the 468 patients, we had 321 patients (68.6%) with normal ECG. One hundred
            ninety-two echocardiograms (59.8%) were done in patients with normal ECG reading (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Of those, 11 patients (5.7%) had abnormal TTE. However, 3 patients had prior documented
            echo results and history and physical findings of severe aortic stenosis. Discharge
            diagnoses were orthostatic hypotension and unknown causes. In comparison, in the group
            of 147 patients (31.4%) with abnormal ECG, 93 echocardiograms (63.2%) were done, and
            27 of them (29%) were abnormal. However, the finding of structural abnormalities on
            echo does not establish the cause for the patient's syncopal episode.
         </p>
         <p>Echocardiogram by itself did not help in determining the cause of syncope in any patient
            in normal ECG group. Three of the eleven patients with abnormal echocardiograms had
            prior documentation of severe aortic stenosis. The other eight patients, which are
            4% of the patients with normal ECG with abnormal TTE, had abnormal echo findings showing
            reduced LVEF less than 45% or other nonaortic valvular pathology. Two patients had
            vasovagal response; one patient had orthostatic hypotension. Five patients had unknown
            cause upon chart review (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab2">
               <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>
            </span>). However, echo did not help in establishing diagnosis in any of those patients.
         </p>
         <p>Of the abnormal echocardiograms in the abnormal ECG group, besides the nondiagnostic
            findings, there were one patient with severe pulmonary hypertension, two patients
            with significant pericardial effusions, one patient with severe aortic stenosis, one
            patient with significant septal motion abnormality, and one with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
            Those are all diagnostic causes of syncope (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab2">
               <a href="#tab2">Table 2</a>
            </span>). Hence, in the abnormal ECG group, echo aided in the diagnosis in 6.5% patients
            (6 out of 93).
         </p>
         <p>In patients with TTE performed, nonspecific causes, vasovagal response, and orthostatic
            hypotension all together comprise 91.6% and 68.8% of the discharge diagnosis in normal
            ECG and abnormal ECG groups, respectively (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab3">
               <a href="#tab3">Table 3</a>
            </span>).
         </p>
         <p>In the normal ECG group, the six patients found to have arrhythmia (i.e., paroxysmal
            atrial fibrillation) or conduction disease (i.e., sinus node dysfunction and severe
            His-Purkinje conduction disease) as possible causes of their syncopal episode, echocardiogram
            did not show significant cardiac structural abnormalities.

         <title>4. Discussion</title>
         <p>In clinical practice, echocardiography has become one of the most routinely ordered
            modalities for assessing the cause of presyncope and syncope. Recchia and Barzilai
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] found that echocardiography was performed in more than half of the patients with
            complaints of syncope but no finding had any diagnostic value. Several studies have
            shown that younger patients, patients with no significant cardiac history, have low
            echocardiographic yield. Panther et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">13</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] demonstrated in a 7-year retrospective study of 439 patients, who were referred
            for echocardiographic studies in evaluation of syncope, patients younger than 40 years
            of age with syncope will most likely have normal echocardiography. In age groups 40–59
            and 60+, 58.2% and 29.6% had normal echocardiographic findings. In a prospective,
            observational study done by Sarasin et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">14</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] in 2002, 155 of 650 patients (23%) presented with syncope without clear cause. Routine
            echocardiography showed no diagnostic cause to explain the event. In patients without
            significant cardiac history or abnormal ECG, echocardiography was nondiagnostic or
            normal. Thirteen percent of the patients had positive cardiac history or abnormal
            ECG but echocardiogram only showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction or minor
            nonrelevant findings. They concluded that echocardiography was most useful when its
            use was restricted to high-risk patients with significant history of cardiac disease
            and ECG abnormalities.
         </p>
         <p>Results of our study prove that echocardiogram has a low overall diagnostic yield
            in syncope patients without a history of cardiac structural disease. Eleven patients
            with normal ECG (5.7%) had abnormal TTE. Three of those already had previous documentation
            of severe aortic stenosis on prior history and physical exam and echocardiograms.
            Remaining eight patients' echocardiogram did not uncover any intracardiac abnormality
            to have caused the syncopal episode. Hence the diagnostic value of echo in patients
            with normal ECG and normal physical exam was 0%. For patients with abnormal ECG, echo
            aided in diagnosis in 6.5% patients. Majority of the patients from either group had
            discharge diagnosis as syncope due to nonspecific or undetermined causes.
         </p>
         <p>In agreement with other similar studies, we reason that echocardiography should not
            be routinely used in patients presenting with syncope particularly in those with normal
            ECG and physical exam not suggestive of cardiac disease. Echocardiogram on every patient
            that comes with complaints of syncope is not cost effective.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div tagxxx="sec">
         <title>5. Limitations</title>
         <p>For one, this is a retrospective study. We do not know the outcomes of the patients
            after their discharge. Second, 129 of the 321 patients (40%) from the normal ECG group
            did not have an echocardiogram done on that admission. If echocardiogram was done,
            the percentage of abnormal finding may be higher. Third, we depended on emergency
            room records for the initial history and physical examination. Details could have
            been missed. Reviewing of the charts further strengthens the call for more detailed
            history and physical exam upon initial contact of patients.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div tagxxx="sec">
         <title>6. Conclusions</title>
         <p>Echocardiography should not be a routine diagnostic tool used to elucidate causes
            of syncope unless causes were unexplained by history and physical exam and patients
            have significant cardiac history with abnormal ECG.
