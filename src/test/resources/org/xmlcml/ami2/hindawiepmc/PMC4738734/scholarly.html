         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Anomalous origination of coronary artery from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) is a rare
            coronary artery anomaly. Right ACAOS with interarterial course is a type of ACAOS,
            which conveys a high risk for myocardial ischemia or sudden death. We reported a case
            of right ACAOS with interarterial course in otherwise healthy young male. He was asymptomatic,
            until an obligatory medical check-up with treadmill test showed a sign of positive
            ischemic response. Further work-up revealed that he had right ACAOS with interarterial
            course. Watchful observation was applied to him, while strenuous physical activity
            and competitive sport were absolutely prohibited.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Anomalous origination of coronary artery from the opposite sinus (ACAOS) is an uncommon
            coronary anomaly. Its incidence is reported to be around 1.07% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. It comprises anomaly of right coronary artery originated from left sinus (right
            ACAOS) and its opposite or left ACAOS. The incidence of right ACAOS is between 0.12%
            and 0.92% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Both right and left ACAOS have significant clinical consequence if the ectopic
            artery has an interarterial course or intramural intussusception [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Myocardial ischemia is clinical symptoms and signs frequently associated with ACAOS
            with interarterial course. A constant relationship is observed between left ACAOS
            and sudden death or ischemia during extreme exercise [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Right ACAOS with an interarterial course is a type of ACAOS which poses high risk
            for myocardial ischemia or sudden death as well [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, most ACAOS does not reveal signs and symptoms; therefore the diagnosis
            is often found in postmortem autopsy. We described a case of asymptomatic young male
            who underwent treadmill test for obligatory medical check-up and the result showed
            a positive ischemic response. Further investigation revealed that he suffered from
            right ACAOS with an interarterial course.

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 28-year-old male was referred to cardiology unit of our hospital from a general
            practitioner due to positive ischemic response on treadmill test during his obligatory
            medical check-up. He underwent medical check-up as an obligation related to his career.
            The result of Bruce-method treadmill test was positive ischemic response, good physical
            fitness, and aerobic capacity of 14.37 Mets (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). During treadmill test, the patient did not complain of chest pain; however his
            electrocardiogram showed horizontal ST depression indicating myocardial ischemia.
            Anamnesis revealed no history of chest pain, dyspnea on effort, dyspnea at rest, syncope,
            palpitation at rest, and palpitation on activity. The patient had no family history
            of sudden death or similar abnormality. Physical examination was within normal limit.
            Laboratory examination showed normal value. Electrocardiogram at rest indicated sinus
            rhythm without sign of ischemia (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>).
         </p>
         <p>A noninvasive examination was performed with echocardiography. Transthorax echocardiogram
            showed normal cardiac chamber dimension, normal right ventricle and left ventricle
            wall thickness, normal left and right ventricle systolic and diastolic function, and
            normal left ventricular segmental and global wall motion. Mitral valve and tricuspid
            valve were anatomically and functionally normal. Aortic valve examination showed three
            cusps with normal anatomy and function. Ostium of left coronary artery (LCA) was apparent
            with diameter of 5 mm, whereas ostium of right coronary artery (RCA) was absent.
         </p>
         <p>Coronary angiography was performed for the patient, started by cannulation into ostium
            of LCA with Tiger 6 F catheter via radial access. An LCAgraph by contrast agent showed
            normal left main (LM), normal left anterior descendent (LAD), and left circumflexus
            (LCx). On LCAgraph view of RAO 20 Caudal 20 and LAO 30 Cranial 15, an RCA was originated
            from left sinus near LM and coursed through the right aspect of heart (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). The caliber of RCA was small with normal bifurcation. Posterior descending artery
            was filled from LCx (left dominance).
         </p>
         <p>The confirmation by cardiac multi slice CT (cMSCT) scan showed that RCA originated
            from left sinus of Valsalva with interarterial course between ascending aorta and
            pulmonary artery. The caliber of RCA was small with no sign of stenosis in the RCA
            (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</span>). The small RCA runs through right atrioventricular sulcus and vascularized the right
            part of the heart. The proximal part of RCA passed through ascending aorta and pulmonary
            artery.
         </p>
         <p>Based on the diagnostic work-up, the patient was diagnosed as right ACAOS with interarterial
            course. The evidence of myocardial ischemia, as depicted by positive ischemic response
            on treadmill test, was evident in the exercise electrocardiogram of this patient although
            asymptomatic. Right ACAOS with interarterial course was responsible for the ischemia
            sign. No other structural cardiac abnormalities were found in the patient; therefore
            the coronary anomaly was the most likely etiology of the ischemia sign. After in-depth
            consultation about the prognostic implication of this anomaly, the patient and family
            decided that surgical correction was not to be done then. Therefore, in this patient,
            conservative management was employed. Watchful observation was applied to the patient,
            while strenuous physical activity and competitive sport were absolutely prohibited.
            Beta blocker as needed was given to the patient. During eight-month follow-up after
            the diagnosis, the patient reported no ischemic symptom during regular activity. He
            never took beta blocker medication then.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>We report a case of 28-year-old male who suffered from right ACAOS with interarterial
            course and the sign of myocardial ischemia. Close observation and limitation of strenuous
            activity were advised. Neither medication nor surgical revascularization was applied
            to the patient. Eight-month follow-up of this patient was uneventful.
         </p>
         <p>Coronary artery anomaly is an uncommon condition with prevalence on coronary angiography
            between 0.61% and 5.64% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The incidence of right ACAOS from coronary angiography is between 0.12% and 0.92%
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Right ACAOS with interarterial course is a group of ACAOS with high risk for developing
            myocardial ischemia and sudden death [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Close and reliable relationship is observed between left ACAOS and the incidence
            of sudden death and ischemia during strenuous physical activity [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The clinical picture of ACAOS can be divided into two spectra: the first is sudden
            death in the young and after strenuous physical activity or sport and the second is
            atypical clinical picture [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Most of ACAOS patients are asymptomatic. Atypical chest discomfort is the most
            prevalent symptom urging patients to refer to the health facility and to perform the
            coronary angiography to detect ACAOS. Some patients come due to positive stress test
            or sign of ischemic heart disease on ECG [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In this case, patient was referred due to positive stress test without any ischemic
            symptoms previously.
         </p>
         <p>Clinical implication of coronary artery anomaly can be divided into ischemic and nonischemic.
            Ischemic implication can be fixed or episodic ischemia [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Right ACAOS with interarterial course is associated with episodic myocardial ischemia.
            Interarterial course means that ectopic coronary artery runs through two big vessels
            arising from ventricle, that is, aorta and pulmonary artery. Three mechanisms are
            proposed regarding the proneness of right ACAOS with interarterial course to develop
            ischemia or sudden death, that is, sharp angulation and kinking of coronary artery
            while running off from the opposite sinus, valve-like mechanism causing acute closure
            in the slit-like coronary artery ostium, and compression of narrowed segment of coronary
            artery by aorta or pulmonary artery particularly during strenuous activity [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Hard activity causes dilatation of aortic root and pulmonary trunk which compresses
            slit-like ostium or particular segment of ectopic coronary artery. This occurs especially
            in individuals with sufficient aortic distensibility, such as in young people or sportsmen
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In our case, the patient was still young and without any complaints during daily
            activity and regular excercise. Ischemic sign appeared in the treadmill test marked
            by down-slopping and horizontal ST-depression in stage 4 Bruce-method treadmill test.
            We speculated that compression of RCA by big vessels was responsible for the ischemic
            sign.
         </p>
         <p>However, the unusual thing about this case is the fact that the RCA was not a dominant
            vessel because, based on angiogram and cMSCT, the PDA aroused from LCx. In most cases
            reported with ischemic symptoms associated with right ACAOS, the RCA is a dominant
            vessel; therefore obstruction of this vessel produces significant myocardial ischemia.
            Echocardiogram of the patient showed no other signs of structural cardiac abnormality;
            therefore the most likely source of ischemia was intramural course of the RCA anomaly.
            The left dominance nature of the patient prevented, so far, fatal ischemia. Furthermore,
            the caliber of anomalous RCA, which was small, may also account for the significant
            ischemic ECG changes developed during excercise test.
         </p>
         <p>Treatment modalities for right ACAOS with signs and symptoms of ischemia are watchful
            observation and drugs and coronary angioplasty with stent and corrective surgery [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The goal of right ACAOS treatment is to prevent sudden death and improve quality
            of life [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In this patient, after being given several alternatives treatment modalities, watchful
            observation was selected by the patient and his family. Restriction of strenuous activity
            and competitive sport was encouraged since these may cause ischemic myocardial or
            sudden death. Maron and Zipes (2005) stated that right ACAOS patients without intervention
            should not involve in competitive sport and hard physical activity [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The report of close observation and medication with beta blocker within 2 and 5
            years in ACAOS results in zero sudden death [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">

                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The ACC/AHA guideline in 2008 stated that conservative approach is reasonable in
            right ACAOS without evidence of ischemia [

            </span>]. However, since in this patient the evidence of ischemia was present, surgical coronary
