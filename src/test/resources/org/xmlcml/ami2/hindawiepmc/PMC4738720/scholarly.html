         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after lung transplantation is associated with increased
            risk for pneumonitis and bronchiolitis obliterans as well as allograft rejection and
            opportunistic infections. Ganciclovir is the mainstay of prophylaxis and treatment
            but CMV infections can be unresponsive. Apart from direct antiviral drugs, CMV immunoglobulin
            (CMVIG) preparations may be considered but are only licensed for prophylaxis. A CMV-seronegative
            42-year-old man with cystic fibrosis received a lung from a CMV-seropositive donor.
            Intravenous ganciclovir prophylaxis was delayed until day 12 due to acute postoperative
            renal failure and was accompanied by five doses of CMVIG (10 g). By day 16, CMV-DNA
            was detectable and rising; CMV-specific T-cells were undetectable. Switch from ganciclovir
            to foscarnet prompted a transient decrease in CMV viral load, but after increasing
            again to reach 3600 copies/mL foscarnet was changed to intravenous cidofovir and CMVIG
            was restarted. CMV load continued to fluctuate and declined slowly, whereas CMV-specific
            T-cells were detected five months later and increased thereafter. At last follow-up,
            the patient was in very good clinical condition with no evidence of bronchiolitis
            obliterans. No side effects of this treatment were observed. In this hard-to-treat
            case, the combination of cidofovir with off-label use of CMVIG contributed to a successful
            outcome.

         <p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important clinical concern after all types of
            solid organ transplantation, but the highest rates of CMV infection and CMV disease
            are seen in lung and heart-lung transplant patients [

            </span>]. Tissue-invasive CMV disease can affect various organ systems to cause severe and
            frequently fatal symptoms, but in lung transplant recipients pneumonitis is the most
            feared complication. CMV infection or CMV pneumonitis also increases the risk of bronchiolitis
            obliterans syndrome (BOS) after lung transplantation [

            used off-label in this setting), is introduced according to the sensitivity of the
            responsible strain of CMV although again a response is by no means certain and intolerance

         <p>CMV immunoglobulin (CMVIG) preparations are licensed for the prophylaxis of CMV infection
            and disease and are used by approximately a third of lung transplant centers for prophylaxis
            in high-risk (CMV-negative recipient/CMV-positive donor [R−/D+]) transplant procedures

            </span>], although well-designed studies to assess its effectiveness in the setting of lung
            transplantation are lacking. CMVIG acts in a complementary manner to antiviral therapy.
            While the passive CMV-specific immunity provided by CMVIG administration eliminates
            circulating CMV particles via opsonization and phagocytosis, antiviral agents block
            intracellular viral replication by inhibiting DNA polymerase. Antiviral drugs thus
            exert a direct effect on viral replication, whereas CMVIG may contribute to decreased
            entry of CMV into the cell. There is therefore a rationale to use CMVIG as adjunct
            therapy for CMV viremia or CMV disease which proves unresponsive to conventional antiviral
            monotherapy. International guidelines state that CMVIG therapy can be considered to
            treat severe cases of CMV disease such as pneumonitis but emphasize that more evidence
            is required [

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 42-year-old man with cystic fibrosis underwent lung transplantation on 1 June 2009
            at the Saarland University Medical Center in Homburg, Germany. He had been on home
            ventilation via tracheostomy since February 2009 due to respiratory failure. The patient
            was CMV-seronegative and received a graft from a CMV-seropositive donor. Two 20 mg
            doses of basiliximab (Simulect, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) were given
            on days 0 and 4 after transplant. Maintenance immunosuppression comprised tacrolimus
            (Prograf, Astellas Pharma Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with azathioprine and prednisolone.
            The patient did not experience any acute rejection during follow-up and no antirejection
            therapy was required.
         </p>
         <p>Two hours after transplantation, severe bleeding occurred. A rethoracotomy for bleeding
            control was necessary and the patient needed transfusions of thrombocytes, fresh frozen
            plasma, and seven erythrocyte concentrates. He developed acute postoperative renal
            failure requiring hemodialysis, which delayed the start of CMV prophylaxis. On 6 June
            (postoperative day 6), CMV-DNA and pp65 were negative (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Two days later, hemodialysis could be stopped. Intravenous ganciclovir prophylaxis
            was started on 12 June (12 days after transplant). The dose of i.v. ganciclovir was
            adapted to renal function, at 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. Five doses of CMVIG (10 g; Cytotect,
            Biotest AG, Dreieich, Germany) were also administered, on 1 June, 10 June, 18 June,
            16 July, and 3 August. On 10 June, the patient was still negative for CMV-DNA and
            pp65, and he had no CMV-specific T-cells, which were assessed directly from whole
            blood after a 6-hour stimulation with a CMV lysate along with negative and positive
            control stimulations. Detection was based on intracellular IFN-
            <i>γ</i> staining in CD69
            <sup>+</sup>-positive activated CD4
            <sup>+</sup> T-cells using flow cytometry, as described previously [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B16">16</a>

            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B17">17</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. By 16 June, however, CMV-DNA had become detectable (450 copies/mL), rising to 530
            copies/mL two days later and to 1200 copies/mL by 23 June despite interruption of
            azathioprine therapy on 17 June to decrease the intensity of immunosuppression. At
            this point, he had not developed any CMV-specific T-cells, and there was concern that
            ganciclovir-related bone marrow toxicity may have suppressed their emergence. The
            decision was made to switch from ganciclovir to foscarnet (Foscavir, Clinigen, Burton-on-Trent,
            UK) on 23 June. There was a transient decrease in the CMV viral load after the start
            of foscarnet therapy, but by 23 July it had increased again to 3600 copies/mL (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). In response to this increase, on 21 August, foscarnet was discontinued and i.v.
            cidofovir (Vistide, Gilead Sciences Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) was started empirically
            at a dose of 5 mg/kg (294 mg), repeated on 28 August. Cidofovir administration was
            repeated at a dose of 5 mg/kg every two weeks from 11 September 2009 to 28 January
            2010. In addition, CMVIG at a dose of 10 g was started on 24 August 2009 in response
            to the increasing CMV load, initially given every two weeks and then every four weeks
            until 1 March 2010. At that point, low levels of CMV-specific T-cells had been detected
            for the first time and increased thereafter. Triple immunosuppressive therapy was
            restarted. At last follow-up, in June 2015, the patient was in very good clinical
            condition with no evidence of bronchiolitis obliterans. Renal function was moderately
            impaired, with serum creatinine of 1.42 mg/dL and estimated GFR of 56 mL/min. The
            patient has remained negative for CMV-DNA and pp65 and highly positive for CMV-specific
            T-cells.

      <div tagxxx="sec">
         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>The literature contains only a few case reports and no randomized trials regarding
            use of CMVIG to treat CMV infection after lung transplantation. In this patient who
            developed CMV infection approximately two weeks after lung transplantation, introduction
            of foscarnet, followed by switch to cidofovir combined with CMVIG, ultimately achieved
            viral clearance and a satisfactory clinical outcome. In this hard-to-treat case, CMVIG
            has off-label use as adjunctive therapy to antiviral drugs, being licensed only for
            the prophylaxis of CMV infection. The infection did not respond to ganciclovir or
            foscarnet, and CMV viral load was rising. Although ganciclovir resistance testing
            was not performed, the presence of resistance cannot be ruled out. A switch to cidofovir
            and continuing treatment with repeated doses of CMVIG at a relatively high dose led
            to the point where anti-CMV therapy could be withdrawn. No side effects of this treatment
            were observed.
         </p>
         <p>The patient did not develop any CMV-specific T-cells during several months of CMV
            infection, although general T-cell function determined after polyclonal stimulation
            was readily detectable (data not shown). In this situation, the combined action of
            cidofovir and CMVIG was associated with a slow decrease in viral replication which
            may have eventually allowed induction of CMV-specific cellular immunity, which in
            turn may have contributed to control of viremia after stopping therapy. One may speculate
            that the combined treatment was effective, as CMVIG alone administered prophylactically
            did not prevent CMV primary infection in the first days after transplantation. The
            decision to stop treatment was guided by CMV-specific T-cell immunity as well as levels
            of CMV-DNA and pp65.
         </p>
         <p>As demonstrated in this case, the induction of CMV-specific T-cell responses after
            primary infection can be used as a tool to assess the individual's ability to control
            virus replication in the absence of further therapy [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B16">16</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In CMV-seropositive transplant recipients, a decrease in the frequency of CMV-specific
            CD4
            <sup>+</sup> T-cells may be predictive for CMV-associated disease [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B17">17</a>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Individual levels of CMV-specific T-cells may decline due to increased viral replication
            and consumption of specific T-cells. Since an impaired CMV-specific T-cell response
            may help to identify patients at risk for uncontrolled viral replication, monitoring
            of CMV-specific CD4
            <sup>+</sup> T-cells and viral load could support targeting of antiviral therapy and determination
            of the optimal duration [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B16">16</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B17">17</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>The case has several limitations. It could be speculated that starting CMV prophylaxis
            earlier in this high-risk patient with CMV serology mismatch might have avoided CMV
            primary infection and the need for extended treatment. The prolonged failure to mount
            an adequate CMV-specific T-cell response despite detectable CMV viremia, however,
            is associated with a poor prognosis and lack of response to CMV treatment. In addition,
            since cidofovir and CMVIG were coadministered, the individual contribution to control
            of viremia cannot be determined. In addition to the neutralizing effect of CMV-specific
            humoral immunity, the immunomodulatory effect of CMVIG treatment may have contributed
            to preservation of good lung function despite reduced immunosuppression, with the
            patient showing supranormal expiratory flow-volume curves. This type of treatment
            may therefore be considered as adjunct therapy in patients with a poor response to
            direct antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir or foscarnet. Management of CMV complications
            after lung transplantation may be further improved by monitoring of both CMV-specific
            CD4
            <sup>+</sup> T-cells and viral load to guide the intensity and duration of CMV treatment, with
            combined administration of CMVIG and antiviral drugs during phases of viral replication.
