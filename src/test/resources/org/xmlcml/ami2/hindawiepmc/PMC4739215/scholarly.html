         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) commonly results in extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH)
            in the spleen and liver as well as a variety of other organs. We present a first report
            of a unique presentation of PMF in a liver transplant recipient patient as EMH in
            the transplanted liver graft. A 76-year-old man with history of cryptogenic cirrhosis
            received cadaveric liver transplantation in 1996. He maintained a normal graft function
            and stable hematologic parameters until 2013 when he presented with anemia and progressive
            fatigue. Extensive work-up did not identify the etiology of the recent decline in
            his hemoglobin; thus a liver biopsy was done which showed findings of EMH within the
            sinusoids with increased megakaryocytes, some with atypical morphology. A BM biopsy
            revealed a hypercellular marrow, moderately increased reticulin fibrosis, and features
            consistent with primary myelofibrosis. Abdominal imaging showed a normal-size spleen
            and did not identify any sites of EMH outside of the liver. The diagnosis of myelofibrosis
            was thus made, and this case demonstrated predominant tropism to a transplanted liver
            graft with absence of EMH elsewhere. We would thus like to emphasize that findings
            of EMH in subjects with no preexisting hematologic neoplasm should warrant close follow-up
            and assessment.

         <p>Extramedullary hematopoiesis is a well-recognized phenomenon of this disease process.
            Although typically seen in sites of fetal hematopoiesis, it can be found in any organ

         </p>
         <p>The pathophysiology of extramedullary hematopoiesis is thought to be associated with
            the constitutive mobilization of CD34+ cells into the peripheral blood. This dysregulation
            of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) trafficking likely ultimately leads to the seeding
            of extramedullary sites [

         <title>2. Case Description</title>
         <p>A 76-year-old gentleman presented to our clinic, with complaints of fatigue and shortness
            of breath on exertion. He had a history of cryptogenic cirrhosis for which he had
            underwent cadaveric liver transplantation seventeen years ago. Other comorbidities
            included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney
            disease, which was thought to be due to chronic use of calcineuric inhibitors.
         </p>
         <p>Other pertinent symptoms included easy bruising. Patient denied chest pain, leg swelling,
            frequent infections, fever, chills, appetite change, or unexpected weight change.
         </p>
         <p>Physical examination was pertinent for tachycardia. No hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy
            was appreciated. Cardiovascular and respiratory examination were unremarkable.
         </p>
         <p>Since 2009, the patient was displaying macrocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. This
            had been worsening progressively from a baseline hemoglobin of 12 g/dL in 2009 to
            8-9 g/dL in 2013. Since 2010, a thrombocytopenia of 100–150 K/UL had also been observed.
            The white blood cell count was within normal limits initially and then increased progressively
            to 59.5 K/UL with left shifted granulopoieses. Rare nucleated red blood cells were
            observed on the peripheral smear. Folate and Vitamin B-12 laboratory results were
            normal. There was mild thrombocytopenia with normal morphology. Serum LDH was increased.
            Iron studies were not suggestive of iron deficiency. An endoscopy and colonoscopy
            had failed to reveal an active source of bleeding. The patient had received Vitamin
            B-12, Folate supplementation, and Epoetin-Alfa injections for his anemia.
         </p>
         <p>As a definitive etiology had not been established, graft dysfunction and antirejection
            therapy were implicated as potential causes of this hematological process. Although
            liver function tests remained within normal limits, a liver biopsy was performed to
            determine the status of the liver and to further guide antirejection therapy.
         </p>
         <p>The liver biopsy showed findings of extramedullary hematopoiesis within the sinusoids
            with increased atypical megakaryocytes. The liver parenchyma was unremarkable with
            no evidence of rejection or increased fibrosis (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Additional work-up included a bone marrow biopsy that revealed a hypercellular
            marrow (60 percent), polymorphous trilineage hematopoiesis, moderate to severe reticulin
            fibrosis (grade 2/3), and 1% blasts (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). The number of megakaryocytes was not markedly abnormal but showed clustering on
            a subsequent bone marrow biopsy (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). Cytogenetic studies on the marrow aspirate showed abnormal karyotype: 47, XY, trisomy
            8, and add (9) (q34). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis on the blood for JAK2
            mutation was positive for V617F. Abdominal imaging showed a normal-size spleen and
            did not identify any sites of EMH outside of the liver. The diagnosis of intermediate-2
            risk PMF was made by meeting all major criteria and 3 minor criteria.
         </p>
         <p>The patient was classified as intermediate-2 risk based on the Dynamic International
            Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) given his age, anemia, and the presence of constitutional
            symptoms. He started therapy with Ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor, achieving clinical
            benefit and improvement in symptoms and appetite, and was able to tolerate therapy
            for 14 months when he progressed. He passed away 25 months after the diagnosis with
            progressive bone marrow failure.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Our patient is the first presentation of myelofibrosis in a liver transplant recipient
            patient as extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) in a transplanted liver graft, even
            prior to systemic manifestations of a myeloproliferative neoplasm. In addition, this
            case demonstrated predominant tropism to a transplanted liver graft. The megakaryocytic
            atypia and clustering were even more pronounced in the liver compared to bone marrow
            in our patient, which indicates that the unique microenvironment and immune dysregulation
            may have facilitated the expansion of this malignant clone. The next question thus
            follows: is there a unique microenvironment within the transplanted organ that facilitates
            expansion of malignant clones, as seen in our patient? This definitely merits further
            exploration.
         </p>
         <p>Interestingly, EMH has been reported in patients who have had liver grafts despite
            having no bone marrow pathology. The authors postulated various theories to explain
            this, including local factors within the graft. This was usually seen shortly after
            transplantation, and the stress of the operative procedure and the ensuing blood loss
            was seen as a strong contributing factor. However, the authors observed no corelation
            of preoperative or postoperative hemoglobin levels, graft function, kidney function,
            and immunosuppressive medication with the presence or absence of erythropoiesis in
            the grafts. This led them to conclude that intrahepatic erythropoiesis could occur
            transiently in human liver allografts [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>The only other report of myelofibrosis presenting as extramedullary hematopoiesis
            in a transplanted organ that we found in the English literature was that of a patient
            who was doing well after renal transplant until he presented with new onset proteinuria
            and rising creatinine. He was ultimately found to have myelofibrosis. On pathology,
            the appearance was similar to that of acute rejection, with the immature myeloid cells,
            megakaryocytes, and nucleated red blood cells, easily mistakable as lymphocytes [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Given that the management for a transplant rejection would be very different, it
            is important to entertain the possibility of extramedullary hematopoiesis in such
            patients, especially when confronted with other signs of bone marrow failure.

         <title>4. Conclusion</title>
         <p>We conclude by emphasizing that findings of extramedullary hematopoiesis in EMH in
            subjects with no preexisting hematological neoplasms warrant close follow-up and assessment.
