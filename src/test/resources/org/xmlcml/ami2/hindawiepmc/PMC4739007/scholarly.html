         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>A 45-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a small bowel obstruction due
            to torsion and was immediately scheduled for surgical intervention. At anesthesia
            induction, the patient aspirated and subsequently developed a severe SIRS with ARDS
            and multiple organ failure requiring the use of ECMO, CRRT, antibiotics, and low dose
            steroids. Due to a rapid deterioration in clinical status and a concurrent surge in
            inflammatory biomarkers, an extracorporeal cytokine adsorber (CytoSorb) was added
            to the CRRT blood circuit. The combined treatment resulted in a rapid and significant
            reduction in the levels of circulating inflammatory mediators. This decrease was paralleled
            by marked clinical stabilization of the patient including a significant improvement
            in hemodynamic stability and a reduced need for norepinephrine and improved respiratory
            function as measured by PaO
            <sub>2</sub>/FIO
            <sub>2</sub>, ventilator parameters, lung mechanics, and indirect measures of capillary leak syndrome.
            The patient could be discharged to a respiratory weaning unit where successful respiratory
            weaning could be achieved later on. We attribute the clinical improvement to the rapid
            control of the hyperinflammatory response and the reduction of inflammatory mediators
            using a combination of CytoSorb and these other therapies. CytoSorb treatment was
            safe and well tolerated, with no device-related adverse effects observed.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Pulmonary aspiration of gastric or oropharyngeal fluid is a serious complication of
            general anesthesia that can lead to the development of acute respiratory distress
            syndrome (ARDS) in up to 30% of patients, the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
            (ECMO), and the high risk of mortality [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Patients often develop a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
            that can lead to hemodynamic instability and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS),
            further complicating treatment [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. A recently introduced extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption device called CytoSorb
            (CytoSorbents Corporation, USA) has gained interest in the field of critical care
            and cardiac surgery as a strategy to help control severe SIRS. Unlike metabolic approaches
            to anti-inflammation, CytoSorb is designed to directly capture and reduce mid-molecular
            weight inflammatory mediators (~10–60 kDa) in blood including both pro- and anti-inflammatory
            cytokines, chemokines, and bacterial exotoxins [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>

               </sup>
            </span>]. It works with standard hemodialysis or CRRT machines to purify blood extracorporeally.
            The technology is based on highly porous, biocompatible nonpolar polymer beads that
            are capable of capturing these inflammatory mediators from whole blood through size
            exclusion and nonspecific surface adsorption throughout the entire bead. The device
            is concentration dependent, reducing substances at high concentration efficiently,
            while having significantly less activity on substances at low concentration. This
            presumably is partially responsible for the observed reduction, but not complete elimination
            (which would be undesirable), of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators in patients
            treated with CytoSorb.

         <p>We herein report on a patient with an extreme SIRS response, cytokine storm, ARDS,
            and severe hemodynamic impairment following pulmonary aspiration during anesthesia
            induction, who was successfully treated with a combination of hemoadsorption with
            CytoSorb, ECMO, CRRT, antibiotics, and low dose steroids.

         <title>2. Case Presentation</title>
         <p>A 45-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with a small bowel obstruction
            due to torsion and was immediately scheduled for surgical intervention. Prior medical
            history included an anterior rectal resection requiring an enterostomy due to anastomotic
            insufficiency. At anesthesia induction, the patient aspirated and immediately underwent
            bronchoscopy which confirmed pulmonary aspiration. Laparotomy was performed and decompression
            of the small bowel was achieved. However, during the ongoing operation (4 hours in
            total), the patient developed progressive and severe respiratory failure (paO
            <sub>2</sub> 48 mmHg, FIO
            <sub>2</sub> 1,0, paO
            <sub>2</sub>/FIO
            <sub>2</sub> ratio 48, and paCO
            <sub>2</sub> 75 mmHg, pH 7.09) despite mechanical ventilatory support. Therefore, the patient
            was switched to venovenous ECMO (VV-ECMO). However, four hours later, insufficient
            VV-ECMO flow and the rapid development of right ventricular failure necessitated a
            switch to central venoarterial ECMO (VA-ECMO). Sufficient ECMO flow was restored with
            an improvement in gas exchange (paO
            <sub>2</sub> 83 mmHg, paCO
            <sub>2</sub> 38 mmHg, pH 7.39). Twelve hours after the start of VA-ECMO, lung computer tomography
            confirmed severe bilateral pulmonary consolidation (see 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>).
         </p>
         <p>However, the patient's condition continued to worsen with clinical and functional
            signs of severe exudative ARDS with alveolar edema (paO
            <sub>2</sub> 49 mmHg, paCO
            <sub>2</sub> 43 mmHg, and lung compliance &lt;15 mL/cm H
            <sub>2</sub>O), systemic vasoplegia (norepinephrine dose 0.31 
            <i>µ</i>g/kg/min), and marked capillary leak syndrome (fluid balance + 4,080 mL after 12 hours
            in the ICU). In addition, the patient exhibited leukocytopenia (0.2 Giga/L), requiring
            the application of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analog filgrastim (Neupogen,
            Amgen) and acute kidney injury (AKIN Stage 3) necessitating continuous renal replacement
            therapy (CRRT-CVVHD, multiFiltrate, Fresenius Medical Care) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. At this time, the patient exhibited a massive increase in inflammatory biomarkers
            (IL-6 20,000 pg/mL, IL-8 24,656 pg/mL, and PCT &gt; 100 
            <i>µ</i>g/L). Microbiological findings of intraoperative abdominal swabs revealed
            <i> Klebsiella</i>,
            <i> E. coli</i>, and Enterococci, while material from the respiratory tract indicated growth of
            <i> E. coli</i> and
            <i> Candida</i>. Combined treatment with meropenem (primed continuous infusion), linezolid, and anidulafungin
            was initiated. Further treatment included bronchoscopy, continued VA-ECMO combined
            with protective ventilation, kinetic positioning using a Rotorest (KCI) bed, and application
            of the sepsis bundle including administration of low dose hydrocortisone.
         </p>
         <p>Despite these interventions, the patient remained in septic shock and was in critical
            status with regard to vasoplegia, hemodynamics, and capillary leakage. On post-op
            Day 1, an extracorporeal cytokine hemoadsorption cartridge (CytoSorb, CytoSorbents
            Corp., USA) was added in series to the CRRT system (Fresenius multiFiltrate) in a
            predialyzer position. During CytoSorb treatment, antibiotics were administered routinely
            as follows: meropenem 500 mg bolus followed by infusion of 1.45 mg/kg/h, anidulafungin
            prolonged infusion at 200 mg per day, and linezolid prolonged infusion 600 mg twice
            a day. A total of three treatments with a combination of CytoSorb and CRRT were consecutively
            performed for a total of 85 hours (20 hours + 35 hours + 29 hours) at a blood flow
            rate of 100–140 mL/min. Regional anticoagulation was achieved using a citrate-based
            protocol. Of note, the first treatment was interrupted for 4.5 hours due to a thoracic
            CT scan and surgical revision in order to reposition the arterial ECMO cannula to
            improve blood flow. When treatment was paused, the blood circuit was flushed with
            saline and was then later safely restarted. Following the addition of CytoSorb, a
            pronounced decrease in the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 was observed which continued
            to decrease further in the following days (see 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). As shown in 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>, when the patient was on CRRT and VA-ECMO alone on Day 0, prior to CytoSorb usage,
            there was no change in the plasma levels of either IL-6 and IL-8. This cytokine reduction
            was associated temporally with a stabilization of clinical parameters. The patient
            stabilized hemodynamically under continued CytoSorb, VA-ECMO, and CRRT treatment,
            and the need for norepinephrine was significantly reduced (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). In addition, respiratory function improved during the treatment course, with a
            disappearance of any signs of alveolar exudation as confirmed by daily bronchoscopy.
            In parallel, the severity of capillary leakage as demonstrated by daily fluid needs
            and daily fluid balance became less apparent (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>).
         </p>
         <p>At postoperative Day 12, therapy was started with methylprednisolone following the
            Meduri protocol, in order to inhibit fibroproliferation in the lung and risk of fibrosis
            during ARDS [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Gradual additional improvements in lung recruitment and alveolar ventilation were
            observed. A percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on Day 13. By postoperative Day
            18, the patient's respiratory function, along with gas exchange and lung mechanics,
            on mechanical ventilation had sufficiently improved such that VA-ECMO was discontinued.
            CRRT had to be continued for a period of 20 days and could then be stopped after sufficient
            recovery of renal function.
         </p>
         <p>On Day 27, the patient was transferred to a respiratory weaning unit where the patient
            was subsequently successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation, with a discontinuation
            of CRRT and the recovery of renal function.
         </p>
         <p>Informed consent to use clinical data for scientific purposes was obtained from the
            patient's legal caregiver.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>This case report highlights the stabilization and successful treatment of a complicated
            pulmonary aspiration postsurgical patient with septic shock and polymicrobial infection,
            severe exudative ARDS, renal failure, and a severe SIRS response with pronounced hypercytokinemia.
            Treatment encompassed a combination of cytokine reduction and inflammation reduction
            with CytoSorb, extracorporeal oxygenation and support with VA-ECMO, renal support
            with CRRT, low dose hydrocortisone treatment per sepsis bundle guidelines, and infection
            source control with broad spectrum antibiotics. Underlying the multiple organ failure
            was a severe SIRS/sepsis response, despite initial leukopenia, with extremely high
            levels of IL-6 (20,000 pg/mL) and IL-8 (24,656 pg/mL), exudative alveolar edema, systemic
            vasoplegia, and marked capillary leak syndrome. The use of a CytoSorb cytokine adsorber
            with this multipronged therapeutic approach resulted in a profound decrease in plasma
            concentrations of both IL-6 and IL-8, both classic inflammatory mediators. This reduction
            was paralleled by a significant clinical stabilization of the patient during the course
            of the combined treatment. Importantly, the treatment bundle was able to reverse the
            systemic vasoplegia and hemodynamic collapse, which is unlikely to be fully explained
            by the limited circulatory support of central VA-ECMO. In addition, the combined treatment
            reversed the highly exudative phase of ARDS, as demonstrated by bronchoscopy, and
            appeared to decrease capillary leak syndrome and alveolar fluid accumulation, as evidenced
            by improved respiratory function, a significantly reduced need for fluid resuscitation,
            and achievement of a negative fluid balance shortly after therapy initiation. Although
            a causal relationship cannot be proven, we presume that controlling the excessive
            inflammatory response helped to stabilize the patient. These observations are in line
            with a number of recently published case reports using CytoSorb in septic patients,
            correlating the positive effects of cytokine adsorption on inflammation, hemodynamics,
            and organ recovery [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>More randomized controlled studies using CytoSorb in critically ill patients will
            help to establish the true benefit of the therapy. Certainly, this case report that
            uses multiple interventions to treat this complex patient prevents us from ascribing
            the patient's positive outcome to any one treatment modality. In addition, cytokine
            levels could have gradually decreased on their own due to the use of antibiotics (e.g.,
            improved source control reduces stimulation of the immune response), as was observed
            in the largest community acquired pneumonia and sepsis study (GenIMS) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>], or low dose hydrocortisone (administered here according to sepsis bundle guidelines)
            which has been previously associated with reduced concentrations of IL-6 and diminished
            <i> de novo</i> production of several interleukins [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. We would note, however, that none of these approaches are mutually exclusive. In
            fact, they may all be synergistic with each other and may be needed to achieve the
            elusive improvements in mortality that no single sepsis treatment has yet been able
            to demonstrate or maintain.
         </p>
         <p>In conclusion, we believe that control over the patient's initial hyperinflammatory
            response was a key element in helping clinically stabilize the patient, allowing for
            organ recovery and ultimately survival. In this very challenging clinical case, we
            used all of the tools available to us to do so, including CytoSorb cytokine adsorption,
            CVVH, VA-ECMO, antibiotics, and steroids. CytoSorb is the newest therapy in our toolkit
            and was safe and well tolerated with no device-related adverse events and easy to
            implement as part of the CVVH circuit. Based upon our positive clinical experience
            with CytoSorb as an adjunctive therapy to standard of care therapy for critical illnesses
            to date, we look forward to future systematic clinical trials that will clarify its
            contribution and potential in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock.
