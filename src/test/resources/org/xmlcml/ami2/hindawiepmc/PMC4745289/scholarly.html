         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Bladder duplication is a rare entity in children. The term encompasses a wide spectrum
            of anomalies from isolated bladder duplication in coronal or sagittal planes to duplicated
            bladder exstrophy and associated musculoskeletal and visceral anomalies. Given this
            wide variability, the treatment of these patients is not standardized. We hereby present
            a female patient with chief complaint of long-standing urinary incontinence who had
            complete bladder and urethral duplication and pubic diastasis. The patient was treated
            with bulking agent injection at the incompetent bladder neck and proximal urethra
            with resolution of incontinence, obviating the need for extensive surgeries.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Bladder duplication is a rare congenital anomaly traditionally classified as complete
            or incomplete. In complete forms, two bladders are fully apart in the sagittal or
            coronal plane and have distinct mucosal lining and muscular walls. Usually each bladder
            receives the ipsilateral ureter and drains into a distinct urethra [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This condition may be associated with multiple congenital anomalies mostly in the
            urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts and also skeletal system [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Since a small number of cases are reported in the literature and also given the wide
            spectrum of anomalies in these patients, the simple classification of bladder duplication
            may not be able to explain all the observed variations. Additionally, management of
            bladder duplication is not standardized and should be individualized according to
            each patient's condition in order to improve the final outcome. We hereby report a
            patient with complete bladder and urethral duplication and the management of incontinence
            in this case using a minimally invasive approach.

         <title>2. Case Presentation</title>
         <p>A 14-year-old girl was referred to our tertiary urology clinic for evaluation of long-standing
            urinary incontinence and complex genitourinary malformations. She had a history of
            incontinence noted soon after birth and past surgical history was positive for removal
            of a red mucosal protrusion from her vaginal introitus after birth but no pathologic
            report was available. She had experienced multiple relapses and also had undergone
            surgery for approximation of pubic symphysis at the age of five but urinary incontinence
            persisted. At presentation she was afebrile with no evidence of urinary tract infection.
            In physical examination she had two distinct urethras and a vulva with two vaginal
            openings. The patient was able to void from both urethras but reported incontinency
            from the right urethra. A thorough neurological examination was unremarkable.
         </p>
         <p>Routine laboratory evaluations including blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine
            levels were within normal limits. Plain abdominal radiography showed sacral hypoplasia
            and pubic symphysis diastasis that was previously operated as indicated by metal sutures
            in place. Ultrasound study reported normal uterus and kidneys but revealed two adjacent
            cystic masses in pelvis suggestive of duplicated bladder and also showed two distinct
            vaginal canals separated by a septum and a single normal uterus.
         </p>
         <p>Both urethras were catheterized using 10-Fr. catheters and voiding cystourethrography
            (VCUG) was performed. VCUG confirmed complete bladder duplication in the sagittal
            plane with each urethra draining the ipsilateral bladder; no vesicoureteral reflux
            was noted (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Cystoscopy through the right urethra showed the right bladder (volume: 150 cc)
            with a single horseshoe ureteral orifice and an incompletely developed bladder neck
            in the distal part. Cystoscopy through the left urethra showed the left bladder (volume:
            300 cc) with a normal ureteral orifice and no communication with the right bladder.
            Vaginoscopy showed two vaginal canals that were distally separated by a septum with
            confluence near the cervix. Further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging
            (MRI) and urography (MRU) confirmed presence of a single unicornuate uterus, two separate
            bladders, and normal kidneys and ureters (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). Ureters on each side drained into the ipsilateral bladder.
         </p>
         <p>The patient underwent vaginal septum resection. Since the main and only complaint
            was urinary incontinence, the decision was made to endoscopically correct it without
            performing an extensive open surgery. Cystoscopy was performed and calcium hydroxyapatite
            was endoscopically injected into the right bladder neck and proximal urethra as a
            bulking agent. Urodynamic studies of the bladders after intervention revealed normal
            patterns in filling and voiding phases (right maximum detrusor pressure: 24 cm H
            <sub>2</sub>O, end-filling pressure: 6 cm H
            <sub>2</sub>O; left maximum detrusor pressure: 11 cm H
            <sub>2</sub>O, end-filling pressure: 2 cm H
            <sub>2</sub>O). The patient was discharged in good general condition and complete continence without
            any symptoms. She was dry and satisfied with her condition at 3.5-year follow-up with
            no urinary tract infection or incontinence. The patient was lost to follow-up afterwards.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>In 1961, Abrahamson proposed classifying bladder duplication as either incomplete
            or complete that occurs in sagittal or coronal planes [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Although most duplicated bladders are located side by side in the sagittal plane,
            fewer are reported in the anteroposterior position (coronal plane) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Interestingly, the latter condition sometimes occurs in association with epispadias
            or more extensively bladder exstrophy. These findings raise the question whether bladder
            duplication shares some of the embryologic defects seen in epispadias exstrophy complex
            (EEC). Lowentritt et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] reviewed more than 815 EEC patients and defined a subgroup of complex EEC variants
            as “bladder exstrophy with duplication.” This category mostly included anteroposterior
            bladder duplications in a way that a patch of everted bladder mucosa rests on anterior
            abdominal wall and the posterior intact bladder lies in pelvis receiving both ureters.
            In fact, this variant is a shared point in the definitions of bladder exstrophy variants
            and bladder duplication. Although this definition offers some insight into the common
            origin of EEC variants and bladder duplication, some patients with duplicated bladders
            do not have classic findings of exstrophy but have epispadias and also pubic diastasis.
            For example, our patient had a wide pubic diastasis but both bladders were located
            in the pelvis without any other sign of bladder exstrophy. Also covered exstrophy
            with duplicated bladder and visceral sequestration has been previously reported that
            differs with the classic definition of duplicated exstrophy [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Karpathakis et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] also reported an adult male with duplicated bladder in coronal plate and epispadiac
            duplicated urethra. These findings propose that “Exstrophy-Epispadias Complex with
            Duplication” encompasses a spectrum of anomalies including conditions like epispadias
            with bladder duplication, covered bladder exstrophy with duplication, and classic
            bladder exstrophy with duplication. A duplicated urethra and pubic diastasis may provide
            invaluable diagnostic clues to this condition.
         </p>
         <p>Regardless of the terminology and the classification used, prompt management of clinical
            symptoms is the main goal in these patients. Since bladder duplication encompasses
            a wide range of anomalies (from incomplete to complete bladder duplication and from
            isolated urinary system anomaly to multiple concomitant anomalies), the clinical significance
            of this condition largely depends on the associated complaints like incontinence,
            recurrent infections, and bladder outlet obstruction. However, many patients may be
            asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally so treatment is guided by the clinical presentations
            and should be individualized and targeted to alleviate the symptoms [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This may vary from no intervention in asymptomatic cases to intensive surgeries
            to correct multiple anomalies. In our patient, long-standing urinary incontinence
            from the right anterior bladder was the sole complaint and continence was achieved
            with endoscopic injection of bulking agent into the bladder neck sphincter. This approach
            obviated the need for extensive pelvic surgery to unite the bladders and provided
            acceptable postsurgical results with full continence. Similarly, Quiroz-Guerrero et
            al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] reported a case of complete duplication of bladder and urethra in the sagittal plane
            with presence of a vaginal septum and visceral sequestration. Given that both urinary
            systems had acceptable urodynamic functions with no incontinence, they did not perform
            surgical intervention and the patient had excellent functional outcome in a 5-year
            follow-up [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Another similarity of the aforementioned patient to ours is the presence of the
            mucosal protrusion that was surgically removed at an early stage. Although we did
            not have access to the pathology report of the excised tissue, in two similar cases
            the histologic evaluation of tissues showed bowel sequestration with intestinal epithelium
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In patients with recurrent urinary infection, persistent incontinence, and in those
            with abnormal function in one or both of the bladders, more invasive surgical approaches
            like unilateral cystectomy or augmentation cysto-cystoplasty may be preferred [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Taken together, the current classification of bladder duplication by Abrahamson [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] does not fully explain the wide variations encountered in reality and a more comprehensive
            and detailed classification may shed some light on the embryological origins of this
            anomaly. This is particularly true for patients with lower urinary tract duplication
            and concomitant signs of bladder exstrophy [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. The surgical approach in bladder duplication may be individualized and injection
            of bulking agent into the bladder neck may provide an alternative noninvasive approach.
