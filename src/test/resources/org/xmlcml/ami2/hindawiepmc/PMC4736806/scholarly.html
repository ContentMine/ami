         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Objective</i>. Maxillary anterior spacing is a common aesthetic complaint of patients. Midline
            diastema has a multifactorial etiology such as labial frenulum, microdontia, mesiodens,
            peg-shaped lateral incisors, agenesis, cysts, habits such as finger sucking, tongue
            thrusting, or lip sucking, dental malformations, genetics, proclinations, dental-skeletal
            discrepancies, and imperfect coalescence of interdental septum. Appropriate technique
            and material for effective treatment are based on time, physical, psychological, and
            economical limitations. Direct composite resins in diastema cases allow dentist and
            patient complete control of these limitations and formation of natural smile.
            <i> Clinical Considerations</i>. In this case report a maxillary midline diastema was closed with direct composite
            resin restorations in one appointment without any preparation. One bottle total etch
            adhesive was used and translucent/opaque composite resin shades were layered on mesial
            surfaces of the teeth that were isolated with rubber dam and Teflon bands. Finishing
            and polishing procedures were achieved by using polishing discs. Patient was informed
            for recalls for every 6 months.
            <i> Conclusions</i>. At one-year recall no sensitivities, discolorations, or fractures were detected
            on teeth and restorations. Direct composite resins seemed to be highly aesthetic and
            durable restorations that can satisfy patients as under the conditions of case presented.

         <p>Maxillary anterior spacing or diastema is a common aesthetic complaint of patients

            </span>]. The midline diastema has a multifactorial etiology. In addition to the labial frenulum,
            microdontia, mesiodens, peg-shaped lateral incisors, lateral incisor agenesis, cysts
            in the midline region, habits such as finger sucking, tongue thrusting, and/or lip
            sucking, dental malformations, genetics, maxillary incisor proclination, dental-skeletal
            discrepancies, and imperfect coalescence of the interdental septum should be considered
            factors that can cause diastema [

            </span>]. The width to length ratio of the central incisors for aesthetic rehabilitation
            in complex midline diastema closure cases determines the treatment plan. Decisions
            such as the amount of distal proximal reduction, the number of teeth to be treated,
            the placement and location of prominences and concavities to create the illusion,
            and the decision for full-veneers or just adding to the interproximal are decided
            according to that ratio [

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 32-year-old male patient reported to the Department of Restorative Dentistry, Faculty
            of Dentistry, Marmara University, with the chief complaint of spacing in the upper
            front tooth region. Patient's medical history did not reveal any systemic diseases
            and intraoral examination revealed presence of midline spacing between maxillary central
            incisors (~4 mm) due to tongue thrust parafunction (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). No dental caries were observed in both clinical and radiographical examinations.
            As a more conservative, economical, aesthetic, and quicker option, direct aesthetic
            partial composite laminate veneers as build-ups for both maxillary central incisors
            were considered.
         </p>
         <p>Firstly, shade selection was considered A1 shade of Vita guide for the teeth to be
            restored. In order to simulate a natural A1 shade outlook, the shades BW, A1, and
            JE (Gaenial, GC, Japan) were decided to be used together as layers. No preparations
            were performed before the restoration procedure (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). All maxillary incisors were isolated with rubber dam (Kerr, USA) and the central
            incisors were retracted by using retraction cord (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). The adjacent central incisor was covered with Teflon band while the other was restored.
            37% phosphoric acid (Etching Gel, Kerr, USA) was applied on the mesial surface to
            be restored for 15 seconds, rinsed for 20 seconds, and dried with air slightly. Then
            a single bottle bonding agent (Adper Single Bond, 3M ESPE, USA) was applied and polymerized
            for 20 seconds with a LED light generator (Demi Led Light Curing System, Kerr, USA).
            A thin layer of JE shade transparent composite resin was used palatinally as enamel
            (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>). A thin layer of BW shade opaque composite resin was placed roughly as second layer
            (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</span>). A1 shade composite resin was used as dentin layer and a thin layer JE shade was
            used as the top enamel layer. Labial surfaces of the restorations were flattened by
            using a red banded knife-edge tip diamond bur (Acurata, Germany) (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</span>). Polishing discs (Ultra Gloss Composite Polishing System, Axis, USA) were used for
            detailed polishing from rough to fine grains by using a low speed handpiece (DURAtec
            2068D, Germany) (Figures 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</span> and 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</span>).
         </p>
         <p>The patient was motivated for oral hygiene and informed for recalls. At the 6-month
            recall the restorations were just polished with polishing discs. At one-year recall
            no sensitivities, discolorations, or fractures were detected on the teeth and the
            restorations (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</span>).

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>The direct composite resin restorations can be placed in a single visit, often do
            not require preliminary models or wax-ups, and do not involve laboratory fees that
            escalate costs. In terms of aesthetic dentistry, these restorations offer numerous
            advantages that other possible treatment options such as ceramic veneers and orthodontic
            treatment do not have. They are kinder to the opposing dentition compared to ceramic
            materials [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">14</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] and, in the event of an unforeseen fracture, they can be repaired easily compared
            to costly and time-consuming repairs or remakes for porcelain alternatives [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B15">15</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. There are also some disadvantages of direct composite resin restorations compared
            to some indirect porcelain alternatives. Most composite materials possess less fractural
            toughness, shear, and compressive strength and are not ideally suited for ultra-high-stress
            areas found in certain clinical situations [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B16">16</a>

                  <a href="#B17">17</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Presence of unmanaged parafunctional forces such as bruxism, Class III end-to-end
            occlusal schemes, or noxious oral habits such as nail biting can potentially jeopardize
            the longevity of direct composite resin restorations [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Moreover, the color stability of direct composite resin restorations is not as
            inert as glazed ceramics; however, this depends on the quality of finishing and polishing
            procedures and can be prevented with recalls [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Regardless of the fact that direct composite resin restorations have these disadvantages,
            the developing adhesive techniques and better quality resin materials give dentists
            the chance to create more conservative, functional, aesthetic, economic, and long
            lasting restorations also in a very short chair time [

         </p>
         <p>In this case report, one-year recall of a midline diastema closure treatment by using
            direct composite resins was assessed. Creating a wax-up restoration previously to
            simulate the diastema closure and building a silicon matrix to guide final composite
            resin restoration are a common method for this kind of cases [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B22">22</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, in this case report, another technique was used without creating a silicon
            matrix. The midline diastema was closed by building up the mesial surfaces of central
            incisors one by one. The teeth were isolated with rubber dam, retraction cords, and
            the central incisor adjacent to the one to be restored was covered with Teflon band.
            Teflon band is a very thin band that gives the opportunity to create very close contact
            and perfect isolation where resin based restoration materials do not adhere. There
            was no need for using transparent matrix bands or wedges in this technique. This isolation
            technique allowed us to create two separate restorations having a really close natural
            alike contact without creating a dark triangle because of not using wedge which are
            important advantages compared with the silicon matrix technique [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The teeth were restored one by one by layering technique that can also be used
            in silicon matrix technique [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">13</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The treatments without creating previous wax-up restorations and a silicon matrix
            were performed in a very short period of time which is another advantage. In this
            technique the positioning of the midline and the location of the contact area were
            decided by the dentist allowing him/her to simulate a natural outlook. However, these
            decisions and restorations without a guide such as silicon matrix are not easy to
            perform. The dentist should be well experienced about this technique in order to create
            a correct midline as well as a natural smile design which can be calculated as a disadvantage
            compared with the other technique.
         </p>
         <p>Restoration using ceramic fragment is another treatment option for these cases. It
            is an indirect ceramic restoration that is prepared in a laboratory and attached to
            previously prepared area of tooth. This technique needs at least two appointments
            which can be defined as a disadvantage compared with direct techniques. According
            to the manipulation of the technician, the restorations by using ceramic fragments
            can be functional and simulate natural esthetics [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">

               </sup>
            </span>]. On the other hand recent studies also showed that direct composite resin restorations
            are considered functional, stable, aesthetical, and cheaper restorations completed
            in less chair time by using appropriate techniques for patients with appropriate occlusion

            </span>]. Capability of being repaired easily in case of fractures is another important advantage
            of direct composite resin restorations. Although direct resin restorations are considered
            to be stable, the color stability of ceramic restorations is still much better. The
            best solution for this problem is the perfection in finishing and polishing procedures
            and frequent recalls [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. In this case report direct composite resin restorations were decided as the treatment
            method due to aesthetical demands of the patient having restricted time and money.
         </p>
         <p>At six-month and one-year recalls the general outlook of the maxillary anterior teeth
            was considered natural and aesthetical. Clinically, both restorations have no fractures
            and also the restoration margins on both maxillary central incisors demonstrated no
            discolorations. Although one-year follow-up does not seem long enough and further
            long term follow-ups are required, restoration problems such as marginal leakage,
            discolorations, fractures, and debonding for composite resins generally merge within
            6 months after the treatment. By taking this into consideration and according to the
            positive results, an experienced dentist with proper case selection, using an appropriate
            technique and modern materials, can perform highly aesthetic and durable direct composite
            resin restorations that can satisfy patients as under the conditions of the case presented.
