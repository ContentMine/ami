         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Introduction</i>. Biliary atresia is a surgical cause of prolonged jaundice, which needs to be diagnosed
            with cholangiography that has traditionally been performed via laparotomy. Laparoscopic
            assistance has lately been introduced to avoid unnecessary laparotomy. We aim to evaluate
            the benefits of the laparoscopy-assisted cholangiography and compare it to the traditional
            procedure via laparotomy. 
            <i>Patients and Method</i>. The medical records of the cases who had undergone cholangiography for prolonged
            jaundice between 2007 and 2014 were analyzed. The patients were grouped according
            to cholangiography technique (laparotomy/laparoscopy). The laparoscopy and laparotomy
            groups with patent bile ducts were focused and compared in terms of operation duration,
            postoperative initiation time of enteral feeding, and full enteral feeding achievement
            time. 
            <i>Results</i>. Sixty-one infants with prolonged jaundice were evaluated between 2007 and 2014.
            Among the patients with patent bile ducts, operation duration, postoperative enteral
            feeding initiation time, and the time to achieve full enteral feeding were shorter
            in laparoscopy group. 
            <i>Conclusion</i>. Laparoscopic cholangiography is safe and less time-consuming compared to laparotomy,
            with less postoperative burden. As early age of operation is a very important prognostic
            factor, laparoscopic evaluation should be an early option in work-up of the infants
            with prolonged jaundice with direct hyperbilirubinemia, for diagnosis/exclusion of
            biliary atresia.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Prolonged jaundice is defined as jaundice longer than 14 days in term infants and
            21 days in preterm infants. Over this period, prolonged jaundice with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
            in a newborn with pale stool and dark urine alerts the pediatrician to investigate
            the cholestatic disorders such as infections due to congenital rubella, CMV, toxoplasmosis,
            and endocrine and metabolic disorders as hypothyroidism, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,
            and aminoaciduria. After all these investigations, ultrasonography, hepatic scintigraphy,
            and usually liver biopsy take place. In cases of no diagnosis despite these investigations,
            surgical exploration is usually needed to exclude biliary atresia. Cholangiography
            via laparotomy or laparoscopy has remained as the gold standard for the diagnosis
            of biliary atresia. Invasiveness and high morbidity of explorative procedure generally
            make pediatricians refer the patient to the pediatric surgeon after their investigations
            exclude all nonsurgical causes of jaundice. On the other hand, early identification
            of biliary atresia affects the success rate of the operation and improves the outcome
            [

         </p>
         <p>Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure that can exclude surgical causes of
            jaundice and may help avoid unnecessary laparotomy in neonates.
         </p>
         <p>Herein, we present our technique, laparoscopy-assisted percutaneous cholangiography
            with liver biopsy with a single umbilical trocar, and compared the results of this
            technique with traditional open surgical explorative cholangiography and liver biopsy.

         <title>2. Patients and Method</title>
         <p>We performed a retrospective chart review of all infants who were referred between
            December 2007 and December 2014, with prolonged jaundice in whom clinical, radiological,
            and laboratory tests failed to get a definitive diagnosis and surgical evaluation
            was needed to exclude biliary atresia. Infants who had undergone Kasai portoenterostomy
            were excluded from the study. The patients with patent biliary duct systems were included
            in the study and these patients were divided into two groups: Group I, patients who
            had single-port laparoscopy-assisted percutaneous cholangiography and liver biopsy,
            and Group II, patients who had cholangiography and liver biopsy via laparotomy. Those
            groups were compared in terms of operation duration, postoperative enteral feeding
            initiation time, time to achieve full enteral feeding, and postoperative complications.
            Evaluation of hospital stay length and cost effectiveness was not possible, because
            most of the patients had been hospitalized in pediatric clinics long before their
            referral to our department (Pediatric Surgery), some with additional serious anomalies,
            so that the hospital stay lengths and hospitalization costs were far away from being
            attributable to the cholangiography techniques.

            <h3>2.1. Statistical Methods</h3>
            <p>Normality was checked by Shapiro-Wilks test continuous variables. Nonparametric tests
               were chosen since the data were not distributed normally. Data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney
               
               <i>U</i> test and Chi Square test was used to evaluate the differences between groups. Data
               were expressed as 
               <i>n</i> (%), mean ± SD, and median (min-max). A 
               <i>p</i> value &lt; 0.05 is considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using
               the statistical package SPSS v 20.0.

            <h3>2.2. Laparoscopic Procedure</h3>
            <p>Under general anesthesia, a 5 mm umbilical trocar was introduced via the open Hasson
               technique, in order to create a port for a 30-degree laparoscope. Carbon dioxide was
               insufflated to a pressure between 6 and 8 mmHg. The liver and gallbladder were examined
               under direct laparoscopic vision with the help of tilting the operating table 45-degree
               reverse-Trendelenburg. Under direct vision of the telescope, a Chiba needle was inserted
               percutaneously into the gallbladder via transpassing the liver without gallbladder
               dissection (Figures 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</span> and 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</span>). A few milliliters of contrast agent was injected into the gallbladder while fluoroscopic
               radiograms are being obtained (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). If the biliary ducts were patent, with the 18G tru-cut biopsy needle, liver biopsy
               was taken under telescopic vision (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</span>). In cases of biliary atresia, laparotomy was performed to proceed with Kasai portoenterostomy.

         <title>3. Results</title>
         <p>From December 2007 to December 2014, 61 infants with prolonged jaundice were referred
            to us from the Department of Pediatrics. Thirty-seven males and 24 females were all
            referred with pale stool and severe skin icterus. The mean age at first admission
            to pediatric department was 17.0 ± 12.5 (1–42, median 18 days) days and the mean age
            at referral to Pediatric Surgery Department was 76.3 ± 25.2 (33–157, median 72 days)
            days. The time period from the beginning of prolonged-jaundice work-up with nonsurgical
            investigations till surgical evaluation was 59.3 ± 26.4 days (17–141, median 57 days)
            for all the patients and 62.7 ± 28.3 (21–141, median 56.5 days) days for the patients
            who had biliary atresia.
         </p>
         <p>The cholangiography technique was laparoscopy-assisted in 23 patients and was via
            laparotomy in the remaining 38. The technique to be applied was determined by preference
            of the senior surgeon. When the fibrotic gallbladder was observed, either with laparoscopy
            (
            <i>n</i>: 5) or with laparotomy (
            <i>n</i>: 9), portoenterostomy was performed without cholangiography. Thirty of 61 (49.2%)
            prolonged-jaundice patients, who were detected to have biliary atresia, underwent
            Kasai portoenterostomy. Thirty-one of the patients had patency of ducts. Single-port
            laparoscopy-assisted percutaneous cholangiography was performed in 18 patients. Six
            of them were diagnosed to have biliary atresia. The remaining 12 were detected to
            have patent biliary ducts and tru-cut liver biopsy was performed (Group I). In two
            infants, an additional 5 mm trocar was needed to be inserted, in order to retract
            the dilated intestinal loops in one and to occlude the distal choledochus with grasper
            in an effort to direct the contrast agent flow into the intrahepatic ducts in the
            other.
         </p>
         <p>Twenty-nine patients had cholangiography via laparotomy; biliary atresia was detected
            in 10 patients and the operation proceeded to portoenterostomy. Patency of the ducts
            was observed in 19 patients and they were followed on with liver biopsy (Group II).
            
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5</span> shows the data flow chart.
         </p>
         <p>In Group I, 12 (66.7%) of 18 patients had patent biliary ducts confirmed by laparoscopy-assisted
            cholangiography and unnecessary laparotomy was avoided. In Group II, 19 of 29 (65.5%)
            patients had patency of the ducts confirmed by open cholangiography.

            ± 32.6 minutes (30–120, median 55) in Group I and 148.4 ± 65.2 minutes (60–300, median
            150) in Group II. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant
            (
            <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The postoperative initial feeding time was 44.8 ± 41.8 hours (6–120, median
            24 hours) in Group I and 91.0 ± 29.5 (48–168, median 96 hours) hours in Group II.
            The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (
            <i>p</i> = 0.003). The postoperative full feeding achievement time was 66.3 ± 39.7 (24–144,
            median 48 hours) hours in Group I and 119.0 ± 30.5 (78–192, median 116 hours) hours
            in Group II. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (
            <i>p</i> = 0.001). Postoperative problem-free full feeding achievement parameter presumed
            the time period of follow-up by pediatric surgeon. In other words, after the achievement
            of full feeding, the surgical follow-up in pediatric units ended.

         <title>4. Discussion</title>
         <p>The age of the patient with biliary atresia at surgery is the most important determining
            factor of the postoperative long-term survival. Performing portoenterostomy before
            30, 31 to 60, 61 to 90, 91 to 120, and after 120 days has 5-year-survival rates of
            62.5%, 43.6%, 39.5%, 28.6%, and 28.8%, respectively [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In our series, the mean age at first admission to the pediatrician is 17.0 ± 12.5
            (1–42, median 18) days and the mean age during the surgical exploration is 76.3 ±
            25.2 (33–157, median 72) days. The mean delay time during pediatricians' nonsurgical
            investigations is 59.3 ± 26.4 (17–141, median 57) days. Acting by right reason of
            the invasiveness and morbidity of the laparotomy, pediatricians usually prefer to
            refer the patient to the pediatric surgeon to exclude the biliary atresia after all
            their nonsurgical investigations are complete. According to our series, 30 of 61 (49.2%)
            of prolonged-jaundiced patients had biliary atresia and the remaining 31 (50.8%) had
            unnecessary explorations, which supports pediatricians' hesitation. On the other hand,
            for the 30 patients with biliary atresia, there had been a mean delay of 62.7 ± 28.3
            days, which can also be considered as wasted time, because avoidance of such a delay
            and early operation could have meant a longer life expectancy of higher quality.
         </p>
         <p>In 1980, Hirsig and Rickham performed laparoscopy in 9 children with direct hyperbilirubinemia
            and reported their opinion that cholangiography with liver biopsy can be carried out
            by laparoscopy within the first 4 weeks of life and pointed out the importance of
            the early cholangiographic evaluation [

            cholangiogram with single umbilical port and if the cholangiogram excludes the biliary
            atresia additional 3 trocars were inserted and liver biopsy was taken with intracorporal

            not need to take liver biopsy intracorporally via inserting additional trocars. In
            other series, during laparoscopic evaluation, cholangiogram was reported to be performed
            either by exteriorizing the gallbladder through the incision of the working port [

                  <a href="#B8">8</a>

            </span>]. They proposed a screening algorithm after all standard work-up is done and resulted
            in being nondiagnostic. This standard work-up included ultrasound, laboratory tests
            (TORCH work-up, cultures, etc.),  and screening for cystic fibrosis, hypothyroidism,
            galactosemia, and other metabolic and genetic conditions. We think that all these
            investigations take a long time that can also be considered as a delayed time.
         </p>
         <p>The weakness of the current study is that we could not compare the groups with the
            length of stay and cost. We think that the reason is the heterogeneity of the variables
            from individual patient's comorbidities, referral and discharge practices outside
            of our clinic within the hospital, precludes us from such comparison.
         </p>
         <p>Our experience suggests that, with shorter duration of operation, more quickly achieved
            full enteral feeding, and better cosmesis, the pediatricians could confidently refer
            the prolonged-jaundice patients to the surgery team earlier, without waiting for the
            results, but during their investigation for the metabolic disorders or infectious
            disease, so that a timely laparoscopic evaluation could supply an efficient contribution
            to the patients.

         <title>5. Conclusion</title>
         <p>Etiological investigation of prolonged jaundice in infants is often a hard, time-consuming
            work for pediatricians. Prognosis in biliary atresia highly depends on the patient's
            age during operation. Waiting for the results of the investigation for the nonsurgical
            causes of prolonged jaundice is an important reason of delay of biliary atresia treatment.
            To prevent such a loss of time, pediatricians can be convinced with early referral
