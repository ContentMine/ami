         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Sporotrichosis is a subacute or chronic granulomatous mycosis caused by fungus of
            the
            <i> Sporothrix schenckii</i> complex. It is considered to be a rare condition in most parts of the world. It mostly
            causes cutaneous infection but can also cause multisystemic disease. Unlike most deep
            cutaneous mycoses which have a primary pulmonary focus, it is usually caused by direct
            inoculation of the fungus into the skin causing a classical linear, lymphocutaneous
            nodular eruption. However, atypical presentations of the condition can occur especially
            in immunosuppressed individuals. We report the case of a severely immunosuppressed
            female who presented with disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis which was initially
            diagnosed and treated as disseminated cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Sporotrichosis is a subacute or chronic granulomatous mycosis caused by fungus of
            the
            <i> Sporothrix schenckii</i> complex (including
            <i> S. albicans</i>,
            <i> S. brasiliensis</i>,
            <i> S. globosa</i>,
            <i> S. luriei</i>,
            <i> S. mexicana</i>, and
            <i> S. schenckii</i>) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. It occurs worldwide particularly in tropical/subtropical areas and temperate zones
            with warm and humid climates favoring the growth of saprophytic fungus. Cutaneous
            infection falls in the category of deep cutaneous mycoses. Unlike most deep cutaneous
            mycoses, infection is primarily through direct inoculation in the skin rather than
            dissemination from a primary pulmonary focus.
         </p>
         <p>Since infection occurs following traumatic implantation of the causative fungus (naturally
            found in soil, plants, hay, and sphagnum moss), the most common clinical presentations
            include lymphocutaneous and fixed-cutaneous sporotrichosis occurring in persons handling
            soil or decaying plant material (miners, farmers, gardeners, florists, foresters,
            etc.) [

            </span>]. Occasionally, inhalation of conidia may occur and cause pulmonary and disseminated
            infection [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. However, zoonotic transmission of the mycosis from infected animals like cats may
            also occur.
         </p>
         <p>Disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis or involvement of multiple visceral organs occurs
            most commonly in persons with immunosuppression [

            </span>]. However, there have been no documented cases of sporotrichosis in Zambia despite
            having a large burden of HIV disease. In this paper, we report the case of a 27-year-old
            HIV-positive female with severe immunosuppression who presented with atypical skin
            lesions of disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis initially diagnosed and treated as
            disseminated cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 27-year-old female was referred from a primary health care centre to the University
            Teaching Hospital (UTH) with a 3-week history of ill health. She complained of general
            body malaise, fever, night sweats, and a skin rash. She described the skin rash as
            having begun on the nose and subsequently spread to involve the upper limbs and trunk.
            She was also HIV-positive and had been commenced on antiretroviral therapy at the
            primary health care centre prior to presentation. Her baseline CD4 count was unknown.
            She had previously worked as a gardener for several years.
         </p>
         <p>On physical examination, she was pale, chronically ill looking, and wasted. She had
            multiple, annular, hyperpigmented (purplish-black), slightly raised papules and plaques.
            A few lesions were ulcerated. The lesions were widespread but mostly involving the
            face, upper limbs, and trunk (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</span>). The rest of the examination was unremarkable.
         </p>
         <p>Baseline investigations were done. Chest X-ray was normal. The full blood count revealed
            severe anemia with a pancytopenia for which she was given a blood transfusion. Upon
            further questioning, she admitted to receiving a cycle of anticancer chemotherapy.
            Her renal function tests as well as liver function tests were all normal (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
            </span>). Her CD4 count was 43 cells/
            <i>µ</i>L. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of disseminated cutaneous KS was made based on
            the skin lesions and HIV-induced immunosuppression, and a skin biopsy was done. During
            the course of the admission, the skin lesions were noted to be increasing in number
            and size. The patient was empirically given triple-agent anticancer chemotherapy for
            KS whilst awaiting histopathology results. No improvement was noted on anticancer
            chemotherapy and the patient once again developed severe anemia which was treated
            with blood transfusion and hematinics.
         </p>
         <p>The histology showed a dermal nonspecific mixed inflammatory infiltrate which was
            predominantly chronic (lymphocytes and plasma cells). In and amongst the aggregates
            of inflammatory cells were round-shaped yeast organisms consistent with sporotrichosis.
            The overlying epidermis showed a mild degree of hyperplasia (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>).
         </p>
         <p>It was not possible to do the fungal culture immediately due to unavailability of
            culture media. The patient had a normal chest X-ray, no central nervous system manifestations,
            no joint pains, no bony lesions, and no pulmonary symptoms and signs. In the absence
            of symptoms and signs of other organ systems (despite anemia and pancytopenia attributed
            to anticancer chemotherapy) the condition was thought to only affect the skin, and
            no thorough systemic evaluations were indicated.
         </p>
         <p>Our final diagnosis was disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis. The patient was commenced
            on Itraconazole 200 mg once daily in addition to her antiretroviral therapy. Improvement
            in the skin lesions and general condition was noted after three months of therapy.
            The lesions became flat, and the nodules disappeared, leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmented
            patches (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</span>).

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Although HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of developing potentially life-threatening
            disseminated deep fungal infections, sporotrichosis is encountered relatively infrequently
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. There is limited data on HIV/AIDS and sporotrichosis coinfection. When it does
            occur, it is mostly disseminated and the CD4 count is usually very low [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Our patient presented with clinical and histopathological features highly suggestive
            of disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis with no evidence of extracutaneous involvement.
            Considering that the patient was a gardener, it is possible that she was infected
            by accidental inoculation of the fungus at the primary site of disease.
         </p>
         <p>Our patient was initially misdiagnosed as a case of KS. This is not surprising considering
            the purplish-black skin lesions that can easily give an impression of KS and the high
            prevalence of KS in our setting. Furthermore, the subtype of sporotrichosis that she
            had, the HIV-induced immunosuppression, and the effect of the anticancer chemotherapy
            may also have led to the misleading atypical clinical features. In immunocompetent
            individuals and those with the common classical lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis, clinical
            diagnosis is usually easy.
         </p>
         <p>Culture is the gold standard in diagnosis and is also the most sensitive [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, when culture is not feasible, histopathology can also be very useful,
            like in our patient, where characteristic histopathology features can guide the diagnosis
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Other fungal organisms that may show a similar histopathological picture include
            <i> Histoplasma capsulatum</i>,
            <i> Cryptococcus </i>species, and
            <i> Blastomyces dermatitidis</i>. Unlike sporotrichosis, histoplasmosis is mainly airborne, and the disseminated form
            may also affect the mucous membranes. Yeasts of cryptococcosis have variable sizes
            and appear to have a clear halo on histology, with skin lesions mainly presenting
            as umbilicated papules with a central hemorrhagic crust.
            <i> Blastomyces dermatitidis</i> infection shows larger, broad-based yeasts on histology, with skin lesions presenting
            as painless verrucous ulcers. In addition, purely skin involvement without pulmonary
            involvement is highly unusual in histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and blastomycosis.
         </p>
         <p>Treatment for sporotrichosis in immunocompetent hosts is well established. Itraconazole
            is the drug of choice for cutaneous, lymphocutaneous, and osteoarticular sporotrichosis.
            Fluconazole can also be used but is less effective than Itraconazole. Amphotericin
            B is required for severe pulmonary infection and disseminated systemic sporotrichosis
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Our patient was commenced on daily Itraconazole with significant clinical improvement
            noted after about six to eight weeks of treatment. In addition, initiation of highly
            active antiretroviral therapy was also an integral part in improving clinical response
            and promoting an adequate immune reconstitution.
         </p>
         <p>Sporotrichosis is regarded to be a very rare disease in Zambia. Nonclassical forms
            occurring in HIV patients pose a great diagnostic challenge. Clinicians should have
            a high index of suspicion especially in immunosuppressed individuals who present with
            atypical skin lesions such as those seen in our patient. When sporotrichosis is suspected,
            ideally a culture should be obtained. In cases such as ours, where obtaining a culture
            is not possible, a presumptive diagnosis can be made based on highly suggestive clinical
            and histopathologic findings and treatment should be initiated. Should the patient
            not respond to treatment, alternative diagnoses should be strongly considered.
