         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Background</i>. Laboratory diagnosis of malaria is the key for effective disease management. Diagnosis
            of malaria infection requires rapid, sensitive, and specific test methods with an
            affordable cost. This study was aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of Partec
            rapid malaria test with reference to light microscopy for the diagnosis of malaria
            in Northwest Ethiopia.
            <i> Methods</i>. A total of 180 febrile patients were tested for malaria using Giemsa stain microscopy
            and Partec rapid malaria test from June to July 2013 at Gendewuha health centers,
            Metema district. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Odds
            ratio with 95% CI was calculated.
            <i> Result</i>. The sensitivity and specificity of Partec rapid malaria test were 93.8% (95% CI
            = 87.1%–100%) and 87.9% (95% CI = 79.7%–96.1%), respectively, while the positive predictive
            value and negative predictive value were 6.4% (95% CI = 77.2%–95.5%) and 94.6% (95%
            CI = 88.7%–100%), respectively. There was also an excellent agreement between two
            tests with Kappa value of 0.811 (95% CI = 0.625–0.996).
            <i> Conclusion</i>. Partec rapid malaria test showed good sensitivity and specificity with an excellent
            agreement to the reference light microscopy. Therefore PT can be considered as alternative
            diagnostic tools in malaria endemic areas.

         <title>1. Background</title>
         <p>Malaria is the most common fatal disease in the world. According to 2013 WHO malaria
            report, an estimated 3.4 billion people were at risk of malaria globally and populations
            living in sub-Saharan Africa have the highest risk of acquiring malaria. Approximately
            80% of cases and 90% of deaths are estimated to occur in the African region [

                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In Ethiopia approximately 52 million people (68%) live in malaria risk areas.
            <i> Plasmodium falciparum</i> and
            <i> P. vivax</i> are the dominant species of malaria in Ethiopia, with 60% and 40% relative frequencies,
            respectively.
            <i> P. falciparum</i> is the most dominant species in endemic areas and causes severe and complicated disease
            and death [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>In Ethiopia half a million microscopically confirmed cases of malaria are reported
            to the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) in each year from basic health services.
            However, the actual number of malaria cases in the country is estimated to be more
            than 5 million each year [

         <p>Clinical diagnosis is the most widely used diagnostic method in rural areas and where

            </span>]. However, according to WHO 2011 guidelines clinical diagnosis of malaria based on
            signs and symptoms alone is not recommended since it has low specificity and increases
            the chances of the patient being misdiagnosed and leads to misuse of drugs [

               and there is no need of reagent preparation. Furthermore, the CyScope florescence
               microscope is battery operated; the battery can be kept on for 6 hours after full
               charge making it best for field work. It is easier to use and to adjust and can be
               switched from UV light to bright field. However, the PT is not suitable for species
               identification and parasitic load determination and blood films cannot be stored for
               a long period of time.

            malaria test had high PPV and NPV. Thus, a high NPV indicates that a person does not
            have the disease with high certainty, meaning that PT is reliable test method in diagnosing
            of malaria parasites.
         </p>
         <p>Partec rapid malaria test had detected 12 cases which were negative by light microscopy.
            Unlike Giemsa stain light microscopy, PT has sensitive fluorescent dye, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
            (DAPI), which can be detected in such low level of parasites. In addition, the presence
            of artifacts such as nonspecific aggregated DAPI, immature erythrocytes, or bacterial
            cells might have been misinterpreted as
            <i> Plasmodium</i> DNA [

            </span>]. On the other hand, PT produced 5 false negative results which were positive by
            light microscopy. This might be due to the fact that unlysed red blood cells may lie
            on each other or overlap with each other thereby preventing parasites in red blood
            cells that may be lying beneath other cells. The performance characteristics of the
            tests were very similar as indicated in their sensitivities, specificities, PPV, and
            NPV with very good agreements to the light microscopy.
         </p>
         <p>Determination of parasitemia with Partec rapid malaria test is difficult, because
            the red blood cell may overlap each other and make the parasites invisible under the
            UV light. This finding is in line with the finding of the study conducted in Ghana
            [

            endemic areas.
         </p>
         <p>The overall prevalence of malaria in the study area was very high, as detected by
            both the LM (45%) and the PT (48.9%). This result is higher than the report from other
            regions in Ethiopia [

         <title>5. Conclusion</title>
         <p>Partec rapid malaria test showed good sensitivity and specificity with an excellent
            agreement to the reference light microscopy. PT has very short turnaround times, requires
            little training, and is applicable under field conditions. Therefore PT can be considered
            as alternative diagnostic tools in malaria endemic areas. Further studies are needed
            to determine the cost-effectiveness and long term performance of the Partec rapid
            malaria test in diagnosing malaria.
