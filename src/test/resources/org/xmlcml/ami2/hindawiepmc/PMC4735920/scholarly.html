         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Suicide attempt via sodium pentobarbital is uncommon. A 48-year-old woman with a history
            of depression and prior suicide attempt was found unresponsive by her veterinarian
            spouse near a syringe containing pink solution. Upon EMS' arrival, the patient was
            experiencing apnea, hypoxemia, and miotic pupils; her blood glucose level measured
            73 mg/dL. She was bradycardic and administered atropine with transient improvement
            in heart rate and transported to an emergency department; 2 mg of intravenous naloxone
            was administered without effect. She was endotracheally intubated via rapid sequence
            intubation. Rapid urine drug screening detected both benzodiazepines and barbiturates.
            The patient was transferred to an intensive care unit where she demonstrated a nearly
            absent radial pulse. Emergent fasciotomy to the left forearm and carpal tunnel was
            performed for acute compartment syndrome; “Euthasol” had been self-administered into
            the antecubital fossa. Expanded toxicological analysis via liquid chromatography/mass
            spectroscopy detected caffeine, atropine, 7-aminoclonazepam, phenytoin, citalopram,
            and naproxen. The patient's coma resolved over 48 hours and she was successfully extubated
            without complication. Emergency physicians must closely monitor patients exposed to
            veterinary euthanasia agents who develop central nervous system and respiratory depression,
            hypothermia, bradycardia, hypotension, or skin injury. Consultation with a regional
            poison center and medical toxicologist is recommended.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Suicide attempt via self-administration of sodium pentobarbital is extremely uncommon
            but may occur in those who have access to veterinary medications. The dramatic presentations
            of barbiturate-associated poisoning are often accompanied by characteristic history
            and physical findings that can facilitate early identification and treatment of these
            potentially lethal overdoses. A unique case of a patient suffering from sodium pentobarbital
            toxicity after intravenous injection is described.

         <title>2. Case Presentation</title>
         <p>A 48-year-old woman with a history of depression and prior suicide attempt who was
            prescribed clonazepam and citalopram was found by her veterinarian spouse unresponsive
            at home at approximately 10:30 pm. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated by
            the husband due to observed apnea while awaiting EMS' arrival. A syringe containing
            a pink solution with a needle attached was found adjacent to the patient and appeared
            to have been used to inject the patient's left antecubital fossa. A suicide note and
            an empty bottle of 2 mg clonazepam tablets were also found at the scene. Upon EMS'
            arrival, the patient had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of “3” with apnea, hypoxemia,
            and miotic pupils. Her blood glucose level measured 73 mg/dL. She was bradycardic
            and was administered atropine on scene with transient improvement in heart rate.
         </p>
         <p>The patient was rapidly transported to a local emergency department. Her vital signs
            on arrival included a heart rate of 46 beats per minute, blood pressure 99/53 mmHg,
            agonal respirations, temperature 94.6°F, and room air pulse oximetry of 78%. Physical
            examination revealed a GCS of “3,” pupils measuring 3 mm and being sluggishly reactive,
            and a taught, “dusky” left forearm with delayed capillary refill distal to a left
            antecubital vein injection site. Two milligrams of intravenous naloxone was administered
            without effect, and she was then endotracheally intubated via rapid sequence intubation.
            Computed tomography of her head demonstrated no hemorrhage, mass, or ischemic change.
            Serum creatinine phosphokinase and ethanol measured 806 U/L and 58 mg/dL, respectively.
            Complete metabolic panel, serum salicylate, and acetaminophen levels were unremarkable.
            Rapid urine drug screening detected both benzodiazepines and barbiturates. The patient
            was then transferred to a local tertiary care facility for further management.
         </p>
         <p>Upon arrival to the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient was evaluated by the surgical
            service. After clinical examination with a nearly absent radial pulse on Doppler examination,
            she underwent emergent fasciotomy of the left forearm and carpal tunnel for acute
            compartment syndrome. Contemporaneous discussion with her spouse revealed that the
            pink solution found in the syringe, which had been transported with the patient, was
            Euthasol (390 mg/mL pentobarbital and 50 mg/mL phenytoin; see 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>) and had been stolen from his on-site, secured pharmacy. The previously unused 100 mg
            vial was missing approximately 8 mL of solution.
         </p>
         <p>Serum pentobarbital and phenytoin levels were drawn on arrival at the ICU and measured
            12.6 
            <i>μ</i>g/mL (1.0–5.0 
            <i>μ</i>g/mL) and 2.5 
            <i>μ</i>g/mL (10–20 
            <i>μ</i>g/mL), respectively. Serum cell counts with differential, electrolytes, renal function,
            and liver enzymes were all within normal limits. Serum creatinine phosphokinase measured
            1057 U/L (26–192 U/L). Expanded toxicological screening at the receiving hospital
            via liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy detected caffeine, atropine, 7-aminoclonazepam,
            phenytoin, citalopram, and naproxen.
         </p>
         <p>The patient's coma resolved over the following 48 hours, and she was successfully
            extubated on hospital day three. Serum pentobarbital levels declined to 8.6 (at 12
            hours), 6.4 (at 24 hours), and 2.1 
            <i>μ</i>g/mL (at 48 hours) at time of extubation. Serum creatinine phosphokinase peaked at
            4727 U/L. The plastic surgery service was consulted to repair the fasciotomy surgical
            wounds. The patient was ultimately evaluated by a psychiatrist, who made the diagnoses
            of mood disorder not otherwise specified, suicide attempt secondary to mood disorder,
            and alcohol use disorder. She was discharged to an inpatient facility in good condition
            on hospital day thirteen without neurologic sequelae.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Pentobarbital is a short-acting barbiturate currently utilized to initiate and maintain
            medically induced coma, as well as for management of elevated intracranial pressure,
            particularly in the setting of traumatic brain injury [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In the United States' judicial system, the drug is utilized as a means of lethal
            injection in humans. Veterinarians administer pentobarbital most frequently for euthanasia
            purposes.
         </p>
         <p>Barbiturates are derivatives of barbituric acid and are classified as either short-
            or long-acting. The short-acting barbiturates (e.g., pentobarbital) when compared
            to long-acting agents differ by more rapid onset, higher pKa values, are more protein
            bound and lipid soluble, have a shorter duration of action, and undergo more hepatic
            metabolism. Pentobarbital possesses a duration of action of three to four hours and
            a variable elimination half-life of 15 to 48 hours [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. These generalizations, however, may be misleading in overdose as the severity and
            time course following barbiturate overdose vary greatly, and toxicokinetics are encountered
            rather than expected pharmacokinetics [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>There are several distinguishing physical examination and historical features regarding
            barbiturate toxicity. Cutaneous manifestations of barbiturate toxicity are not uncommon
            and include barbiturate blisters or bullae and dermal discoloration with necrosis
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. These can result from extravascular injection or prolonged external compression,
            both of which may be accompanied by rhabdomyolysis [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Other well-described clinical features of barbiturate overdose are hypothermia
            and cardiovascular collapse, with bradycardia and refractory hypotension [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Furthermore, respiratory depression or embarrassment may be evident in the barbiturate-poisoned
            patient unlike other sedative-hypnotic medications, such as benzodiazepines. Historical
            clues that suggest barbiturate toxicity include access to professional veterinary
            euthanasia agents, as illustrated in this case [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B11">11</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Delayed complications of barbiturate toxicity in survivors include aspiration with
            and without pneumonia, pulmonary edema, cerebral edema and infarct, and multiorgan
            failure [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Concentrated solutions of sodium pentobarbital are routinely used for the purposes
            of animal euthanasia because of rapid onset of action and efficacy (see 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
            </span>) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Solutions often contain greater than 300 mg/mL sodium pentobarbital. Intravenous
            injection in humans and animals results in rapid coma, respiratory depression, hypotension,
            bradycardia, and hypothermia. These effects lead to prompt induction of asystole and
            death. While the majority of these agents are administered intravenously, they are
            also efficacious via oral, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal routes. It has been reported
            that oral doses of sodium pentobarbital as little as 100 mg can induce hypnosis in
            adults, which substantially increases the lethality of unsecured concentrated veterinary
            formulations [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Concentrated veterinary solutions (and lower-dose formulations utilized for human
            use) often contain chemical vehicles, which—while facilitating administration of the
            medication—can also have significant side effects. These diluents are often alcohol
            derivatives, for instance, isopropanol, ethanol, and propylene glycol. Side effects
            of these additives include potentiation of the sedative-hypnotic effects of the barbiturate
            and metabolic derangements such as lactic acidosis documented from propylene glycol
            additives [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">13</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Several formulations of pentobarbital-containing veterinary euthanasia agents have
            varying types of Vaughan-Williams Class-Ib antiarrhythmics, most frequently phenytoin
            sodium. According to the Euthasol package insert, the rapid administration of these
            agents reportedly produces cardiotoxic effects during the anesthesia stage of euthanasia
            by “hastening the cessation of electrical activity of the heart” via interference
            with myocardial sodium channel function. In this patient, the clinical toxicity observed
            stemmed directly from sedative-hypnotic toxicity and likely very little from the phenytoin.
         </p>
         <p>Similar to other medications in the sedative-hypnotic class, the treatment for barbiturate
            overdose remains primarily supportive. If toxic amounts were ingested orally, activated
            charcoal could be considered, but, given the potential for significant CNS depression
            and subsequent aspiration, the benefit appears small [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">14</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Pentobarbital metabolism occurs primarily via hydroxylation and glucuronidation
            in the liver, and excretion occurs primarily in the kidneys. Alkaline diuresis does
            not enhance excretion because of the high pKa of the short-acting barbiturates [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Hemodialysis appears to be less effective for the short-acting agents compared
            to long-acting ones and is described as “moderately dialyzable” [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B15">15</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The patient described in this case report improved spontaneously with meticulous
            supportive care and maintained normal renal function, so hemodialysis was deemed unnecessary.
         </p>
         <p>Pentobarbital poisoning is extremely uncommon but still can be lethal. Emergency physicians
            must be cognizant of patients who develop CNS and respiratory depression, hypothermia,
            bradycardia, hypotension, or skin injury, especially in the setting of exposure to
            veterinary euthanasia agents. Meticulous intensive care is the mainstay of treatment
            with attention to respiratory and cardiovascular support, and high flux hemodialysis
            may enhance elimination in severe, refractory cases. Consultation with both a regional
            poison center and a medical toxicologist is recommended.
