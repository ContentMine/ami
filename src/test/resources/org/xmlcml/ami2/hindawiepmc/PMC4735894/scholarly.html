         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Myxoma, a rare type of intracardiac tumor, forms a very small percentage of the cardiac
            cases. Reports of biatrial myxoma are rarer, with cases of single tumor reaching both
            atria being more common. Here, we present an unusual case of two independently growing
            atrial myxoma in a 29-year-old female. We emphasize that early recognition of symptoms,
            confirmation of diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography, and prompt surgical
            excision remain vital in the management of such patients. The patient in the present
            case was managed successfully with no evidences of recurrence at the last follow-up.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Myxoma is a rare type of intracardiac tumor with an incidence of 0.0017% among the
            general population [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">

                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The left atrium is the most common site of origin of cardiac myxoma (75–80%), followed
            by right atrium (10–20%). Multiple myxoma represent 5% of all cardiac myxoma, of which
            half (2.5%) are of bilateral origin [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>

            </span>]. According to the available literature, only a few cases of biatrial myxoma have
            been reported so far, and they generally describe a single tumor reaching both atria
            [

            in a young female.

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 29-year-old female presented to our institute with class III dyspnea and a history
            of cough for the past 1 year. She denied any past history of cardiac illness. Cardiac
            auscultation revealed a middiastolic murmur across mitral valve, followed by a tumor
            plop. Patient's electrocardiogram (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>) showed normal sinus rhythm; right axis deviation; and T-wave inversion in leads
            III and V1–4. Her pulse rate was 110 beats/min. Subsequently, transthoracic echocardiography
            in the emergency room revealed left atrium enlargement with an evidence of left atrial
            mass prolapsing through the mitral valve during diastole. The enlarged left atrial
            mass was probably attached to the interatrial septum. In addition, there were signs
            of mild eccentric mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Left
            ventricle was of normal size with intact ventricular septum. The patient was further
            analyzed by transesophageal echocardiography. It revealed large left atrial mass attached
            to the interatrial septum (size: 6.6 × 3.1 cm; 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</span>), with mobility into and out of the left ventricular inflow. Of significance, another
            mass was also evident in the right atrium (size: 1 × 1 cm; 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</span>). Mitral valve appeared structurally normal. Notably, the right atrial mass was a
            separate entity and was not attached to interatrial septum. Immediate operation was
            indicated and the patient was scheduled for the surgical excision of these masses
            with cardiopulmonary bypass through right atrial approach. Both atrial masses were
            removed successfully along with the interatrial septum. Further, the interatrial septum
            was replaced with a pericardial patch. Upon histopathological examination, atrial
            masses were diagnosed as cardiac myxomas based on their suggestive features. The left
            atrial myxoma measured 6.5 × 5 × 3 cm, while right atrial myxoma measured 1.2 × 0.8
            × 0.2 cm (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). According to our examinations and laboratory evaluation, hemorrhage was established
            as the most probable cause for the formation of cystic lesions seen in the masses.
            Simultaneous screening of patient's family members revealed neither a family history
            nor features suggestive of cardiac myxoma.
         </p>
         <p>Transthoracic echocardiogram performed at the 6-month follow-up in our patient revealed
            normal cardiac chambers, improved left ventricular function, and no evidence of residual
            myxoma or myxoma recurrence. The patient was kept on a yearly follow-up and she has
            remained symptom-free for about 1.5 years after the procedure.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Myxoma is the most prevalent primary tumor of the heart. Despite being benign, it
            may lead to embolic events or even sudden death. Early recognition, diagnosis, and
            prompt treatment remain vital to prevent life-threatening events in such patients
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>In general, patients with cardiac myxoma present with symptoms of hemodynamic obstruction,
            embolization, or constitutional changes. Transesophageal echocardiography is widely
            accepted as the ideal diagnostic tool for cardiac myxoma. It confirms the location
            and extension of the tumor as well as the site of attachment of the tumor. Once the
            diagnosis is established, immediate surgical treatment is indicated in all patients
            to avoid further tumor embolism and valve obstruction. Prognosis is excellent after
            surgical excision. After surgery, regular follow-up with serial echocardiography is
            also very important to detect recurrence [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>The present case is rare and particularly interesting because there were two different
            tumors, coexisting in each atrium. Initially, the diagnosis was not clearly established
            on transthoracic echocardiographic examination and the second tumor in the right atrium
            was missed. On the other hand, transesophageal echocardiography was effective at detecting
            both atrial tumors and was particularly helpful in identifying the site of tumor attachment
            and characteristics of the mass. Therefore, we recommend the use of transesophageal
            echocardiography as an ideal noninvasive diagnostic modality in cases of cardiac myxoma.
            It is estimated that the average growth rate of left atrial myxoma ranges from 1.8
            to 5.7 cm/year [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Accordingly, the patient in the present case seems to have cardiac myxoma for more
            than one year as the dimension of left atrial mass in our case was 6.6 × 3.1 cm. This
            was reflected in patients' symptoms, that is, complaints of class III dyspnea for
            1 year at the time of presentation. Other important features in our case include presentation
            of biatrial myxoma at relatively young age and absence of family history of myxoma.
            Available literature indicates that most of the cardiac myxomas are found in middle-age
            females and a small percentage of primary cardiac tumors may be familial [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Although prompt excision with high-risk cardiopulmonary bypass is the only acceptable
            mode of treatment [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>], we believe that cardiac myxomas can be excised successfully with a low rate of
            mortality and morbidity. The patient in the present case was successfully operated
            on and is not having any recurrence to date.
