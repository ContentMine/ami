         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>The algorithm of treatment of septic lateral sinus thrombosis (SLST) has undergone
            a paradigm shift with the understanding of the natural history of sigmoid sinus thrombosis.
            Thus, the recent medical literature promulgates the management of these cases with
            no sinus exploration. However, in view of marked paucity of literature on the cited
            subject, not much is known about this form of treatment. We present our experience
            of treating two paediatric cases of SLST with mastoid surgery and no sinus exploration:
            both cases had excellent recovery. Finally, conclusions are drawn in light of contemporary
            literature on this subject.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Septic lateral sinus thrombosis (SLST) is a rare complication of chronic suppurative
            otitis media (CSOM) in paediatric population (accounts for 2–20% of all intracranial
            complications) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Interestingly, the incidence of SLST has increased with the advancement in medical
            diagnostics. However, early diagnosis and use of potent antibiotics have markedly
            decreased the mortality to less than 5% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In this context, it would be important to note that the clinical presentation of
            SLST has become more subtle with the advent of potent and new antibiotics [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>

                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The complication no longer presents with classical clinical features mentioned
            in the medical text, severe wasting illness with “Picket Fence” fever.
         </p>
         <p>Management of SLST varies considerably in the literature. The traditional teaching
            has been to do a mastoid surgery with sinus exploration under antibiotic cover [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>

                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Some suggest incision of the sinus with evacuation of the clot, while others have
            adopted a more conservative approach: needle aspiration of the sinus. There is also
            no consensus among otologists on the role of anticoagulants and ligation of internal
            jugular vein [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>

                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Recent review of literature mentions the management of SLST with no sinus exploration
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>

                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Ideally, the effect of variation in sinus management on morbidity and mortality
            of SLST should be studied by a randomized control trial. However, given the limited
            number of cases of SLST such an endeavour may be difficult to achieve. With this background
            we present our modest experience of two cases of SLST which were managed by mastoid
            surgery only and no sinus exploration.

         <title>2. Case I</title>
         <p>An 8-year-old boy reported to the ENT Emergency with chief complaints of ear discharge
            and pain in the left ear with postauricular swelling. Patient also had a history of
            fever, headache, and nausea and vomiting. The patient had been suffering from CSOM
            left ear for the past 3 years and had been taking antibiotics for the same off and
            on. However, no medical records were available for the antibiotic treatment. Examination
            of the ear showed a perforation in pars flaccida, erosion of scutum with foul smelling
            discharge, and cholesteatoma flakes. In the postauricular region 4 × 2 cm boggy inflammatory
            swelling was also seen, which had pus on needle aspiration. In view of intracranial
            symptoms a medical opinion was sought and subsequent CECT scan (Contrast-Enhanced
            Computed Tomography) revealed lateral sinus thrombosis (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Hence, a final diagnosis of CSOM left ear-cholesteatoma disease with postauricular
            abscess and lateral sinus thrombosis was made. Patient underwent modified radical
            mastoidectomy with drainage of the abscess (but no sinus exploration) under antibiotic
            cover. Patient recovered satisfactorily with no untoward incident to report and was
            discharged subsequently at the end of 3 weeks. A repeat CECT scan done at the end
            of 8 weeks was normal showing recanalization of left sigmoid sinus (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>).

         <title>3. Case II</title>
         <p>An 11-year-old girl reported to the ENT OPD with the complaint of persistently discharging
            left ear for the past 3 months. In addition, for the past 10 days patient had also
            developed ear pain and persistent headache. However, patient had no other clinical
            features of raised intracranial tension. Past history revealed that this girl had
            been suffering from CSOM left ear for the last 5 years with gradually deteriorating
            hearing loss. History of rampant use of antibiotics with no medical records was also
            present. Examination of the ear revealed posterosuperior perforation in the tympanic
            membrane (involving both pars tensa and the adjoining pars flaccida) with granulations
            and cholesteatoma flakes. The Griesinger sign was positive. A CT scan of this patient
            revealed destructive bony changes with dilated sigmoid sinus with partial hypodense
            filling defect on left side: lateral sinus thrombosis (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>). Thus, a diagnosis of CSOM left ear-cholesteatoma disease with lateral sinus thrombosis
            was made. An urgent modified radical mastoidectomy (no sinus exploration) was under
            antibiotic cover. The patient was discharged at the end of 3 weeks with excellent
            prognosis.

         <p>It would be prudent to note that “ear swabs” were sterile and “hypercoagulability”
            was absent in both cases. Both patients were treated initially with a combination
            of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid and metronidazole intravenously for duration of
            2 weeks, followed by oral antibiotics for the next two weeks.

         <title>4. Discussion</title>
         <p>Some clinical observations regarding these cases merit discussion. Both of our cases
            had a history of protracted CSOM with abuse of antibiotics. The medical literature
            cites antibiotic resistance as an important cause for aetiopathogenesis of SLST [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Further, both the cases had an actively discharging ear at the time of diagnosis
            of this complication, thereby implying that “Acute Suppurative Otitis Media (ASOM)”
            is an important predisposing factor. Several studies have also delineated the role
            of ASOM in causing intracranial complications [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Both cases had an atypical clinical presentation and were diagnosed on CT scan.
            Although literature is replete with references that suggest “hypercoagulability” as
            an important predisposing factor for OLST [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

            </span>], no “hypercoagulability” state was detected in any of our patients.
         </p>
         <p>Although we diagnosed these cases by CT scan, “Magnetic Radio Imaging (MRI)” is regarded
            as a more sensitive investigation to diagnose SLST. However, this should be performed
            in conjunction with CT scan to evaluate associated otologic and cerebral pathology
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">

            </span>]. Despite the advantages of MRI, its cost and selective availability, especially
            in developing countries, limit its use and it is thus mandatory only in those suspicious
            cases where CT scan fails to demonstrate the thrombus. This view has been endorsed
            by other otologists too [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">

         <p>There is considerable controversy regarding surgical management of SLST: the role
            of mastoid surgery is also not fully characterized. Further, there is marked surgical
            dilemma regarding the involved thrombosed sinus: many advocate incision of sinus with
            removal of the clot, while other simply unroof the sinus and confirm the presence
            of thrombus with needle aspiration. Both of our cases of SLST had excellent recovery
            after mastoid surgery only. In no case the involved sinus was explored. This treatment
            is based on the principle that thrombus formation is secondary to infection, and thus
            treatment of infection is the core management issue (not the thrombus). It is reasoned
            that formation of thrombus is a protective mechanism attempting to localize infection,
            and the natural history of SLST is of resolution. The venous occlusion resolves by
            4 to 6 weeks with adequate antibiotic treatment only (no adjuvant surgery or anticoagulant
            therapy is required). Thus, once the source of infection is eradicated, the thrombus
            resolves [

               <sup>

            </span>]. However, it would be pertinent to note that the definitive treatment for CSOM-cholesteatoma
            disease is surgery [

            the disease along with antibiotics.
         </p>
         <p>In accordance with aforesaid principle, some otologists have also reported a favourable
            outcome in patients of SLST by removal of surrounding granulation tissue and inflammation
            around the sinus (reducing the thrombophilic nidus) with clot left untouched [

            </span>]. We would thus like to emphasise the adjuvant role of antibiotics in cases of SLST.
            In both of our cases antibiotics were used for a long duration (up to 4 weeks) along
            with mastoid surgery to get good prognosis.
         </p>
         <p>Given the success of mastoid surgery under antibiotic cover in both of our cases,
            we conclude that SLST in CSOM-cholesteatoma disease requires mastoid surgery with
            no sinus exploration. However, many questions regarding management of SLST still remain
            unanswered. We cite our modest experience in two cases as a template for future research
            and modification in the best interest of patient care.
         </p>
         <p>In summary, we present this clinical record on account of (i) rarity of the cited
            complication, (ii) its unique management by excluding sinus exploration, and (iii)
            underreporting of this management in English medical literature, which limits conclusions
            to be drawn on the treatment of OLST in accordance with evidence based medicine.
