         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>A patient at 38 weeks of gestation when taken for emergency cesarean section had her
            oxygen saturation of 66 to 70% (by saturation probe on monitor) in operation theatre.
            She was otherwise asymptomatic but her oxygen saturation was persistently low on the
            monitors. Her arterial blood gas analysis showed all parameters to be normal. Her
            electrocardiography was normal. Her surgery was imperative but due to her reduced
            oxygen saturation she became a high-risk case. In presence of senior consultants of
            anesthesia and gynecology and under high-risk consent she had an uneventful cesarean
            delivery. Physician and cardiologist opinions were sought thereafter. The outcomes
            and the results of our efforts to find the etiology of her reduced saturation on monitors
            despite being clinically asymptomatic lead to the disclosure of this rare hemoglobinopathy.
            Mother and baby had uneventful course after delivery and were discharged well.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Methemoglobinemia is a form of hemoglobinopathy, which is characterized by the presence
            of higher than normal level of methemoglobin. In methemoglobin it is the ferric (Fe
            <sup>3+</sup>) form of iron, which is attached to globin instead of the ferrous (Fe
            <sup>2+</sup>) form. Due to this modification hemoglobin has decreased ability to bind with oxygen
            whereas there is an increased affinity of oxygen to the three other heme sites (that
            are still ferrous) within the same tetrameric hemoglobin unit. This leads to an overall
            reduced ability of the red blood cell to release oxygen to tissues; hence oxygen-hemoglobin
            dissociation curve is shifted to the left.
         </p>
         <p>Normally, methemoglobin levels are &lt;1% in blood. Elevated levels can be caused by
            reduction or disruption of protective enzyme systems (like cytochrome b5 reductase,
            diaphorase I, etc.). Excess amount of methemoglobin can cause tissue hypoxia and hence
            manifest as cyanosis [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Broadly they are classified into 2 types: congenital or hereditary and acquired
            methemoglobinemia. Acquired methemoglobinemia caused by environmental oxidizing agents
            is common; congenital form is rare [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Hereditary methemoglobinemia is caused by deficiency of NADH methemoglobin reductase
            enzyme (mostly) and is an autosomal recessive disorder. Orphanet put it in the list
            of rare diseases [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. A variant of congenital methemoglobinemia (NADH-CYB5R deficiency) is a very rare
            autosomal recessive disorder [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. The exact prevalence of hereditary methemoglobinemia is unknown as there are very
            few cases reported in the literature. Recessive hereditary methemoglobinemia further
            has two clinical types: type I (in which cyanosis is the only clinical sign) and type
            II (permanent mild cyanosis is associated with severe neurological manifestations)
            [

         <title>2. Case Summary</title>
         <p>22-year, booked patient in her second pregnancy (previous vaginal delivery) presented
            to gynaecology emergency at 38-week period of gestation with labour pains and anemia.
            She was previously admitted with us at 25 weeks of gestation, for evaluation and treatment
            of severe anemia (hemoglobin of 5.5 g/dL then). In that admission she had complaints
            of easy fatigability and weakness. After evaluation she then received a unit of blood
            and the rest of the treatment was continued with parenteral iron therapy (as peripheral
            smear showed microcytic hypochromic anemia); on discharge her hemoglobin levels improved
            (9 g/dL) and she was symptomatically better. She could not be followed up later due
            to lack of her further antenatal visits and noncompliance. Now she came back to us
            at 38 weeks at late night with labor pains. She was admitted in labor room and all
            her baseline investigations were sent. She clinically looked pale but had no cyanosis
            or respiratory discomfort. She had adequate uterine contractions and was monitored
            for progress of labor. We found her to have poor progress of labor despite adequate
            contractions and so she was prepared for emergency cesarean section. Her preoperative
            investigations showed moderate anemia (8.2 g/dL) with normal platelets and normal
            coagulation profile. After anesthesia clearance patient was taken in operation theatre
            for procedure.
         </p>
         <p>In operation theatre during her vitals and oxygen saturation monitoring, the oxygen
            saturation probe showed readings between 66 and 70% in room air. Despite change of
            saturation probe and removing all artifacts this finding was persistent on the monitor.
            The patient despite these readings was comfortable with no breathlessness, no palpitations,
            and no chest pain (absolutely asymptomatic) and on examination no significant cardiovascular
            and respiratory system findings were found. Her vitals were normal. We immediately
            sent for arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis from right radial artery, although color
            of blood was abnormally dark; even on repeat sampling reports were normal (sO
            <sub>2</sub> was normal). Absence of cyanosis and disparity between clinical picture of the patient
            and oxygen saturation on monitors alerted us and we did further evaluation prior to
            surgery. Electrocardiograph (ECG) was recorded, which was normal. Physician referral
            was sought and on call senior resident examined the patient. No significant change
            in saturation status was noticed even with high flow oxygen by mask. So under high-risk
            consent of postop mechanical ventilation and need of ICU, with anesthesia consultant
            on floor, she was given spinal anesthesia (2 mL bupivacaine given in sitting position
            by 25 G spinal needle in L3-L4 space), which was later converted to general anesthesia
            (induced with 100% oxygen on Bains). Her saturation was maintained at 72%. Cesarean
            section was uneventful with a newborn of good APGAR. After baby delivery, intraoperatively
            repeat ABG was sent, which was also normal. Postoperatively, patient was shifted to
            Intensive Care Unit on ventilation; the medicine team on call reviewed her there.
            Cardiology opinion was also sought and no underlying cardiac pathology was found.
            Physicians advised for anemia correction and to evaluate for hemoglobinopathies. She
            was given three-unit packed cell and continued on intravenous antibiotics. She was
            off ventilator after 48 hours. Despite her saturation being maintained at 65–72%,
            patient was asymptomatic and had normal ABG; this abnormal saturation was the reason
            for suspicion of hemoglobinopathy. Her blood samples were sent to higher laboratory
            outside our hospital for testing which revealed methemoglobinemia. No active intervention
            was advised by physicians for her condition as she was presently asymptomatic. She
            was discharged on the 8th postoperative day with no complications and healthy baby.
            Her baby was also evaluated though being asymptomatic and found normal. As this condition
            has genetic predisposition, the baby was subjected to evaluation.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Methemoglobinemia may be congenital or acquired [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In the congenital Homozygote's variety, the defect in methemoglobin reductase lacks
            the ability to convert methemoglobin to hemoglobin and these individuals are cyanosed
            from birth. But, in heterozygote's variety, there is partial defect in the enzyme;
            methemoglobinemia may develop when challenged with oxidative drugs [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. There is another variant of this disorder, which is rare, HbM-Iwate, formed due
            to the point mutation of alpha globin gene [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Hereditary methemoglobinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and hence is rare.
         </p>
         <p>Acquired methemoglobinemia may result from oxidant drugs including nitrites, nitrates
            (from contaminated water), aniline dyes, antimalarial drugs, and phenacetin. As the
            presence of methemoglobin shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, resulting
            in decreased unloading of oxygen to the tissues, symptoms depend on quantity of methemoglobin
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Normal adults can have methemoglobin up to 2% in the blood and its production by
            autooxidation is balanced via methemoglobin reductase. Clinically detectable cyanosis
            usually develops at levels over 10%, whereas, at 30%, hypoxia appears and levels of
            60–70% are often fatal [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Treatment of methemoglobinemia with ascorbic acid or methylene blue is effective
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Chronic mild methemoglobinemia may be completely asymptomatic and necessitate no
            specific therapy. As pregnancy is a stressful event, methemoglobin level can be increased
            during pregnancy especially during delivery and it may be normalized after delivery
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In early pregnancy it can be treated with methylene blue and vitamin C supplements.
            In this case it was diagnosed postoperatively as methemoglobinemia and as patient
            was asymptomatic no specific therapy was started.
