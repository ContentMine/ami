         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Background</i>. Hysteroscopic tubal sterilization (Essure) is a minimally invasive option for permanent
            contraception with high reported rates of patient satisfaction. A small percentage
            of these women subsequently choose to have the tubal inserts removed due to regret
            or perceived side effects such as late-onset pelvic pain secondary to placement of
            the Essure device.
            <i> Case</i>. A twenty-nine-year-old woman G4P4014 presented with a two-year complaint of chronic
            pelvic pain and dyspareunia after the hysteroscopic placement of an Essure device
            for sterilization. On reviewing the images of the HSG, it was noted that although
            tubal occlusion was confirmed, the left Essure coil appeared curved on itself in an
            elliptical fashion and did not seem to follow the expected anatomic trajectory of
            the fallopian tube. The patient reported resolution of chronic pelvic pain following
            laparoscopic removal of Essure device.
            <i> Conclusion</i>. A misplaced Essure device should be considered in the differential diagnosis of
            chronic pelvic pain in women who had difficult placement of the device. In addition
            to demonstrating tubal occlusion, careful examination of the configuration of the
            Essure microinserts on HSG examination provides valuable information in patients with
            pelvic pain after Essure placement.

         <title>2. Presentation of the Case</title>
         <p>The patient is a 29-year-old G4P4014 who delivered and elected on discharge to use
            oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) until scheduled for an interval postpartum tubal sterilization.
            The initial attempt to place the Essure device failed, because the fallopian tube
            ostia were not visualized. One month later, placement of the Essure procedure was
            successful. There were three coils seen at the ostia of the right fallopian tube and
            one coil seen in ostia of the left tube. The patient tolerated the procedure well
            and went home the day of the procedure. She had no symptoms and no complaints at the
            two-week postprocedural follow-up visit and the evaluation was unremarkable. Patient
            did not have any history of gonorrhea or chlamydia infection, nor any history of pelvic
            pain or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) prior to Essure placement.
         </p>
         <p>Patient did not keep her appointment for the three-month interval hysterosalpingogram
            (HSG) follow-up for evaluation of tubal patency; instead, the HSG was done six months
            after Essure placement and confirmed successful tubal occlusion (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>).
         </p>
         <p>Approximately two years after the successful placement of the Essure device, the patient
            presented with lower abdominal pain that she reported began gradually and became more
            frequent after the Essure was placed. The patient described the pain as constant and
            exacerbated during intercourse (dyspareunia). It was not related to menses initially,
            but overtime it began to get worse during menstruation as well. During in-office gynecologic
            examination, there was no cervical motion tenderness or significant right adnexal
            findings. However, there was left adnexal tenderness elicited during the examination.
            A normal uterus and bilateral adnexa with no free fluid were identified on pelvic
            imaging (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>). Gonorrhea and chlamydia screening remained negative. A diagnosis of left parametritis
            was made for which a 14-day course of doxycycline was given. A three-week follow-up
            evaluation with pelvic ultrasound was scheduled.
         </p>
         <p>At the three-week follow-up, the patient reported no resolution of symptoms and requested
            removal of the Essure device. Patient underwent laparoscopic bilateral total salpingectomy
            with bilateral Essure inserts removal. Laparoscopically, left fallopian tube was grasped
            with the forceps; the Essure device was identified at the isthmus and ampullary portion
            of the fallopian tube and small incision was made to expose the Essure device distal
            tip. The inner and outer coils of the Essure were removed in two complete pieces using
            the grasping forceps and then fallopian tube was excised completely using LigaSure
            device. The same procedure was performed on the contralateral side and Essure device
            and fallopian tubes were removed bilaterally.
         </p>
         <p>Intraoperative finding was notable for normal fallopian tubes and ovaries, without
            any evidence of endometriosis, adhesions, or any other pelvic pathology. The patient
            reported resolution of chronic pelvic pain following surgical removal of Essure device.
            On reviewing the images of the HSG, it was noted that although tubal occlusion was
            confirmed, the left Essure coil appeared twisted in an abnormal configuration and
            did not seem to follow the expected anatomic trajectory of the fallopian tube. Instead,
            it appeared curved on itself in an elliptical fashion (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>).
         </p>
         <p>At the one-month postoperative and subsequent interval gynecology visits, the patient
            reported complete resolution of presenting pelvic symptoms.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>The Essure device is a noninvasive, permanent option for sterilization. It is inserted
            in the office, does not require general anesthesia, and has been shown to be more
            cost effective than laparoscopic sterilization [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">

               </sup>
            </span>]. It also does not require an incision and has a lower incidence of postoperative
            pain compared to surgical sterilization techniques [

               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. The average time for the procedure is under ten minutes [

               </sup>
            </span>]. The procedure consists of placing the small, flexible Essure microinserts into
            the fallopian tubes via a catheter through the vagina and cervix. The inserts are
            made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers that cause an inflammatory reaction
            resulting in fibrosis, which occludes the fallopian tubes. They also contain a flexible
            stainless steel inner coil and a dynamic outer nickel titanium alloy coil that expands
            to help anchor the device while fibrosis is occurring [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Three months after the device is inserted, it is recommended that the patient undergoes
            a hysterosalpingogram to confirm that the fallopian tubes are blocked [

            </span>]. Until this confirmation is performed, the patient must use a back-up form of birth
            control.
         </p>
         <p>The reported complications associated with the device include heavy periods, irregular
            menses, dyspareunia, and spotting with ovulation [

         <p>Preoperative preparation for Essure placement includes discussing all alternatives
            to sterilization with the patient, efficacy of the procedure, and possible complications.
            Like laparoscopic sterilization, antibiotic prophylaxis and thromboprophylaxis are
            not necessary. In order for the procedure to be successful, a clear view of the tubal
            ostia is required. Also, the endometrium should be thin when the procedure is performed.
            This can be accomplished by pretreating the patient with a progestin-containing contraceptive.
            After pretreatment, the procedure can be performed at any time during the cycle except
            for during menstruation. In our case, there was difficulty visualizing the fallopian
            tube ostia on entry to the uterine cavity by hysteroscopy despite appropriate preparation
            of the endometrium with OCPs [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Our patient experienced chronic pelvic pain following Essure placement and chose to
            have the device removed while undergoing a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. She
            reported resolution of symptoms after the Essure device was removed. This potential
            side effect has been reported in the literature and can be due to misplacement of
            the device. It has also been noted to be more prevalent in patients who had a diagnosis
            of preexisting chronic pain such as chronic low back pain or fibromyalgia [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, up to fifty percent of pelvic pain that develops postoperatively will
            resolve on its own within three months.
         </p>
         <p>Placement of the Essure device is like any other surgical procedure and involves learning
            the proper technique of inserting the device. Hysteroscopy is used to visualize the
            tubal ostia but problems are sometimes encountered. There can be many factors limiting
            visibility such as equipment failure and uterine perforation. These issues can be
            minimized by good surgical technique and understanding of the hysteroscopic equipment.
            Currently a two percent failure rate is reported, but this is mainly due to factors
            such as tubal stenosis or occlusion, which make placement impossible [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Proper placement of the microinserts is essential in preventing the patient from
            developing pelvic pain.

         <title>4. Conclusion</title>
         <p>This report reinforces the need to consider a misplaced Essure device in the differential
            diagnosis of late-onset pelvic pain in women who had difficult placement of the device.
            In addition to demonstrating tubal occlusion, careful examination of the configuration
            of the Essure microinserts on HSG examination provides valuable information in patients
            with pelvic pain after Essure placement or cases where tubal perforation by the device
            is suspected. Our case reinforces besides an unusual location of a misplaced Essure
            device that late-onset pelvic pain should alert the physician to such complication.
         </p>
         <p>Furthermore, physicians should be cautious in performing hysteroscopic sterilization
            in patients with a history of chronic pain and should counsel patients that pelvic
            pain may develop after the procedure. Before surgical removal of Essure, it is important
            to thoroughly discuss the risk of continuing symptoms with patients. Physicians should
            help patients consider all of the potential options for sterilization, including laparoscopy,
            and help them decide what is best for them.
         </p>
         <p>Future prospective studies should focus on chronic pain as a risk factor for development
            of new pain after hysteroscopic sterilization.

               <p>Post-Essure hysterosalpingogram (HSG) (12/29/11): no spillage is noted on either side,
                  which confirms bilateral tubal occlusion, while showing the left Essure coil microinsert
                  twisted in an abnormal configuration (red circle), which does not seem to follow the
                  expected anatomic trajectory of the fallopian tube. Instead, it appears curved on
                  itself in an elliptical fashion.
