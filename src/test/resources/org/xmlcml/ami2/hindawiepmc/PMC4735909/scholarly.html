         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in children is a rare but disabling disease that accounts
            for almost half cases of stroke. We report our experience of ICH in children. Retrospective
            review of medical records of children (1 month-16 years) admitted in Pediatric Intensive
            Care Unit between January 2007 and December 2014 was done. Data collected included
            age, gender, presentation, examination findings, neuroimaging done (CT, MRI, and angiography)
            management (conservative/intervention), and outcome. Results are presented as frequency
            and percentages. Of the total 50 patients, 58% were male and 26% were &lt;1 year. On
            presentation 44% had vomiting, 42% had seizures, and GCS &lt; 8 while 40% had altered
            level of consciousness. Single bleed was present in 88%, 94% had supratentorial bleed,
            and 32% had intraventricular extension. 72% had bleed volume of &lt;30 mL and 8% had
            &gt;60 mL. CT scan was done in 98% patients and MRI in 34%, while 6% underwent conventional
            angiography. 60% patients were managed conservatively, 36% underwent neurosurgical
            intervention, and 6% underwent radiological vascular intervention. Hematologic causes
            were identified in 52% patients and vascular malformations in 14% and in 26% no cause
            could be identified. 26% of patients expired.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in children is a rare but often disabling disease,
            leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality in this population [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">

                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. It accounts for almost fifty percent of all the cases of stroke in children [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>

                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Various pediatric studies on ICH report different values depending on differences
            in the population studied and difference in the sensitivity and timing of diagnostic
            modalities used. Owing to the rarity of this entity and a potentially fatal course,
            it poses a diagnostic as well as therapeutic challenge to physicians in the current
            era [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>The most common causes of spontaneous ICH in children are found to be vascular malformations
            like arteriovenous malformations (AVM), aneurysms, and cavernous angioma [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. These account for almost 40% to 57% of cases of spontaneous ICH. Other causes include
            bleeding disorders: acquired and congenital. Hematological disorders are reported
            to be the major risk factor in 10% to 30% of the hemorrhagic strokes in most studies.
            Most cases of acquired coagulopathies result from aplastic anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic
            purpura (ITP), neoplasia, and thrombocytopenia of chronic kidney and liver disease.
            Congenital disorders include hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and rarer diseases like von
            Willebrand factors (vWF) deficiency and FXIII deficiency among others [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">

                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Despite the advent of newer coagulation assays and neuroimaging techniques, many
            cases of brain hemorrhage in children remain unexplained.
         </p>
         <p>Much remains to be known about its epidemiology from our part of the world as it is
            relatively less common disease and data is limited to mainly case series [

         <title>2. Methods</title>
         <p>A retrospective review of medical records of children (age of 1 month to 18 years),
            admitted between 2007 and 2014 in our PICU with spontaneous ICH, was performed. We
            selected this year duration because of more frequent use of CT and MRI during this
            era. Our PICU is a multidisciplinary-cardiothoracic closed ICU with average of 450
            annual admissions and 24-hour coverage by a senior resident and is supervised by a
            trained (American Board Certified) pediatric intensivist. There are no dedicated pediatric
            neurosurgeons in our hospital. A dedicated radiological suit is present with round-the-clock
            service for all the diagnostic testing and procedure including CT scan, MRI, MRA,
            and interventional radiology.
         </p>
         <p>A total of 50 patients were identified. Data collected included demographics (age
            and sex), etiology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging investigations, and neurological
            examination at admission, anatomic location, surgical procedures, therapy, and immediate
            outcome (survival versus death) on a structured pro forma. The diagnosis was confirmed
            by CT, MRI, and different hematological investigations as required. Radiographic studies
            were reviewed with the radiologist whenever possible. The volume of intracerebral
            hematoma was calculated on CT scan images in all the patients except one (on MRI)
            according to ABC/XYZ volume estimation on the first imaging done [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Preterm infants born at less than 37 weeks' gestation and term infants with pure intraventricular
            hemorrhages were excluded. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee
            (ERC) of the institute (ERC number 3092-PED-ERC-14).
         </p>
         <p>Analysis was done using SPSS version 19. Results are presented as frequency and percentages
            and mean and standard deviation (SD). Chi square test was applied for possible risk
            factors associated with bad outcome and 
            <i>p</i> value of &lt;0.05 was considered significant.

         <title>3. Results</title>
         <p>Out of the 50 children admitted in our PICU with ICH, mean age of the patients was
            7.1 years (SD ± 5.6), 26% of children were &lt;1 years, and 29 (58%) children were males.
            The presenting symptoms included vomiting in 44% and seizures in 42%, followed by
            loss of consciousness in 40% and headache in 28%. Focal deficits were seen in 8% of
            cases. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of &lt;8 was present in 42%. Mean PRISM III score on
            presentation was 7.3 SD ± 6.3 (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
            </span>).
         </p>
         <p>Seven cases (14%) were due to vascular malformation, 6 cases were due to AVM, and
            one case was due to an aneurysm. Laboratory examinations detected 4 cases of acute
            leukemia, 6 cases of aplastic anemia, 3 cases of ITP, 7 cases of vitamin K deficiency
            bleeding, and a single case of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Factor
            VIII and factor XIII deficiency were identified in 3 and 2 patients, respectively.
            One patient developed ICH after pseudomonas meningitis, and one each after acute liver
            failure, viral encephalitis and thalassemia. Etiology remained undetermined in 13
            patients (26%).
         </p>
         <p>CT was performed in 49/50 (98%) cases, and CT scan alone was done in 14 patients;
            course of two of these patients was too short to allow for further investigation while
            the rest of these patients had underlying hematological cause. CT angiography was
            performed in in 13% of patients, MRI was performed in in 33% of patients, and Magnetic
            Resonance Angiography (MRA) was performed in in 10% of patients while conventional
            angiography was performed in 3 patients. Single and supratentorial bleed was present
            in 44 (88%) and 47 (94%) patients, respectively. There were 49 (97%) patients intraparenchymal
            bleed, 6 (12%) patients with subarachnoid bleed, and 2 patients with subdural bleed.
            Eight cases (16%) had multiple episodes of ICH. Three patients with multiple episodes
            of ICH were suffering from acute leukemia while one child had developed DIC.
         </p>
         <p>The intraparenchymal bleed was further subdivided into supratentorial and infratentorial.
            Of the supratentorial bleed, 4 patients had intraventricular hemorrhage, 39 (76.5%)
            were lobar, and 6 (11.8%) primarily involved the basal ganglia and thalamus. Of the
            lobar cases, 21 cases were predominantly frontal, 4 cases were parietal, and 14 cases
            were temporal in location. Intraventricular extension was seen in 11 cases of cerebral
            hemorrhages.
         </p>
         <p>Only 4 (8%) patients had volume of bleed &gt;60 mL and two of them died while 10 (20%)
            had 30–60 mL and 37 (74%) had &lt;30 mL. Conservative management was done in 30 (60%)
            patients, while 18 (36%) patients underwent neurosurgical procedure that included
            evacuation of hematoma, decompressive craniotomy, or clipping of aneurysms. Three
            patients underwent vascular interventional radiology procedure.
         </p>
         <p>The mean length of hospital stay was 8.9 days (SD ± 7.8), with a range from 0 (i.e.,
            patients who survived &lt;1 day) to 39 days.
         </p>
         <p>The in-hospital survival rate of all patients was 74% as 13 patients expired (26%)
            with 9 patients fulfilling the criteria for brain death. Patients with GCS &lt; 8 had
            higher mortality rates (
            <i>p</i> value 0.017, OR 3.21, and 95% CI 1.13–9.07) (

         <p>The age and gender distribution of our patients are similar to other reports (mean
            age of 7 years and M : F (1.3 : 1)) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">

            </span>]. The presentation of ICH in our series was with vomiting (44%), seizures (42%),
            and altered consciousness (40%) and only 8% had focal neurological signs. Kumar et
            al. case series showed symptoms of increased intracerebral pressures (70%) and altered
            consciousness (50%) as the main presentation in their patients and less patients had
            seizures (28%) and weakness (36%) [

               </sup>
            </span>]. This may be due to age differences as younger children are not able to communicate
            headache. Almost the same results are shown by Al-Jarallah et al. [

         </p>
         <p>A recent population based study reported a distribution of risk factors that was similar
            to many previous reports in that most cases of ICH were caused by structural vascular
            lesions like AVMs [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Our study showed that AVMs were the second most frequent cause for ICH (7/50 13.7%).
         </p>
         <p>As a result of better management of the rare chronic etiologies of ICH (brain tumor
            and congenital heart disease) in children over the past decades, the etiology of ICH
            in children has transitioned to these chronic diseases. Hematological disorders such
            as aplastic anemia (5/50 10%), ITP (3/50), and acute leukemia (4/50 8%) are the most
            frequent group of disorders leading to ICH in our study group. Similarly, Al-Jarallah
            et al. also reported bleeding disorders in 32% of their patients [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Congenital disorders such as FVIII deficiency (3/50) and FXIII deficiency (2/50)
            also led to ICH in children in our series. This high incidence of ICH secondary to
            bleeding disorders in our study can be explained by high number of children treated
            for hematological disorders at our institute.
         </p>
         <p>Our study reported a substantial number of ICH (7/50 13.7%) due to vitamin K deficiency
            bleeding (VKDB) which generally occurs in young infants [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Although administration of intramuscular vitamin K in the postnatal period has
            dramatically reduced the incidence VKDB, rare sporadic cases with late onset hemorrhage
            have been described in exclusively breast-fed children despite this [

            </span>]. Other causes include malabsorption and hepatobiliary disease. But in our case series
            it could be due to high number of home-deliveries in Pakistan, where IM vitamin K
            is not administered to the neonate.
         </p>
         <p>Like of Al-Jarallah et al., the main location of hemorrhage was supratentorial [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">

         <p>Management strategies primarily focus on prevention of rebleeding, minimizing neurological
            deficits, and decreasing the risk of hematoma expansion and cerebral ischemia. Management
            options include supportive management in the PICU with neuroprotective strategies
            and surgical procedures for evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma in selected cases.

         <p>Different risk factors like volume, size, and location of hemorrhage have been described
            to be associated with bad outcome. Comatose state (GCS &lt; 8), infratentorial bleeds,
            and age younger than 3 years are poor prognostic factors as determined by previous
            studies. Although our series confirms the morbidity and mortality depending on GCS,
            we were not able to find the significant association with other risks already identified.

         <p>In contrast to the mortality seen in children with primary lesions like AVMs (40–42%)
            in the literature, our study reports no deaths in patients with AVMs.

            advanced investigation and therapeutic modalities are still scarce.

         <title>5. Conclusion </title>
         <p>ICH still remains a disabling disease with no underlying identifiable cause in many
            cases. A high index of suspicion is of paramount importance in early recognition and
            management of children with this problem. Long-term morbidity and mortality are considerable,
            especially in the cases of infratentorial hemorrhage and in children with hematological
            disorders.
