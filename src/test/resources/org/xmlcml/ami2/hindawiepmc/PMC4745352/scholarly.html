         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Purpose</i>. Previous research has indicated the public health impact of inadequate sleep duration
            on health, potentially through an immune-inflammation mechanism. This mechanism also
            has a role in periodontitis. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is
            an association of routine inadequate sleep and periodontitis.
            <i> Methods</i>. Data from merged National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey years 2009-10
            and 2011-12 were the data source for the study. The key outcome was periodontitis
            (yes, no), and the key variable of interest was usual sleep on weekday or workday
            nights. Chi square and logistic regression procedures were conducted. The study included
            3,740 participants who were of ages 30 years and above.
            <i> Results</i>. There were 52.7% of participants who had periodontitis. There were 35.7% who usually
            slept less than 7 hours on weekday or workday nights. In adjusted logistic regression
            the odds ratio for periodontal disease for participants who slept less than 7 hours
            on weekday or workday night was 1.00 [95% confidence interval: 0.83, 1.21; 
            <i>p</i> = .9812].
            <i> Conclusions</i>. The relationship of periodontitis and inadequate sleep duration in a nationally
            representative study of participants who were of ages 30 years and above failed to
            reach statistical significance in adjusted logistic regression analyses.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Periodontitis involves inflammation of gingival tissue, clinical attachment loss of
            the periodontal ligament, and loss of alveolar bone support. Periodontitis is a public
            health concern since it is a major factor in tooth loss [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] and has associations with many systemic diseases which also involve inflammation.
            In periodontitis, the host response to microbial pathogens leads to inflammation.
            The inflammation has been shown to result from (1) plaque and local factors overwhelming
            the host responses; (2) an inadequate host response in individuals with limited plaque
            and local factors but are compromised/susceptible individuals [

            </span>]. An appropriate host response is required for defense of the tissue; the host defense
            must not be inadequate or overwhelming [

            means by which to limit periodontal tissue destruction.

         <p>It is known that sleep is important to health and well-being. Inadequate sleep has
            effects on learning, memory processing, the repair of cell damage, brain development,
            neurobehavioral performance, hormonal regulation, risk of depression, increased cortisol,
            and ghrelin, impaired glucose metabolism, and increased inflammatory and proinflammatory
            markers among many other influences [

                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. It is also known that there has been a worldwide decrease in the average number
            of hours that people sleep since the mid-1970s. Currently, the average number of hours
            that a person sleeps is less than seven hours a night [

            </span>]. Both adults and children are sleeping fewer hours than adults and children of the
            previous generation [

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Since inflammation is characteristic of both periodontitis and inadequate sleep, sleep
            may have a role in periodontal disease. The purpose of this study is to determine
            if there is an association of sleeping less than 7 hours a night and periodontitis
            in individuals of ages 30 years and above.

               using Hu Friedy PCP-2 (Hu Friedy, Chicago, IL) periodontal probes with markings of

               confounders that have not been considered in the adjusted analysis. Nevertheless,

               the periodontal examinations were performed by calibrated, licensed dentists and dental
