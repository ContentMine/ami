         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Objective</i>. Thyroid disease has been reported among the endocrinopathies that can occur after
            treatment with ipilimumab. Graves' disease, however, has been rarely reported with
            this medication. Here we report a case of Graves' disease diagnosed after initiation
            of ipilimumab in a patient with melanoma.
            <i> Methods</i>. We present the clinical presentation and management course of this patient followed
            by a related literature review.
            <i> Results</i>. A 67-year-old male with metastatic melanoma was started on ipilimumab. He developed
            hyperthyroidism after two doses of ipilimumab. The cause of hyperthyroidism was determined
            to be Graves' disease. Ipilimumab was held and the patient was started on methimazole
            with return to euthyroid status. Ipilimumab was resumed and the patient continued
            methimazole during the course of ipilimumab therapy, with controlled hyperthyroidism.
            Restaging studies following four cycles of ipilimumab showed complete response in
            the lungs, with residual melanoma in the neck. The patient then underwent total thyroidectomy
            and left neck dissection as a definitive treatment for both hyperthyroidism and residual
            melanoma.
            <i> Conclusion</i>. Graves' disease can develop after starting ipilimumab and methimazole can be an
            effective treatment. For patients whose hyperthyroidism is well-controlled on methimazole,
            ipilimumab may be resumed with close monitoring.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Ipilimumab is an FDA-approved human monoclonal antibody that blocks an immune checkpoint
            molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) leading to increased
            antitumor activity of tumor-specific T-cells and improved survival in patients with
            melanoma [

         <p>The patient is a 67-year-old male with metastatic melanoma involving cervical lymph
            nodes and lungs. He had normal thyroid function tests before initiation of ipilimumab
            and he has no previous history of thyroid disease. Ipilimumab was started at a dose
            of 3 mg/kg every three weeks. After receiving two of four planned cycles of therapy,
            he developed clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
            </span>). There was no thyroid tenderness on exam and no palpable thyroid nodules. There
            were also no signs of ophthalmopathy. Laboratories revealed an elevated thyroid stimulation
            immunoglobulin level and I-123 scan revealed diffuse homogeneous uptake that was elevated
            at 6 hours at 30.4% (normal is 5–15%) and at 24 hours at 47.4% (normal 10–33%), consistent
            with Graves' disease. Ipilimumab was held, and the patient was started on methimazole
            at a dose of 30 mg/day with titration to control the thyroid hormone levels (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
            </span>). The highest dose of methimazole used was a total of 35 mg a day. Restaging CT scans
            showed persistent cervical adenopathy, but resolution of his lung nodules consistent
            with an immune response to ipilimumab. Given the excellent early clinical response
            to ipilimumab and the desire to achieve the greatest presurgical response, it was
            recommended that he complete all 4 cycles of ipilimumab if his hyperthyroidism could
            be safely controlled. He subsequently received two additional cycles of ipilimumab
            on methimazole to complete the treatment plan for the melanoma. Methimazole was continued
            during this time and hyperthyroidism remained controlled (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="tab1">
               <a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>
            </span>). He subsequently underwent a left neck dissection for residual metastatic melanoma
            along with total thyroidectomy. Pathology (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>) revealed nodular and papillary hyperplasia of the thyroid, common findings in Graves'
            disease, along with an incidental papillary thyroid microcarcinoma. The patient was
            started on levothyroxine after surgery and his thyroid function tests normalized (

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Ipilimumab is an immune therapy that has been shown to increase survival in patients
            with melanoma [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Ipilimumab works by blocking CTLA-4, which is an immune checkpoint receptor expressed
            on the surface of helper T-cells. CTLA-4 normally functions to impair the costimulatory
            activation of T-cells by CD28, leading to downregulation of T-cell activity. By blocking
            CTLA-4, ipilimumab removes this negative regulation and induces immune responses that
            can lead to antitumor activity.
         </p>
         <p>Ipilimumab has been associated with the development of new autoimmune endocrinopathies,
            likely related directly to its mechanism of action. The most common endocrine side
            effect is hypophysitis with an incidence rate of 11% in one study [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B8">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] and 8% in another [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Ipilimumab can lead to autoimmune thyroid disease, with the most common manifestation
            being hypothyroidism in about 6% followed by thyroiditis characterized by hyperthyroid
            and hypothyroid phases [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Hyperthyroidism resulting from overproduction of thyroid hormone as seen in Graves's
            disease has been more rarely reported. One case of thyroid storm was reported by Yu
            et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B9">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] in a patient receiving ipilimumab, which occurred after two doses of ipilimumab
            and subsequently responded to antithyroid medication. Other studies reported eye disease
            typical of Graves's disease after using ipilimumab [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In one of these cases [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>], hyperthyroidism developed in addition to the eye disease. The diagnosis of Graves'
            disease was confirmed in our patient given his elevated thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin,
            which has very high specificity for diagnosis of Graves' disease [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">10</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This was also supported by elevated iodine uptake and a homogenous scan, which
            further confirmed Graves's disease [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B11">11</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Pathologically, the nodular hyperplasia noted at the time of resection was supportive
            of the diagnosis as well.
         </p>
         <p>It is difficult to characterize a typical time-course for the development of ipilimumab-related
            Graves' disease due to the small number of cases. McElnea et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] reported the case of ophthalmopathy in a patient who was euthyroid after two doses
            while Min et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] reported Graves' eye disease after four doses of ipilimumab. These are similar to
            the present case in which the disease developed after two doses of ipilimumab.
         </p>
         <p>The pathogenesis of Graves' disease is due to the development of activating antibodies
            directed against the TSH receptor, which results in hyperthyroidism. This antibody
            formation involves activation of T2 helper cells. Therefore it is plausible to hypothesize
            that blocking CTLA-4 results in the development of activating antibodies against the
            TSH receptor thereby causing Graves' disease in susceptible individuals.
         </p>
         <p>There are several points that support this relation between CTLA-4 and Graves' disease.
            Heward et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] showed allelic association between the G allele of the CTLA-4 gene and Graves' disease.
            Furthermore in the same study [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B12">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] there was a relationship between allelic variation of the CTLA-4 gene and circulating
            free T4 concentration at the time of diagnosis suggesting a link between the gene
            and the severity of Graves' disease. Daroszewski et al. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">13</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] showed that serum levels of a transcript of CTLA-4 were increased in patients with
            Graves' disease.
         </p>
         <p>Management of patients with Graves's disease in patients being treated with ipilimumab
            is not well described. It is recommended that ipilimumab be stopped for any endocrinopathy
            that is not controlled [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B14">14</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In our case, ipilimumab was initially held and hyperthyroidism was controlled with
            methimazole. Then ipilimumab was restarted with successful control of thyroid hormone
            levels throughout the remainder of the treatment course with methimazole. The choice
            to perform surgery in this patient was influenced by the fact that radical neck surgery
            was already indicated for treatment of his melanoma. Other treatment options such
            as radioactive iodine treatment or continuation of methimazole were also valid choices
            for our patient. It is also possible that Graves' disease would remit over time after
            completion of the ipilimumab therapy. Following TSH receptor antibodies to undetectable
            levels after taking methimazole can help in predicting Graves' disease remission [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B11">11</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>It has not yet been determined whether it is possible to predict the development of
            Graves' disease after starting ipilimumab. Measuring thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins
            may be helpful; however these may not be elevated unless the patient develops hyperthyroidism.
            Given the challenge in predicting Graves' disease, it is important to monitor all
            patients receiving this medication by measuring thyroid function regularly.
         </p>
         <p>In summary Graves's disease can develop after starting ipilimumab. Managing these
            patients can be challenging, especially if further doses of ipilimumab are recommended,
            and this management has not been well described in the literature. As in our case,
            methimazole appears to be efficacious in this treatment, as it would be in the more
            commonplace cases of Graves's disease developing without the use of ipilimumab.
