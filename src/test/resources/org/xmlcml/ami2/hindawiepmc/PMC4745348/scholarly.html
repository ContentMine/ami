         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>A 31-year-old Hispanic male with no medical history was admitted for fevers, pleurisy,
            and cough after recent oral surgery and completing demolition and construction work
            in Juarez, Mexico. Imaging showed a 4.4 cm cavitary lesion and bilateral tree-in-bud
            opacities. Initial suspicion of bacterial infection confirmed with clinical improvement
            on culture specific antibiotics, but after discharge he returned with progression
            of symptoms and new dyspnea. Radiograph showed a pyopneumothorax. Chest computed tomography
            after thoracostomy showed worsening infiltrates and another cavitary lesion. Symptoms
            persisted despite addition of broad spectrum antibiotics. Surgical repair for persistent
            air leak was required. Weeks after discharge, cultures and serologies returned positive
            for
            <i> Coccidioidomycosis immitis</i>.
            <i> Coccidioides</i> species cause up to 30% of community-acquired pneumonia and incidental cavitary lesions
            in endemic regions. Symptoms are nonspecific yet usually involve fatigue, cough, and
            pleurisy. Most hosts have spontaneous resolution; however, certain demographics such
            as Hispanics and diabetics, later diagnosed in our patient, have higher morbidity.
            As seen with our patient, cavitary rupture and bronchopleural fistulas are rare occurring
            in 2.6% of cavitary lesions. High suspicion based on symptoms and host demographics
            is important to assist in early diagnosis and treatment to avoid and treat this common
            pathogen's presentations.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Coccidioidomycosis is prevalent in the southwestern United States. However due to
            migration and travel, cases have been reported across the world and with increasing
            frequency. Data from the Centers for Disease Control demonstrate an increased incidence
            from 5.3 per 100,000 population in 1998 to 42.6 per 100,000 population in 2011 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This approximates a 16% annual increased incidence. In endemic regions,
            <i> Coccidioides</i> species are responsible for 15–30% of community-acquired pneumonia [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This dimorphic fungus is found in soil; thus cases in endemic regions spike after
            rainy seasons (i.e., spring, end of summer) and natural or man-related activities
            that disturb the environment (i.e., dust storms, earthquakes, excavations, and construction).
            <i> Coccidioides</i> infection, also known as Valley Fever, was first described after multiple cases of
            patients became infected from
            <i> Coccidioides immitus</i> in the San Joaquin Valley area in California; however it is endemic throughout the
            desert southwest United States. A second species,
            <i> Coccidioidomycosis posadasii</i>, is genetically different but presents similarly and in the same endemic regions.
            As more cases appear, it is important for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion
            and understand full spectrum of disease and rare complications that can occur.

         <title>2. Case Presentation</title>
         <p>A 31-year-old previously healthy male presented for two weeks of fevers, productive
            cough, and pleurisy. Symptom onset followed recent wisdom tooth extraction and travel
            to Juarez, Mexico, for construction work. He is a resident of El Paso, Texas. On admission
            he was febrile, and chest auscultation revealed left basilar crackles.
         </p>
         <p>His laboratory findings revealed a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/
            <i>μ</i>L, and chest radiography demonstrated a 4.4 cm cavitary lesion (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>). Further evaluation via chest CT revealed an air fluid level (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>), left hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and bilateral tree-in-bud and nodular
            opacities. Bronchoscopic evaluation did not reveal bronchial abnormalities, but cultures
            from lavage grew
            <i> Haemophilus influenza</i> and Group F
            <i> Streptococcus</i>. He was diagnosed with a necrotizing pneumonia and discharged with amoxicillin clavulanate
            after resolution of his fever and leukocytosis.
         </p>
         <p>Five days later he returned with recurrent fevers and dry cough. He complained of
            new acute dyspnea and worsening of pleurisy after a coughing fit. He denied arthralgias.
            He was febrile up to 103.0°F with otherwise stable vitals. Pulmonary exam was significant
            for absent breath sounds on the left, splinting, and midline trachea. There were no
            meningeal signs or skin lesions. His white blood cell count was 17.5 K/
            <i>μ</i>L. Chest radiograph on this admission showed left sided pyopneumothorax (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</span>).
         </p>
         <p>Our patient was readmitted and a chest tube placed. Repeat chest CT demonstrated worsening
            of disease via extension of pulmonary opacities and lymphadenopathy. Repeat respiratory
            cultures grew
            <i> Enterococcus cloacae</i>, but he did not respond to broad spectrum antibiotics and had persistent fever and
            leukocytosis. Multiple acid fast bacilli stains and cultures remained negative. Direct
            fluorescent assay for
            <i> Pneumocystis jirovecii</i>,
            <i> Cryptococcus</i> antigen, and galactomannan antigen for
            <i> Aspergillus</i> were negative.
         </p>
         <p>Serology sent during his first hospitalization due to high suspicion returned ID-TP
            and ID-CF positive for
            <i> Coccidioidomycosis immitis</i> with titers 1 : 16 and 1 : 8, respectively. He was started on fluconazole but underwent
            superior segmentectomy due to persistent air leak. Interestingly segmented tissue
            did not stain positively for any organism, and over a month later, lavage and intraoperative
            pleural fluid cultures grew
            <i> Coccidioidomycosis immitis</i>. The patient demonstrated continued improvement and was treated with an extended
            course of fluconazole followed by local specialists.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div tagxxx="sec">
         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Our patient presented multiple confounders to his eventual diagnosis. Despite living
            and working in an endemic area, his history of oral surgery and response to antibiotics
            were red herrings to the culprit,
            <i> Coccidioidomycosis immitis</i>. Additionally, the dramatic nature of his disease prompted screening for dissemination,
            HIV, and quantitative immunodeficiencies. All were negative. During his hospital course,
            the patient was diagnosed with diabetes, and that coupled with his reported ethnicity
            of being Hispanic and geographical and environmental risk factors made coccidioidomycosis
            high on the differential. However as described below with the rarity of ruptured coccidioidomycosis
            pulmonary cavities and delay in diagnosis through serum and direct culture analysis,
            treatment can often be delayed.
         </p>
         <p>Many patients with coccidioidal pneumonia are minimally troubled and do not seek medical
            treatment. Approximately 60% of infected patients will have nonspecific respiratory
            symptoms and significant fatigue one to three weeks after exposure [

                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Coccidioidomycosis can also manifest as nodules and cavitary disease. Asymptomatic
            pulmonary cavities are monitored [

               </sup>
            </span>]. Seen in 10–15% of patients with coccidioidomycosis, half of these cases demonstrate
            radiographic resolution without treatment [

            </span>]. The disease is considered noncontagious as inhaled arthroconidia, only 3–6 
            <i>μ</i>m in diameter, maneuver down terminal bronchioles and settle in alveoli [

            </span>]. There they proliferate into endospores and spherules, which are 20–60 
            <i>μ</i>m in diameter and too large to be brought up by expectoration [

            </span>]. Because of the periphery of the infection, pleuritic chest pain is often associated
            [

            </span>] as seen with our patient. Other symptoms include fatigue, arthralgias, erythema
            nodosum, and erythema multiforme, and more symptomatic patients go on to seek medical
            care. Disseminated coccidioidal mycosis is seen in less than five percent of cases
            and is typically seen in immunosuppressed groups, such as patients receiving high
            dose steroids or immunomodulators; patients with human immunodeficiency (HIV) infections;
            or patients with transplanted organs.
         </p>
         <p>Other than immunosuppressed populations, there are other populations at increased
            risk for significant and symptomatic pulmonary disease. Patients with diabetes have
            a relative risk of 2.94 for development of cavitary disease compared to their nondiabetic
            counterparts [

         <p>These populations, specifically diabetics, may be at more risk due to their immunocompromised
            state compared to the general healthy population.
            <i> Coccidioidomycosis immitis</i> arthroconidia are phagocytized and induce a humoral immune response. S cell walls
            are hydrophobic and are hypothesized to release a protease that renders humoral mediated
            immune response negligible [

            <i>γ</i>.
         </p>
         <p>Despite known risk factors for severe disease, because of rarity of ruptured cavitary
            disease it is difficult to characterize risk factors for this population. Pleural

         <p>Diagnosis requires understanding the manifestations of coccidioidomycosis and high
            suspicion especially in nonendemic regions. Although formation of antibodies may not
            be protective, the presence of serology can be used for diagnosis, and titers can
            prognosticate aggression of disease. Immunodiffusion to tube precipitin (ID-TP) is
            measurable within one to three weeks of onset, and immunodiffusion to complement fixating
            antigen (ID-CF) is measurable two to three weeks after inoculation and can be quantified.
            Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to CF titers more than 1 : 16 suggest severe disease [

            <i> Coccidioides</i> species are cultured best from pleural biopsy with rare positivity on sputum and

            sequencing, which can take many weeks. Additionally, cultures must be handled carefully
            by certain laboratories given high risk for inhalation by laboratory workers of arthroconidia.

         <p>Treatment is recommended in symptomatic patients, patients with multiple comorbidities,
            high risk factors, or dissemination. Fluconazole is the azole of choice for most pneumonia
            and cavitary disease except for the pregnant patient, for whom amphotericin B is necessary

            </span>]. Rare ruptured pulmonary cavities are treated surgically with lobectomy and decortication
            (AII recommendation). Despite these recommendations, there have been no randomized
            controlled trials showing if early treatment of uncomplicated pneumonia prevents morbidity
            or hastens recovery. Because of high suspicion and multiple risk factors for disseminated
            and presentation with complicated disease, our patient was started on fluconazole
            therapy while pending serum and culture confirmation. Perhaps increased awareness
            and economic impact analyses will prompt such research to help answer these questions.
