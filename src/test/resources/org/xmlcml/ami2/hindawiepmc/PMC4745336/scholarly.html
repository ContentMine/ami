         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>
            <i>Introduction</i>. Proper implementation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services
            requires adequate knowledge and appropriate attitudes and practices on the part of
            the health care providers especially in rural areas where access to health care delivery
            is very limited in Oyo State.
            <i> Materials and Methods</i>. This is a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 350 health care workers in a two-stage
            sampling technique. Data was obtained using interviewer-administered, pretested, semistructured
            questionnaires. The data was analyzed using Epi Info software version 7.
            <i> Results</i>. The knowledge of PMTCT of HIV was poor among the health care workers (69.1%). However,
            more than half (58.3%) had good attitudes towards PMTCT of HIV/AIDS. Predictors of
            good knowledge of PMTCT were religion [AOR = 1.6, 95% CI (1.1–2.6)], cadre of occupation
            [AOR = 10.2, 95% CI (2.9–35.1)], and length of service [AOR = 4.3, 95% CI (2.3–19.4)].
            Predictors of good attitude towards PMTCT were length of service in the current hospital
            [AOR = 2.8, 95% CI (1.5–5.2)] and cadre of occupation [AOR = 3.9, 95% CI (1.28–11.9)].
            <i> Conclusion</i>. Despite poor knowledge of PMTCT of HIV/AIDS among the health care workers, the attitude
            towards PMTCT of HIV/AIDS was good. There is need for the involvement of the stakeholders
            in bridging the gap between knowledge of and attitude towards prevention of MTCT of
            HIV/AIDS among health care workers in the rural areas.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Globally, about forty million people are currently living with HIV [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This is about one percent of the world population. In 2006, there were about 4.3
            million new HIV infections worldwide. Of the total number of AIDS patients globally
            48 percent is women with 59 percent in sub-Saharan Africa [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">

                  <a href="#B2">2</a>

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>It is estimated that more than 60% of Nigerian population lives in rural areas, most
            of whom are underserved in terms of social amenities [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Also, facilities that provide services are concentrated in urban areas particularly
            in secondary and tertiary health facilities. Universal coverage of highly active ARV
            treatment (HAART) for HIV-positive pregnant women in Oyo State which is 38% is far
            below the target of 80% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>There is a limited comprehensive intervention package available to postpartum mothers
            in most health facilities in Oyo State. Interventions on PMTCT were offered in some
            facilities in Oyo State through the AIDS Prevention Initiative in Nigeria (APIN) project
            funded by President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Child survival is compromised
            due to limited access to prevention services, in Oyo State.
         </p>
         <p>Prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been considered as not a simple intervention
            but a comprehensive set of interventions requiring capable health workers. It starts
            with testing pregnant women for HIV, preferably during their first antenatal visit.
            When giving the test result, health care workers should provide good counselling,
            including information about PMTCT options.
         </p>
         <p>The health system should ensure that HIV-positive women receive the PMTCT services
            that they choose and should provide postnatal care. All along the timeline from finding
            out their serostatus to getting treatment for HIV-related problems, women and their
            children should be followed up closely. The need for comprehensive and long-term care
            for HIV-infected women has become a challenge for health systems, particularly where
            lack of coordination among different facilities is common [

         <p>We assessed perceptions of health care workers in rural areas of PMTCT services in
            Oyo State. The findings of this study should inform the development of a more effective
            program for the fourth prong of the WHO-recommended comprehensive PMTCT program.

         <title>2. Methods</title>
         <p>This study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of health care workers in rural
            PMTCT clinics in Oyo State, southwestern Nigeria. The study was carried out in October
            2013. There are three senatorial districts with 120 PMTCT clinics in Oyo State, of
            which 50 were in rural areas of the state. Selection of respondents was based on their
            function, position, and experience in the implementation of PMTCT services. Interviewees
            were first screened to check that they had appropriate positions and at least one
            year of experience with PMTCT, so that they could provide insightful information.
            They included doctors, nurses, midwives, community health extension workers, and health
            assistants. Three hundred and fifty respondents were recruited to the study using
            a two-stage sampling technique.
         </p>
         <p>Stage 1: The list of all the PMTCT clinics in the rural areas in each senatorial zone
            was obtained. Simple random sampling was used to select 10 clinics out of the 50 clinics
            in the rural areas of the state using proportional allocation. Simple random sampling
            was used to select 5 clinics from Oyo South senatorial zone, 2 clinics from Oyo Central
            zone, and 3 clinics from Oyo North senatorial zone.
         </p>
         <p>Stage 2: A list of health workers in each PMTCT clinic that was sampled was obtained.
            Respondents were selected using systematic sampling: the first respondent was randomly
            selected and every 5th person was chosen as the next respondent until the desired
            sample size per facility was obtained.
         </p>
         <p>Data was collected with pretested, semistructured interviewer-administered questionnaire.
            The questionnaire obtained information on the sociodemographic data of the respondents
            and knowledge and attitude towards the prevention of MTCT of HIV/AIDS. Data was entered
            into a computer and analyzed using the Epi Info software version 7 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">

                  <a href="#B8">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Composite knowledge and attitude scores were computed for PMTCT-related knowledge
            and attitude by scoring 1 for each correct answer and 0 for an incorrect answer. These
            scores were then summed up and divided by the total number of test items to arrive
            at an average knowledge and attitude score per person. Association between sociodemographic
            characteristics and knowledge of PMTCT of HIV/AIDS was examined using the odds ratio
            with level of significance set at 5%. Ethical approval was obtained from Oyo State
            Ministry of Health Ethical Review Committee and written informed consent was obtained
            from all interviewees, who were invited to participate voluntarily. The interviews
            were conducted privately and anonymously. There were no refusals.

         <p>Health care workers had poor knowledge about PMTCT of HIV/AIDS. Though the knowledge
            about PMTCT was poor among the respondents, the majority have a good attitude towards
            PMTCT. This is in contrast to a study done in Botswana, where having a high PMTCT
            knowledge score was a major factor associated with good attitude towards PMTCT. Also
            a study carried out in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, reported that 89.3% of general medical
            practitioners agreed that their knowledge of, attitude towards, and practice of PMTCT
            of HIV/AIDS were deficient [

                  <a href="#B9">8</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. In a study conducted on 53 health care workers in Vietnam identified inadequate
            knowledge and skills regarding PMTCT among health care workers were one of the factors
            affecting the delivery of PMTCT services [

         </p>
         <p>Religion is associated with good knowledge of prevention of MTCT of HIV/AIDS. Being
            Christian has significant association with good knowledge about PMTCT. This finding
            is also in line with a study from Osogbo, Nigeria, where religion was associated with
            knowledge of PMTCT of HIV/AIDS [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. Also a study from Ghana revealed that Christians had good knowledge of PMTCT compared
            to the Muslims [

            </span>]. This finding may be due to the fact that religious leaders are getting involved
            in campaigns against HIV infection. Studies have showed that religious organizations
            are recognized for playing an important role in preventing new infections in Uganda
            [

            </span>]. Nearly all of its major religious institutions, both Islamic and Christian, have
            been actively engaged in the country's struggle with HIV/AIDS [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B13">12</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Many nongovernmental organizations do plenty of collaborative work with religious
            organizations in Nigeria, all in a bid to increase awareness of MTCT and its prevention.
            Unfortunately however, many faith-based organizations see immoral behavior as being
            the cause of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and they therefore decline involvement in preventive
            and intervention programs [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">
               <sup>

            </span>].
         </p>
         <p>Doctors and nurses were found to have good knowledge of PMTCT of HIV/AIDS. This is
            in line with findings of Nneka et al. (2007) where they reported doctors and nurses
            were more knowledgeable than paramedics [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B15">14</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. A study from Vietnam revealed that oftentimes training was provided to doctors
            on HIV/AIDS and PMTCT [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B10">9</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. This finding may be due to the training doctors and nurses underwent which gives
            background information on HIV/AIDS better than other cadres of health care workers.
            It may also be as a result of previous contact and management of HIV-positive pregnant
            women by doctor and nurses.
         </p>
         <p>Length of services was also associated with good knowledge and attitude towards PMTCT
            of HIV/AIDS. It was found that health care workers who had spent five years and above
            were more knowledgeable about prevention of MTCT. This may be due to repetitive exposure
            to HIV patients by health care workers thereby acquiring more knowledge through on-job
            training. There is possibility that HIV training can significantly improve such knowledge
            regarding HIV transmission and prevention. However, training alone may not have provided
            adequate information in these areas, since knowledge scores for some items were low
            for all workers. These results suggest that all health care workers may benefit from
            increased HIV/AIDS education in the context of PMTCT that recognizes existing gaps
            and prevent infection.
         </p>
         <p>Therefore, thorough training of health personnel in all aspects of mother-to-child
            transmission, feeding recommendations and options, and further preventive measures
            is indispensable.
         </p>
         <p>The finding from this present study revealed that community health officers/extension
            workers had good attitude towards prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS.
            A study from Maiduguri, Nigeria, revealed that nurses had poorer attitude towards
            PMTCT than doctors and other paramedical staff [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>]. This could be due to the fact that the majority of the health care workers in the
            rural areas were community health officers/extension workers and were already used
            to delivering PMTCT services. Studies have shown that less specialized cadres of health
            care workers are capable of effective delivery of HIV care with comparable and even
            better outcomes as physicians [

         <title>5. Conclusion and Recommendations</title>
         <p>Knowledge and attitudes on PMTCT amongst health care workers show that there was poor
            knowledge although the attitude was acceptable. Without further training and increase
            in staffing levels, the quality and access to PMTCT services will likely be negatively
            impacted. A wide gap exists between the knowledge of and attitude towards PMTCT of
            HIV/AIDS.
         </p>
         <p>Health promotional activities and behavioral change through effective communication
            routes such as refreshers course, trainings, and workshops should be promoted. This
            would take targeted health education messages beyond impacting knowledge. More elaborate
            studies should be carried out in this field in other parts of Nigeria in order to
            ensure improvement in knowledge and behavior.
