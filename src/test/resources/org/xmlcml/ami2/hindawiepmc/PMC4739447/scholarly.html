         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Retroperitoneal haematoma is a rare clinical entity with variable etiology. It can
            happen spontaneously, without any obvious precipitating factors, the so-called spontaneous
            retroperitoneal haematoma. There is no general consensus as to the best management
            plan for patients with retroperitoneal haematoma. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a
            rare cause of retroperitoneal haematoma. Here we report relationship between PAN and
            retroperitoneal haematoma and treatment approaches. However, an accepted and clearly
            defined treatment has not been established due to its rarity.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>PAN is a systemic, necrotizing vasculitis affecting medium-sized and small arteries.
            It is characterized by segmental necrosis leading to aneurysm formation. Kidney involvement
            in PAN is seen in 70–80% of the patients and it may rarely be complicated by aneurismal
            rupture leading to subcapsular and perirenal haematomas [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B1">1</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Perirenal haematoma as the presenting feature of PAN can be diagnostically challenging,
            leading to a delay in recognition and treatment. We report a case of spontaneous perirenal
            haematoma in a young patient who had nonspecific abdominal pain. The patient received
            conservative treatment without surgical intervention and had an uneventful recovery.

         <title>2. Case Report</title>
         <p>A 24-year-old man was referred to emergency service because of nontraumatic excruciating
            abdominal pain. Assessment of patient's history revealed that there have been intermittent
            abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, 10 kg weight loss, weakness, myalgia, and
            arthralgia of small joints in the last few months. He had no history of bleeding diathesis,
            or anticoagulant therapy. On physical examination, the patient appeared uncomfortable.
            His temperature was 37.4°C, his pulse was regular at 80 beats per minute, and his
            blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. He had left costovertebral angle tenderness. There
            were no rushes and skin lesions, the testes were nontender, and genital system looked
            normal. The results of laboratory examinations revealed leukocytosis of 23,9 (4,6–10,2),
            anemia with hemoglobin level of 9,6 (12,2–18,1), and elevated sedimentation rate of
            70 (0–15). Renal function tests and other biochemical parameters were unremarkable.
            The urinalysis showed proteinuria (+++) and haematuria (+++). Hepatitis B surface
            antigen, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative.
            A contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen showed multiple small wedge-shaped
            less-enhanced areas (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</span>) with suspicion of intrarenal hemorrhage, hemorrhagic cyst rupture, or right perirenal
            haematoma. The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics after blood and urine
            cultures were obtained. His hemoglobin initially decreased to 6.5 g/dL and then stabilized
            at 10.0 g/dL after transfusion of 7 units of packed red blood cells. His blood pressure
            levels elevated about 160/100 mmHg on follow-up and stabilized using ACE inhibitor.
            When the patient became hemodynamically stable, a selective renal arteriogram was
            performed (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</span>) which demonstrated multiple small aneurysms in the segmental and interlobar arteries
            of both kidneys but extravasation was not noted. Based on the clinical picture and
            multiple aneurysms on arteriogram, a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa was made in
            accordance with the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria by rheumatologist.
            The patient underwent right ureteral stent placement due to the renal colic and hydronephrosis.
            He was given intravenous methyl prednisolone 60 mg/day and intravenous pulse methyl
            prednisolone (1 day) followed by intravenous cyclophosphamide. After five pulses of
            intravenous cyclophosphamide, it was shifted to azathioprine along with low-dose steroids.
            He remained asymptomatic with no recurrence of symptoms at 6 months of follow-up and
            his blood pressure was normal with amlodipine and ramipril.

         <title>3. Discussion</title>
         <p>Spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage also known as Wunderlich syndrome (WS) is a
            rare but potentially life threatening entity characterized by acute onset of nontraumatic
            subcapsular and perirenal haematomas. Spontaneous perirenal bleeding secondary to
            PAN was first described by Schmidt in 1908. It is classically characterized by Lenk's
            triad: acute flank pain, abdominal tenderness, and signs of internal bleeding. A wide
            spectrum of neoplastic and nonneoplastic renal pathologies may result in WS. Zhang
            et al. reported on 135 such cases in their meta-analysis. Benign and malignant neoplasms
            accounted for the majority of cases (61%), with the most common being angiomyolipoma
            and renal cell carcinoma. Vascular causes were the next major cause with PAN accounting
            for 28 cases (17%) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B2">2</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Other causes of WS include arteriovenous malformations, venous thrombosis, cystic
            renal diseases, renal calculi, nephritis, and coagulation disorders. PAN is a necrotizing
            systemic inflammatory vasculitis with a peak incidence between the age of 40 and 60
            years. It most commonly affects the kidneys and skin. Aneurysms can develop due to
            segmental necrosis, which correlate with the severity of the illness and may cause
            the development of thrombosis, rupture, and hemorrhage [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B3">3</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Spontaneous renal hemorrhage or rupture is a rare complication. The prognosis for
            patients with untreated PAN is merciless with a 1-year survival rate of 50%; death
            is often a consequence of renal failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B4">4</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. With appropriate therapy generally based on prednisone and cyclophosphamide, the
            5-year survival rate is approximately 80% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. Given the poor prognosis associated with untreated PAN and the substantial improvement
            with appropriate treatment, it should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis
            in order to minimize morbidity and the risk of death. A ruptured aneurysm resulting
            in a huge perirenal haematoma usually necessitates an urgent surgery.
         </p>
         <p>Sometimes urgent nephrectomy is life-saving [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B6">6</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. But selected cases can be treated conservatively as in our case. Also therapeutic
            arterial embolization is becoming an alternative to surgery in patients with hemorrhage
            from ruptured aneurysm, especially those in critical condition [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#B7">7</a>
               </sup>
            </span>]. However, in this case, our patient required neither embolization nor nephrectomy.
            In our patient, an acute drop in hemoglobin levels occurred after a hypertensive attack.
            So hypertension should be treated aggressively. In conclusion, although we acknowledge
            that treatment options should be individualized and where necessary surgery should
            be performed to save the patient life, we still recommend careful diagnosis and observation
            to enable a case of retroperitoneal hemorrhage that spontaneously ceases to bleed
            to be managed conservatively. In this case report, we show conservative treatment
            of retroperitoneal haematoma because PAN is a viable option in addition to invasive
            procedures.
