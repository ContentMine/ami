         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Fenretinide is a chemotherapeutic agent in clinical trials for the treatment of neuroblastoma,
            among the most common and most deadly cancers of childhood. Fenretinide induces apoptosis
            in neuroblastoma cells through accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
            released from Complex II. The neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, potentiates this effect.
            The signaling activity of p75NTR is dependent upon its cleavage to its intracellular
            domain, p75ICD, trafficking of p75ICD to the nucleus, and functioning of p75ICD as
            a transcription factor. Mitochondrial Complex II comprises 4 subunits, all of which
            are encoded by nuclear DNA. We therefore hypothesized that the fenretinide-potentiating
            effects of p75NTR are the result of transcriptional enrichment of Complex II by p75ICD.
            However, the present studies demonstrate that neither induced expression of p75ICD
            or its active fragments nor overexpression of p75NTR results in altered expression
            or activity of Complex II.

         <title>1. Introduction</title>
         <p>Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood. It derives
            from the neural crest and commonly presents clinically in the adrenal gland or sympathetic
            chain. Fenretinide, a retinoic acid derivative, is under active clinical investigation
            for the treatment of neuroblastoma. Unlike all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which is
            used to induce cellular differentiation in the treatment of cancer, fenretinide is
            known to cause apoptosis through generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
            thought to “leak” from Complex II [

            by which p75NTR enhances the accumulation of reactive oxygen species from Complex
            II in the mitochondria is not known. The presently described studies test the hypothesis
            that the intracellular domain of p75NTR (p75ICD), a transcription factor, enhances
            the expression and/or enzymatic activity of Complex II.

            <p>We tested our hypothesis that p75NTR expression and cleavage to p75ICD alter expression
               and activity of mitochondrial Complex II by inducing p75ICD expression in NIH 3T3
               fibroblasts because these cells are p75NTR- (and, therefore, p75ICD-) negative in
               their native state. NIH 3T3 cells were used after transfection with either a V5 tag-containing
               plasmid (mock) or a p75ICD plasmid construct containing the V5 tag. In addition, induction
               of expression of p75ICD, p75ICD lacking the chopper domain, or p75NTR death domain
               in NIH 3T3 cells was performed by transfection as we have previously described [

               </span>]. Briefly, full-length p75ICD and Chopper- or death domain-deleted p75ICD constructs
               were cloned with a V5 epitope into the pBig2i-IRES-eGFP doxycycline- (Dox-; Sigma-Aldrich,
               St. Louis, MO) regulated plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmids were transfected
               into NIH 3T3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and stable lines were selected
               for resistance to Hygromycin (400 mg/mL; Invitrogen). Construct inducibility was verified
               by fluorescence microscopy for GFP expression and Western blot analysis for p75ICD
               fragment expression after Dox exposure for 36–48 h. Individual GFP-positive and GFP-negative
               clones were isolated for study.

               and cloned in frame with V5 epitope into pcDNA3.1 TOPO V5 His plasmid (Invitrogen).
               The successful cloning of p75ICD plasmid was verified by sequencing. Cells were then
               plated at 70% confluency 24–48 h prior to transfection; 2 × 10

         <p>Our prior studies have also shown that expression of p75NTR enhances the oxidative
            and cytotoxic effects of fenretinide. p75NTR is a neurotrophin receptor signaling
            through which cleavage and nuclear trafficking of its intracellular domain are involved,
            thought to be a transcription factor [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">
               <sup>

            </span>]. The four subunits of mitochondrial Complex II are all encoded by nuclear DNA. We
            therefore hypothesized that enhancement by p75NTR of fenretinide-induced accumulation
            of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species from Complex II results from upregulation
            of the subunits of Complex II by p75ICD.
         </p>
         <p>The present studies demonstrate that, while p75ICD does indeed traffic to the nucleus,
            neither p75ICD nor the fragments responsible for its activity induce enhanced mRNA
            or protein expression or enzymatic activity of Complex II in NIH 3T3 cells. Enhancement
            of the anticancer efficacy of fenretinide by p75NTR is therefore not the result of
            a direct effect of the transcription factor, p75ICD, on expression of the source of
            mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Our previous studies have demonstrated that
            the effects of p75NTR on fenretinide-induced oxidation and cell death are dependent
            upon p38MAPK phosphorylation, JNK phosphorylation, caspase 3 activation, Akt cleavage,
            and decreased Akt phosphorylation [

            </span>]. In addition, treatment with fenretinide results in upregulation of p75NTR, MKK4,
            and MEKK1 and phosphorylation of MKK3/6 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">

            </span>]. Future studies aimed at identifying exploitable mechanisms through which efficacy
            of fenretinide against neuroblastoma and other cancers might best determine the relationship
            between these signaling effectors and mitochondrial accumulation of reactive oxygen
            species released at the level of Complex II.

         <title>5. Conclusion</title>
         <p>Fenretinide is a chemotherapeutic agent in clinical trials for the treatment of neuroblastoma.
            The low bioavailability of this drug makes enhancement of bioavailability or efficacy
            imperative. Expression of p75NTR enhances fenretinide-induced oxidative cell death.
            But, despite the release from p75NTR of the transcription factor, p75ICD, this effect
            is not the result of enhanced expression of Complex II, an effector of the cellular
            activity of fenretinide.
