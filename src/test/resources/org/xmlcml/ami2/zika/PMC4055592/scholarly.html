         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A female resident of Townsville, Queensland, Australia has been diagnosed with Zika
            virus infection following a recent trip to the Cook Islands. An initial serum sample
            collected in March, 2014 was positive by two separate Zika virus TaqMan real-time
            RT-PCRs and a pan-Flavivirus RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetics of the
            complete Cook Islands Zika virus envelope gene revealed 99.1% homology with a previous
            Cambodia 2010 sequence within the Asian lineage. In addition, IgG and IgM antibody
            seroconversions were detected between paired acute and convalescent phase sera using
            recombinant Zika virus serology assays. This is the first known imported case of Zika
            virus infection into northern Queensland where the potential mosquito vector &lt;i&gt;Aedes
            aegypti&lt;/i&gt; is present and only the second such reported case diagnosed within Australia.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A member of the family 
            <i>Flaviviridae</i>, genus 
            <i>Flavivirus</i>, Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of medical significance which, like
            dengue virus (DENV), has caused outbreaks of human infection in Africa, Asia and the
            Pacific region. Natural transmission and onset of human disease follows the bite of
            an infected mosquito and predominantly involves the 
            <i>Aedes</i> species, including the domestic vector 
            <i>Aedes aegypti</i>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</span>. Primarily maintained in a zoonotic cycle involving non-human primates, ZIKV was
            first isolated in 1947 from a febrile rhesus monkey placed as a sentinel animal in
            the Zika Forest, Uganda
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</span>. Alternatively, humans may be implicated as amplification and reservoir hosts in
            regions not inhabited by non-human primates
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</span>.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Typically, clinical manifestations of human ZIKV disease are similar to many arboviral
            infections that occur without serious complications and may include a self-limiting
            febrile illness, arthralgia, myalgia, headache and maculopapular rash
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span>
            <sup>,</sup>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</span>
            <sup>,</sup>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</span>. Conjuctivitis, retro-orbital eye pain, lymphadenopathy and diarrhoea have also been
            reported
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</span>. However, in comparison with the diagnosis of infections caused by the more prevalent
            arboviruses DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), many clinicians and laboratories are
            not yet familiar with ZIKV and consequently may miss or incorrectly diagnose ZIKV
            infections
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</span>.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Within Southeast Asia, distribution of human ZIKV infection has been found in several
            countries including Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. Seroprevalence in Lombok and Indonesia
            has also been reported revealing evidence of human neutralising antibodies
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</span>. In 2007, an unprecedented outbreak of ZIKV occurred on Yap Island, Micronesia, most
            probably originating from a Southeast Asian strain
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</span>
            <sup>,</sup>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span>. More recently, ZIKV has been rapidly spreading unchecked across the South Pacific
            since 2013 causing epidemics in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Easter Island and
            the Cook Islands
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</span>. Although no local transmission has been recorded in Australia, the close proximity
            of ZIKV activity in surrounding regions and increased importation of related arboviruses
            such as DENV and CHIKV via viraemic travelers potentially compounds disease detection
            and constitutes a major public health concern. Additionally, 
            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes are currently only found in Queensland and the Torres Strait which are
            already under regular threat from sporadic DENV outbreaks. Another implicated ZIKV
            mosquito vector, 
            <i>Aedes albopictus</i> has been identified in the Torres Strait and could potentially become established
            on the mainland
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</span>. Importation of at least one case of ZIKV into Australia has been previously reported
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</span>. Here we describe the first reported case and diagnosis of ZIKV infection from a
            returned traveler into Townsville, north Queensland from the Cook Islands

         <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Acute and convalescent serum samples collected 8 days apart from a 65 year old female
            were tested at Forensic and Scientific Services (FSS), Queensland. Patient information
            provided on acute sample submission included 2 days of illness with symptoms of rash,
            lethargy, nausea and joint pain and history of recent travel to the Cook Islands in
            March, 2014. Suspected as a possible ZIKV infection, several assays were employed
            to attempt diagnosis of the illness including routine flavivirus screening. Of note,
            we were able to trial in-house molecular and serological ZIKV assays which were developed
            to potentially enhance laboratory capability and provide rapid and specific testing
            until live ZIKV stocks and positive patient control samples can be obtained. Molecular
            assays included two specific ZIKV real-time RT-PCRs designed in the envelope (E) and
            nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) genes respectively: ZIKV-E, Zika E For Primer: 5’-1222AAGTTTGCATGCTCCAAGAAAAT1244-3’,
            Zika E Probe: 5’-FAM-1246ACCGGGAAGAGCATCCAGCCAGA1268-TAMRA-3’, Zika E Rev Primer:
            5’-1293CAGCATTATCCGGTACTCCAGAT1271-3’ and ZIKV-NS1, Zika NS1 For Primer: 5’-3329GCACAATGCCCCCACTGT3346-3’,
            Zika NS1 Probe: 5’-FAM-3349TTCCGGGCTAAAGATGGCTGTTGGT3373-TAMRA-3’, Zika NS1 Rev Primer:
            5’-3394TGGGCCTTATCTCCATTCCA3375-3’ (sequence positions based on ZIKV Yap 2007 GenBank
            accession number EU545988) using assay conditions as previously described
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</span>. A pan-flavivirus heminested RT-PCR targeting the non-structural protein 5 gene
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</span> was also performed.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Serological assessment of both acute and convalescent phase serum was performed using
            flavivirus IgG and IgM ELISAs and an in-house flavivirus IgM typing microsphere immunoassay
            (MIA) (C. Taylor, unpublished data). These assays utilise pooled and individual flavivirus
            antigens which include DENV 1-4, but exclude ZIKV. Patient serum was also tested using
            novel ZIKV IgG and IgM MIAs which incorporated recombinant ZIKV NS1 protein expressed
            in baculovirus (A. Pyke and P. Moore, unpublished data).

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The real-time RT-PCR assays targeting either the E or NS1 gene regions both detected
            ZIKV RNA in the acute patient serum sample with cycle thresholds of 29 and 28 respectively.
            This corresponded with positive RNA detection using the pan-flavivirus heminested
            assay. Additional nucleic acid sequencing of E and NS1 regions revealed 100% homology
            between patient ZIKV sequences and corresponding E and NS1 primer/probe TaqMan sequences.
            Although full validation of the E and NS1 ZIKV TaqMan assays is currently constrained
            due to limitations described above, specificities were assessed and no cross-reactivity
            with RNA from several other arboviruses was detected (Table 1).

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">With only three designated genotypes, West African (Senegal/Nigerian), East African
            (Uganda) or Asian, ZIKV is most closely related to Spondweni virus (SPOV)
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span>. Due to limited availability of sequence data, the specific geographical origin(s)
            of the Yap, Cambodian or current Cook Island ZIKV strain(s) remains unknown; however
            it is most likely that introduction and sustained transmission of a Southeast Asian
            ZIKV strain(s) is responsible
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span> and is causing widespread epidemics across the Pacific region.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Whilst DENV and CHIKV are not endemic in Australia, both viruses are regularly imported
            through viremic travelers, particularly from the Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia
            and other Southeast Asian countries. Within Australia, north Queensland and the Torres
            Strait are frequently susceptible to arbovirus transmission and human outbreaks due
            to the presence of suitable mosquito vectors and have historically experienced recurring
            DENV epidemics. The importation of yet another exotic arbovirus into north Queensland
            such as ZIKV underscores the region’s constant vulnerability to incursion and heightened
            risk of widespread disease. A popular tourist destination, north Queensland is in
            close geographical proximity to surrounding countries and locales experiencing ZIKV
            activity and rapid spread of the Asian lineage across the Pacific would indicate this
            strain is both genetically robust and highly sustainable in immunologically naïve
            populations. Should the Pacific ZIKV outbreak continue to spread unchecked or viral
            mutation(s) occur, similar to that of CHIKV in the Indian Ocean which increased virus
            transmission in the mosquito vector
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</span>, this could exacerbate both importation rates and case numbers. Together with the
            similar clinical syndrome and degree of cross-reactivity of patient ZIKV antibodies
            with related flaviviruses
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</span>
            <sup>,</sup>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span>
            <sup>,</sup>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</span>, these factors necessitate a wider public health awareness for specifically identifying
            potential ZIKV cases and continued vigilance through accurate and rapid reporting,
            diagnosis and vector control.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In this short case report, we have described the first known identification and diagnosis
            of ZIKV infection in a patient returning to north Queensland. In the absence of ZIKV
            stocks and positive control patient samples, we were able to design and develop both
            molecular real-time RT-PCR and recombinant serological ZIKV assays in readiness prior
            to this importation. Although flavivirus serology strongly indicated a possible previous
            DENV infection, seroconversions of IgG and IgM were only demonstrated using the ZIKV
            recombinant NS1 MIAs. Interestingly, these findings from the recombinant MIAs were
            consistent with a recent ZIKV infection and correlated with molecular detection of
            ZIKV RNA in the acute phase sample.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Whilst further validation of the ZIKV real-time TaqMan and recombinant serology protocols
            is in progress, they have afforded rapid and potentially specific diagnosis of ZIKV
            infection in the patient who had traveled to the Cook Islands. This is not only relevant
            for laboratories with a high throughput of samples, but also emphasizes that pre-development
            of protocols for exotic viruses in the absence of viral or patient control material
            can be valuable to enhance capabilities and provide important and timely detection
            of future cases and outbreak events.
