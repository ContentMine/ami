Natural transmission and onset of human disease follows the bite of an infected mosquito and predominantly involves the <italic>Aedes</italic> species, including the domestic vector <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Primarily maintained in a zoonotic cycle involving non-human primates, ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 from a febrile rhesus monkey placed as a sentinel animal in the Zika Forest, Uganda<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Alternatively, humans may be implicated as amplification and reservoir hosts in regions not inhabited by non-human primates<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Typically, clinical manifestations of human ZIKV disease are similar to many arboviral infections that occur without serious complications and may include a self-limiting febrile illness, arthralgia, myalgia, headache and maculopapular rash<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Conjuctivitis, retro-orbital eye pain, lymphadenopathy and diarrhoea have also been reported<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. However, in comparison with the diagnosis of infections caused by the more prevalent arboviruses DENV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), many clinicians and laboratories are not yet familiar with ZIKV and consequently may miss or incorrectly diagnose ZIKV infections<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Within Southeast Asia, distribution of human ZIKV infection has been found in several countries including Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. Seroprevalence in Lombok and Indonesia has also been reported revealing evidence of human neutralising antibodies<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. In 2007, an unprecedented outbreak of ZIKV occurred on Yap Island, Micronesia, most probably originating from a Southeast Asian strain<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. More recently, ZIKV has been rapidly spreading unchecked across the South Pacific since 2013 causing epidemics in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Easter Island and the Cook Islands<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Although no local transmission has been recorded in Australia, the close proximity of ZIKV activity in surrounding regions and increased importation of related arboviruses such as DENV and CHIKV via viraemic travelers potentially compounds disease detection and constitutes a major public health concern. Additionally, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are currently only found in Queensland and the Torres Strait which are already under regular threat from sporadic DENV outbreaks. Another implicated ZIKV mosquito vector, <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> has been identified in the Torres Strait and could potentially become established on the mainland<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Importation of at least one case of ZIKV into Australia has been previously reported<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Here we describe the first reported case and diagnosis of ZIKV infection from a returned traveler into Townsville, north Queensland from the Cook Islands</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Acute and convalescent serum samples collected 8 days apart from a 65 year old female were tested at Forensic and Scientific Services (FSS), Queensland. Patient information provided on acute sample submission included 2 days of illness with symptoms of rash, lethargy, nausea and joint pain and history of recent travel to the Cook Islands in March, 2014. Suspected as a possible ZIKV infection, several assays were employed to attempt diagnosis of the illness including routine flavivirus screening. Of note, we were able to trial in-house molecular and serological ZIKV assays which were developed to potentially enhance laboratory capability and provide rapid and specific testing until live ZIKV stocks and positive patient control samples can be obtained. Molecular assays included two specific ZIKV real-time RT-PCRs designed in the envelope (E) and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) genes respectively: ZIKV-E, Zika E For Primer: 5&#x02019;-1222AAGTTTGCATGCTCCAAGAAAAT1244-3&#x02019;, Zika E Probe: 5&#x02019;-FAM-1246ACCGGGAAGAGCATCCAGCCAGA1268-TAMRA-3&#x02019;, Zika E Rev Primer: 5&#x02019;-1293CAGCATTATCCGGTACTCCAGAT1271-3&#x02019; and ZIKV-NS1, Zika NS1 For Primer: 5&#x02019;-3329GCACAATGCCCCCACTGT3346-3&#x02019;, Zika NS1 Probe: 5&#x02019;-FAM-3349TTCCGGGCTAAAGATGGCTGTTGGT3373-TAMRA-3&#x02019;, Zika NS1 Rev Primer: 5&#x02019;-3394TGGGCCTTATCTCCATTCCA3375-3&#x02019; (sequence positions based on ZIKV Yap 2007 GenBank accession number EU545988) using assay conditions as previously described<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.

Additional nucleic acid sequencing of E and NS1 regions revealed 100% homology between patient ZIKV sequences and corresponding E and NS1 primer/probe TaqMan sequences. Although full validation of the E and NS1 ZIKV TaqMan assays is currently constrained due to limitations described above, specificities were assessed and no cross-reactivity with RNA from several other arboviruses was detected (Table 1).</p><p><table-wrap orientation="portrait" id="d35e217" position="float"><label>Table 1.

Due to limited availability of sequence data, the specific geographical origin(s) of the Yap, Cambodian or current Cook Island ZIKV strain(s) remains unknown; however it is most likely that introduction and sustained transmission of a Southeast Asian ZIKV strain(s) is responsible<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and is causing widespread epidemics across the Pacific region.</p><p>Whilst DENV and CHIKV are not endemic in Australia, both viruses are regularly imported through viremic travelers, particularly from the Pacific, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. Within Australia, north Queensland and the Torres Strait are frequently susceptible to arbovirus transmission and human outbreaks due to the presence of suitable mosquito vectors and have historically experienced recurring DENV epidemics. The importation of yet another exotic arbovirus into north Queensland such as ZIKV underscores the region&#x02019;s constant vulnerability to incursion and heightened risk of widespread disease. A popular tourist destination, north Queensland is in close geographical proximity to surrounding countries and locales experiencing ZIKV activity and rapid spread of the Asian lineage across the Pacific would indicate this strain is both genetically robust and highly sustainable in immunologically na&#x000ef;ve populations. Should the Pacific ZIKV outbreak continue to spread unchecked or viral mutation(s) occur, similar to that of CHIKV in the Indian Ocean which increased virus transmission in the mosquito vector<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, this could exacerbate both importation rates and case numbers. Together with the similar clinical syndrome and degree of cross-reactivity of patient ZIKV antibodies with related flaviviruses<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, these factors necessitate a wider public health awareness for specifically identifying potential ZIKV cases and continued vigilance through accurate and rapid reporting, diagnosis and vector control.</p><p>In this short case report, we have described the first known identification and diagnosis of ZIKV infection in a patient returning to north Queensland. In the absence of ZIKV stocks and positive control patient samples, we were able to design and develop both molecular real-time RT-PCR and recombinant serological ZIKV assays in readiness prior to this importation. Although flavivirus serology strongly indicated a possible previous DENV infection, seroconversions of IgG and IgM were only demonstrated using the ZIKV recombinant NS1 MIAs. Interestingly, these findings from the recombinant MIAs were consistent with a recent ZIKV infection and correlated with molecular detection of ZIKV RNA in the acute phase sample.</p><p>Whilst further validation of the ZIKV real-time TaqMan and recombinant serology protocols is in progress, they have afforded rapid and potentially specific diagnosis of ZIKV infection in the patient who had traveled to the Cook Islands. This is not only relevant for laboratories with a high throughput of samples, but also emphasizes that pre-development of protocols for exotic viruses in the absence of viral or patient control material can be valuable to enhance capabilities and provide important and timely detection of future cases and outbreak events.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors have declared that there are no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Correspondence</title><p>Alyssa Pyke: Alyssa.Pyke@health.qld.gov.au</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are grateful to the Tropical Public Health Unit, Townsville and FSS Virology staff who contributed to the collection, processing and analysis of the patient serum samples.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Hayes EB.
