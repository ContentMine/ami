         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p>Slave trading of Africans to the Americas, during the 16th to the 19th century was
            responsible for the first recorded emergence in the New World of two arthropod-borne
            viruses (arboviruses), yellow fever virus and dengue virus. Many other arboviruses
            have since emerged from their sylvatic reservoirs and dispersed globally due to evolving
            factors that include anthropological behaviour, commercial transportation and land-remediation.
            Here, we outline some characteristics of these highly divergent arboviruses, including
            the variety of life cycles they have developed and the mechanisms by which they have
            adapted to evolving changes in habitat and host availability. We cite recent examples
            of virus emergence that exemplify how arboviruses have exploited the consequences
            of the modern human lifestyle. Using our current understanding of these viruses, we
            also attempt to demonstrate some of the limitations encountered in developing control
            strategies to reduce the impact of future emerging arbovirus diseases. Finally, we
            present recommendations for development by an international panel of experts reporting
            directly to World Health Organization, with the intention of providing internationally
            acceptable guidelines for improving emerging arbovirus disease control strategies.
            Success in these aims should alleviate the suffering and costs encountered during
            recent decades when arboviruses have emerged from their sylvatic environment.

         <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
         <p>Despite the announcement of the successful eradication of smallpox in 1979, the last
            case of rinderpest in 2008 and the current campaigns to eradicate poliomyelitis and
            measles through mass-immunization programmes, we still face the prospect of emerging
            or reemerging viral pathogens that exploit changing anthropological behavioural patterns.
            These include intravenous drug abuse, unregulated marketing of domestic and wild animals,
            expanding human population densities, increasing human mobility, and dispersion of
            livestock, arthropods and commercial goods via expanding transportation systems. Consequently,
            the World Health Organization concluded that acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
            tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases will remain challenges for
            the foreseeable future.

            attracted high levels of publicity. However, many other RNA viruses have emerged or
            reemerged and dispersed globally despite being considered to be neglected diseases.

            whose combined figures for morbidity and mortality far exceed those for Ebola, severe
            acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses. For instance,
            for DENV, the number of cases of dengue fever/hemorrhagic fever is between 300–400
            million annually, of which an estimated 22 000 humans die.

            Europe and parts of Asia through infected individuals returning from these newly endemic
            regions. This is an increasingly worrying trend. For example, in France, from 1 May

            of fatalities. In contrast, arthropods infected by arboviruses do not show detectable
            signs of sickness, even though the virus may remain in the arthropod for life. As
            of 1992, 535 species belonging to 14 virus families were registered in the International
            Catalogue of Arboviruses.

            procedures and sequencing methods impact on virus studies. Whilst many current arboviruses
            do not appear to be human or animal pathogens, this large number of widely different
            and highly adaptable arboviruses provides an immense resource for the emergence of
            new pathogens in the future.

         <h2>ARBOVIRUS TRANSMISSION VECTORS</h2>
         <p>In addition to evolving strategies for long-term survival, arboviruses have an enormous
            choice of arthropod species potentially capable of being infected the predominant
            species of which appear to be mosquitoes and ticks. Approximately 300 types of mosquito
            can transmit arboviruses. 
            <i>Aedes</i> and 
            <i>Culex</i> mosquitoes are the species most frequently associated with arbovirus transmission
            (115 and 105 types of arbovirus, respectively).
            <sup>

            </sup> Ticks are also prevalent vectors, 116 different species are currently known to transmit
            arboviruses. In addition, 25 midge species have been shown to transmit arboviruses,
            mainly 
            <i>Culicoides</i> (24 types) and 
            <i>Lasiohelea</i>. Sandflies, blackflies, stinkbugs, lice, mites, gadfly, and bedbugs can also transmit
            arboviruses.

            other arthropod species, in which viruses have been identified, may be involved in
            perpetuating the virus life cycle without having been associated with overt disease
            in humans or animals. For example, WNV is typically mosquito-borne but can be vectored
            by many different mosquito species and also by ticks and other arthropods.

            <i>Culex</i>, 
            <i>Anopheles</i>, and other mosquito species, as well as midges, sandflies and ticks. As a general
            rule, a specific arthropod species, is likely to predominate during an epidemic. However,
            if the availability of the vertebrate host, for example birds, becomes limited towards
            the end of the summer as the birds migrate to warmer countries, the vector might switch
            its preference to a different vertebrate host. This is consistent with the observation
            that outbreaks of West Nile fever/encephalitis in North America often appear to occur
            in the late summer, following peak incidence in birds, after they commence their migration
            to warmer regions.

            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> has adapted to the urban environment whereas 
            <i>Aedes albopictus</i> occurs more commonly in semi-urban or rural areas. However, these are not hard and
            fast rules. For example, on the French island of La Reunion, where 
            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> was not recognizably present, CHIKV was simultaneously epidemic in both rural and
            urban environments, and was primarily associated with

         <h2>WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION OF ARBOVIRUSES AND THEIR MOBILITY</h2>
         <p>A high proportion of arboviruses associated with human and animal disease circulate
            in tropical, and subtropical regions, where mosquitoes, and other flying insects,
            tend to be abundant. However, many arboviruses also circulate amongst wildlife species
            in temperate regions of the world. Despite the global distribution of viruses such
            as WNV, dengue virus, bluetongue virus and now CHIKV, most other arboviruses are generally
            endemic to specific regions of the world. For example, mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis
            virus is prevalent in India, Central and Southeast Asia, largely due to the prevalence
            of highly competent 
            <i>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</i> mosquito species and intensely farmed pigs which act as amplifying hosts for the
            virus and, importantly, the mosquitoes.

         <h2>ARBOVIRUS SURVIVAL STRATEGIES</h2>
         <p>Arboviruses have evolved a wide variety of strategies to ensure their long-term success,
            dispersal and survival. They associate with specific arthropods and exhibit distribution
            characteristics that reflect the environmental preferences of these particular species.
            However, once an epidemic has run its course, the virus survives via its sylvatic
            life cycle which may involve a wide variety of species currently not identified. Alternatively,
            arboviruses can be maintained for months or maybe even years in mosquito eggs which
            remain dormant until the rainy season triggers hatching of the new, healthy but infected
            mosquito larvae.

            </sup> Eggs can also provide a long term reservoir for tick-borne arboviruses but in many
            cases the viruses exploit the extended life cycle of some tick species, surviving
            for years through the transstadial stages, reproducing at low levels.

            </sup> This long-term survival strategy is also enhanced by non-viraemic transmission during
            which infected and non-infected ticks co-feed on small animals in the forests. Non-viraemic
            transmission provides an efficient mechanism for transmission of the virus directly
            between ticks, without necessarily infecting the vertebrate host. Whilst co-feeding
            is taking place, virus infectivity in the tick salivary glands may increase by orders
            of magnitude presumably increasing virus transmission efficiency between the ticks.

         <h2>DETERMINANTS OF ARBOVIRUS EMERGENCE</h2>
         <p>Changing anthropological behaviour, climate change and high mutation frequency are
            important determinants of arbovirus emergence. Arboviruses adapt readily to new susceptible
            hosts by alteration of receptor specificity, transmission efficiency, antigenicity,
            and ecological and environmental conditions. Humans, livestock and/or domestic animals
            are not an essential part of this arbovirus life cycle. Therefore, unlike, smallpox
            virus, measles virus or poliovirus, arbovirus disease control based on humans, livestock
            and/or domestic animals cannot eradicate the arbovirus. Consequently, the reservoir
            for arboviruses in wild species places a limitation on our ability to control disease
            emergence. For instance, CHIKV was a zoonotic arbovirus that cycled harmlessly between
            simians and mosquitoes in the African tropical forests causing localized outbreaks
            of polyarthralgia in humans. It also occasionally “escaped” to Asia gradually becoming
            zoonotic. However, prior to 2005, CHIKV was rarely an epidemic arbovirus until a mutation
            occurred in the gene encoding the surface protein of the African strain which increased
            its capacity to infect, reproduce and be transmitted by the striped Asian “Tiger”
            mosquito 
            <i>Aedes albopictus</i>.

         <h2>STRATEGIES FOR ARBOVIRUS CONTROL</h2>
         <p>The concept of arthropod-borne disease transmission was born out of the studies of
            a physician, Josiah Clark,

            empirical methods, such as mosquito eradication, which was used very successfully

            potentially fatal infection by yellow fever virus.

            </sup> Now, in the 21st century genetically engineered live attenuated vaccines can be manufactured
            within months, to protect humans against the ravages of pandemic influenza and other
            virus diseases. Moreover, a spectrum of antiviral molecules has been developed to
            treat humans dying from infection with human immunodeficiency virus and several antiviral
            drugs have also been developed against other viruses. Does this mean that if we develop
            vaccines and antiviral drugs to prevent or treat humans against infection by pathogenic
            arboviruses we will resolve the challenges associated with emerging arboviruses? Regrettably
            it is not that simple! It is a remarkable fact that in the future, because of their
            high mutation rates, many new pathogenic arboviruses will emerge even though they
            do not currently exist as epidemic strains in the sylvatic environment. It is also
            becoming clear, from early results of genome sequencing, that mosquitoes carry large
            numbers of known and unknown viruses that infect humans, primates, mammals, birds,
            insects, and plants.

            </sup> Therefore, should we attempt global eradication of arthropods? The answer is a definite
            no. This would have a catastrophic impact on the survival of many wildlife species,
            as first became apparent when dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was used widely as a
            general insect control agent rather than being precisely targeted to relevant mosquito
            species.

            </sup> However, implementation of temporary localized arthropod control measures during
            epidemics, for example in high density urbanized areas, can still play an important
            but transient role in reducing the impact on humans and animals of emerging arboviruses.

         <h2>CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY PATHOGENIC ARBOVIRUS</h2>
         <p>The breadth and depth of arbovirus surveillance differs regionally, and several areas
            lack surveillance altogether. There is also a lack of inter-disciplinary expertise
            on arbovirus diseases and understanding their vectors, and epidemiology. In addition,
            only a small number of arboviral diseases can be prevented using vaccines or specific
            antiviral drugs, and there are few validated diagnostic reagents, with which to monitor
            disease progress and control. Until such disease control reagents become available,
            the most effective alternative is to focus on practical procedures to reduce risks
            of exposure to arthropods.

         <h2>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARBOVIRUS CONTROL STRATEGIES</h2>
         <p>It is clear that we are now entering a period in virological discovery that will reveal
            a “Pandora's box” of new viruses with unique characteristics, which circulate in the
            ecosystem and will potentially lead to the evolution of novel pathogenic arboviruses.
            Future disease control strategies must therefore recognize this and be planned accordingly.
            What are the major objectives that need to be addressed if we are to win the war against
            these versatile viruses that appear to have an infinitesimal variety of strategies
            to confuse and disorganize our ability to bring them under control? (i) Develop vaccines
            to reduce the incidence of disease caused by known viruses; (ii) develop therapeutic
            drugs to treat clinical diseases caused by known viruses; (iii) develop unified vector-controlled
            strategies that will not unduly threaten the survival of wildlife species but locally
            will reduce the risk of disease in humans and animals; (iv) develop universal teaching/training
            courses to be taught worldwide, to provide cores of expertise to implement these policies;
            (v) encourage the strengthening of levels of cooperation between academia and drug
            and vaccine development companies; (vi) encourage the development of research programmes
            to understand the underlying mechanisms of arboviral pathogenicity, evolution, emergence
            and dispersal; (vii) develop, at the international level, public health measures to
            inform and educate citizens in local arboviral disease control measures, including
            monitoring and reporting; (viii) implement measures to improve monitoring procedures
            at borders, harbours, airports to reduce the influx of arthropods to new countries;
            (ix) develop unified public health strategies for arboviral disease control; (x) simplify
            the procedures for establishing safety and efficacy of antiviral drugs; (xi) establish
            an international committee of experts charged with the objective of reviewing global
            arthropod control strategies; (xii) develop and implement internationally acceptable
            and user-friendly guidelines for avoiding exposure to the different types of arthropod
            likely to carry human pathogens. This is undoubtedly an incomplete list of recommendations
            and probably some recommendations cannot easily be implemented. Nevertheless, the
            list provides the building blocks for a unified strategy on which to develop methods
            that will reduce the high morbidity and mortality rates due to human or animal arbovirus
            infections. Finally, we also have to recognise that arboviruses and arbovirus-related
            viruses infect more than just humans, invertebrates and land-based animals. They also
            infect plants, fish and marine animals. These relatively new discoveries also need
            to be accommodated if arboviral disease strategies are to be developed in a rational
            and unified manner. The lesson of the past is that human endeavour is at its best
            in the face of adversity. Let this be the mantra for arbovirus disease control in
            the future!
