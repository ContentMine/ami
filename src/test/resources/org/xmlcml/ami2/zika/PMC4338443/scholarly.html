         <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Yellow fever (YF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever transmitted by mosquitoes carrying
            the YF virus.-[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</span>] It affects an estimated 200,000 people globally and causes about 30,000 deaths annually.
            Case fatality rates in severe cases can exceed 50%. Estimates by WHO indicate that
            the true number of cases is close to 250 times the reported cases[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</span>] because mild cases can go undetected as the signs and symptoms of YF are similar
            to those of viral hepatitis, malaria, leptospirosis, typhus, Ebola and other viral
            hemorrhagic fevers.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In a 10 country yellow-fever protection test survey conducted in Central and East
            Africa between 1937 and 1943, it was demonstrated that YF had occurred in Zambia,
            then Northern Rhodesia.[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</span>] Robinson[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span>] reported that over 7% of more than 3000 blood samples from the population of the
            Balovale district in Kaonde-Lunda province now called North-Western province yielded
            positive results in protection tests. Many locations in the western part of Zambia
            in the Zambesi River basin were surveyed again in 1951-53; neutralizing antibodies
            were detected with a sero-prevalence up to 18%.[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</span>] Western province, then Barotse Province and Balovale were included in the African
            endemic YF area. Zambia's potential for YF transmission is unclear. In 2010, North-Western
            and Western provinces of Zambia were designated as YF low-risk regions by a WHO Yellow
            Fever Technical Working Group[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</span>] despite the fact that YF sero-prevalence studies were conducted six decades ago.
            In order to provide a more up-to-date sero-survey data, including results from tests
            for multiple flaviviruses, that will assist the WHO Yellow Fever Technical Working
            Group to confirm or refute the classification for Zambia, a study was conducted to
            determine the potential risk of YF infection in Western and North-Western provinces
            of Zambia.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The study was conducted in Western and North-Western provinces of Zambia. Western
               province with a population of 902,974 borders with Angola and had seven districts
               which were divided into 1902 SEAs.[
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</span>] It is the driest area of Zambia and located at 1119 m above sea level and latitude
               -15.0 and longitude 24.0. The province has mean minimum and maximum temperatures of
               8.7
               <sup>°</sup> C and 34.2
               <sup>°</sup> C in June and October, respectively, and an annual rainfall of 740 mm.[

               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</span>] Western province has two main agro-ecological zones: Major valleys as zone I and
               Kalahari sand plateau and Zambezi flood plains as zone II. Crop and livestock production
               as well as fishing were the main economic activities in the province.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">North-Western province located at 1354 m above sea level, latitude −13.0 and longitude
               25.0 has a population of 727,044 and borders with Angola on the western side and Democratic
               Republic of Congo on the northern side with population movement along the borders.
               It had six districts that were divided into 1178 Standard Enumeration Areas (SEAs).
               The province receives the highest rainfall, with annual rainfall of 1320 mm. The mean
               minimum temperature in June and mean maximum temperature in October is 6.8
               <sup>°</sup> C and 30.6

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This assessment was carried out among individuals aged 9 months or older. Any individual
               aged 9 months or older and who was a member of a sampled household and resident in
               the study site for at least seven days was eligible to participate in the survey.
               Individuals who received YF vaccination in the last 10 years to the survey were also
               eligible to participate in the survey.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Any person, who was either less than 9 months of age, or any person regardless of
               age, who resided in the study site for a period of less than seven days prior to the
               survey was excluded from the study. Determining the sero-prevalence in children under
               the age of 9 months raises the risk of false positive results as children under this
               age may still carry maternal antibodies from immunized or exposed mothers. We did
               not collect samples from non-human primates.

               were considered: A prevalence of 7%, desired precision or confidence interval (d)
               of ±3%, a design effect (DE) of 2 and an 80% response rate.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We aimed to recruit 700 male and 700 female participants in each province. Assuming
               an average of four persons aged 5 years or older in each household, a total of 12
               households in each of the 30 cluster was to be recruited in the survey. The total
               number of persons aged 5 years or older that would be recruited from each province
               was 1400.

               children, and in estimating the sample size for persons aged below 5 years, the following
               parameters were considered: A prevalence of 3.5%, desired precision or confidence
               interval (d) of ±3.4%, and a design effect (DE) of 2 and an 80% response rate. A total
               of 406 children aged below 5 years would be recruited for the survey.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The sample was drawn using a two-stage cluster sampling technique using probability
               proportional to size. A list of the standard enumeration areas (SEAs) in each province
               constituted the sampling frame. The line lists of the SEAs were provided by the Zambian
               Government's Central Statistics Office (CSO). The sampling was designed to achieve
               fairly good estimates at the provincial level of analysis, and not representing the
               subdivisions of the province.

         <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">YF virus was confirmed in both North-western and Western provinces with an overall
            prevalence of 0.3% (0.2% in North-western and 0.4% in Western provinces). All the
            cases of YF were adults aged 20 years or older. The YF virus was currently circulating.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The observed prevalence in the current study is far less than what was observed in
            1943 of 7%in the then Balovale area that includes the present Western and North-western
            province[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span>] and 18% in 1951-1953,[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</span>] indicating 95.7% or 98.3% decline in sero-prevalence, respectively. The difference
            in the rates may partly be due to differences in method of laboratory analysis of
            samples collected, the stages of the epidemic and due to malaria vector control efforts.
            Because recent infections were observed in the current study, the two provinces may
            be in the early stages of the YF epidemic. It is not clear at what stage of the epidemic
            the Balovale area was.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">While in the current study all cases of YF were of persons aged between 20 and 77
            years, cases in a study conducted in Senegal 2002 cases were aged 3 to 38 years and
            no case was aged 40 years or older.[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</span>] Children are more affected than adults because adults acquire natural immunity in
            a YF endemic area. The difference in the age distribution of the cases between the
            studies may partly be explained by the fact that YF was endemic in Senegal and potentially
            epidemic in the current study.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Previous studies have documented the presence of 
            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (L), 
            <i>Ae. simpsoni</i> (Theo.) and 
            <i>Ae. luteocephalus</i> (Newst.) and 
            <i>Ae. Africanus</i>.[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</span>] The control of these mosquitoes in Zambia include indoor residual spraying (IRS)
            and use of insecticide treated Nets (ITNs). The coverages of IRS as well of ITNs have
            increased nationwide. For example, the coverage of at least one ITN or recent IRS
            has increased from 43%in 2006 to 74% in 2012.[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</span>] High coverage rates may reduce human-vector contacts, and hence reduce the risk
            to viral infection. However, the coverage rate for IRS of 27.6% in North-western province
            and 14.3% in Western province; and that for ITNs of 56.9% in North-western province
            and 61.1% in Western province were lower than the national figures.

            <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The strength of the study lies in its large sample size. The samples were drawn using
               a two-stage cluster sampling technique using probability proportional to size and,
               hence, the samples are representative of the provinces. Although recall bias may have
               been introduced in our study, we are not able to determine its magnitude and direction.
               However, we believed that bias was minimum and that our findings may not have been
               significantly affected.

         <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">There is evidence of past and recent infection of YF in both provinces. Furthermore,
            the provinces border with areas where YF is endemic or transitional. Based on the
            classification of risk of transmission of YF virus by Jentes 
            <i>et al</i>.,[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</span>] the two provinces are at a low risk for YF infection. YF vaccination should be included
            in the EPI program in the two provinces. There is a need to strengthen the integrated
            disease surveillance and response (IDSR) in both provinces, given that diseases such
            as YF and other flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile and Zika) were not reported. Periodic
            follow-up risk assessment may be useful to document the risk in future complemented
            by strong surveillance.
