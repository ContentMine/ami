               the EPI program in the two provinces and strengthen surveillance with laboratory confirmation.

            to those of viral hepatitis, malaria, leptospirosis, typhus, Ebola and other viral
            hemorrhagic fevers.

            Balovale district in Kaonde-Lunda province now called North-Western province yielded
            positive results in protection tests. Many locations in the western part of Zambia

            In order to provide a more up-to-date sero-survey data, including results from tests
            for multiple flaviviruses, that will assist the WHO Yellow Fever Technical Working
            Group to confirm or refute the classification for Zambia, a study was conducted to
            determine the potential risk of YF infection in Western and North-Western provinces
            of Zambia.

         <h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">YF virus was confirmed in both North-western and Western provinces with an overall
            prevalence of 0.3% (0.2% in North-western and 0.4% in Western provinces). All the
            cases of YF were adults aged 20 years or older. The YF virus was currently circulating.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The observed prevalence in the current study is far less than what was observed in
            1943 of 7%in the then Balovale area that includes the present Western and North-western
            province[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">

                  <a href="#ref4">4</a>

            </span>] and 18% in 1951-1953,[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#ref5">5</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] indicating 95.7% or 98.3% decline in sero-prevalence, respectively. The difference
            in the rates may partly be due to differences in method of laboratory analysis of
            samples collected, the stages of the epidemic and due to malaria vector control efforts.
            Because recent infections were observed in the current study, the two provinces may
            be in the early stages of the YF epidemic. It is not clear at what stage of the epidemic
            the Balovale area was.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">While in the current study all cases of YF were of persons aged between 20 and 77
            years, cases in a study conducted in Senegal 2002 cases were aged 3 to 38 years and
            no case was aged 40 years or older.[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">

                  <a href="#ref14">14</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] Children are more affected than adults because adults acquire natural immunity in
            a YF endemic area. The difference in the age distribution of the cases between the
            studies may partly be explained by the fact that YF was endemic in Senegal and potentially
            epidemic in the current study.

            </span>] High coverage rates may reduce human-vector contacts, and hence reduce the risk
            to viral infection. However, the coverage rate for IRS of 27.6% in North-western province
            and 14.3% in Western province; and that for ITNs of 56.9% in North-western province
            and 61.1% in Western province were lower than the national figures.

            <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The strength of the study lies in its large sample size. The samples were drawn using
               a two-stage cluster sampling technique using probability proportional to size and,
               hence, the samples are representative of the provinces. Although recall bias may have
               been introduced in our study, we are not able to determine its magnitude and direction.
               However, we believed that bias was minimum and that our findings may not have been
               significantly affected.

         <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">There is evidence of past and recent infection of YF in both provinces. Furthermore,
            the provinces border with areas where YF is endemic or transitional. Based on the
            classification of risk of transmission of YF virus by Jentes 
            <i>et al</i>.,[
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#ref16">16</a>
               </sup>
            </span>] the two provinces are at a low risk for YF infection. YF vaccination should be included
            in the EPI program in the two provinces. There is a need to strengthen the integrated
            disease surveillance and response (IDSR) in both provinces, given that diseases such
            as YF and other flaviviruses (Dengue, West Nile and Zika) were not reported. Periodic
            follow-up risk assessment may be useful to document the risk in future complemented
            by strong surveillance.
