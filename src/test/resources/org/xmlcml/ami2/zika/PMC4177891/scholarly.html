            commonly aggressive human biters, and because they often reach high abundance, create
            significant nuisance. One of these species, the Asian tiger mosquito 
            <i>Aedes albopictus,</i> is an important vector of emerging infectious diseases, such as dengue, chikungunya,
            and Zika fevers. Integrated mosquito management (IMM) of 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> is particularly difficult because it requires access to private yards in urban and
            suburban residences. It has become apparent that in the event of a public health concern
            due to this species, homeowners will have to be active participants in the control
            process by reducing mosquito habitats in their properties, an activity known as source
            reduction. However, limited attempts at quantifying the effect of source reduction
            by homeowners have had mixed results. Of note, many mosquito control programs in the
            US have some form of education outreach, however the primary approach is often passive
            focusing on the distribution of education materials as flyers. In 2010, we evaluated
            the use of active community peer education in a source reduction program, using AmeriCorps
            volunteers. The volunteers were mobilized over a 4-week period, in two areas with
            approximately 1,000 residences each in urban Mercer and suburban Monmouth counties
            in New Jersey, USA. The volunteers were first provided training on peridomestic mosquitoes
            and on basic approaches to reducing the number of container habitats for mosquito
            larvae in backyards. Within the two treatment areas the volunteers successfully engaged
            758 separate homes. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed a significant reduction
            in container habitats in the sites where the volunteers actively engaged the community
            compared to untreated control areas in both counties. Our results suggest that active
            education using community peer educators can be an effective means of source reduction,
            and a critical tool in the arsenal against peridomestic mosquitoes.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Container-inhabiting mosquitoes, such as 
            <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Skuse) and 
            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> L., are serious nuisance pests and vectors of disease-causing pathogens to humans.
            Because of their close contact with human populations, and their vector competence
            for chikungunya, dengue, and other arboviruses 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Mitchell1">[1]</span>, they are important targets for control. 
            <i>Aedes albopictus</i>, which is also commonly referred to as the Asian tiger mosquito, oviposits in residential
            containers, which can be numerous and hard to detect and treat 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Unlu1">[2]</span>. Therefore, control of mosquito larvae, which forms the basis of peridomestic Integrated
            Mosquito Management (IMM), is often difficult over large areas 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Fonseca1">[3]</span>. Source reduction, the removal of habitat used by mosquito larvae, can greatly affect
            the distribution of mosquito larvae in a neighborhood 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Richards1">[4]</span>, by limiting the amount of habitats for ovipositing mosquitoes and can lead to significantly
            lower number of adult mosquitoes 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Fonseca1">[3]</span>. In the United States, where this study was conducted, the most common container
            habitats in residential areas are those classified as non-disposable, such as bird
            baths, trash cans, planters, plant dishes, and toys 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Unlu1">[2]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. This is similar to studies in other countries that have shown water holding containers,
            such as flower vases 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Spiegel1">[6]</span> and water pots 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-HoedojoSuroso1">[7]</span> are important habitats for 
            <i>Aedes aegypti.</i> These types of habitats can be difficult to eliminate, since they require public
            knowledge and engagement in control efforts. Without the public’s involvement in evaluating
            and managing standing water habitats weekly, these containers will continue to be
            potential oviposition sites for mosquitoes throughout the course of a season 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Unlu1">[2]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Richards1">[4]</span>. Therefore, public educational campaigns may have beneficial effects on vector control
            within those communities 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Fonseca1">[3]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Swaddiwudhipong1">[8]</span>, by teaching the public how to maintain or eliminate these types of habitats to prevent
            mosquitoes from completing their development. Community participation is an essential
            and cost-effective means of reducing container mosquitoes but requires community ownership
            to achieve sustainability 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-LaDeau1">[9]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Gubler1">[10]</span>. When successful, the investment in community participation can significantly impact
            populations of container-inhabiting mosquitoes through source reduction of container
            habitats, although the impact on adult populations is not always immediately observed
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Winch1">[11]</span>.

            a whole and involve local leaders, in an attempt to help the community become self-reliant.
            Community organization and participation can be used as a means of intensifying source
            reduction efforts. However, for community participation programs to be effective,
            they must clearly define the participation roles, as well as optimally involve community
            leaders and/or local government 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Winch1">[11]</span>. Soedarmo 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Soedarmo1">[12]</span> used community participation in Indonesia as a method of controlling dengue hemorrhagic
            fever outbreaks. In their program, they trained community members, who were each responsible
            for providing health education to 500 homes. After 3 months, they found a 56% reduction
            in larval indices, which measure the prevalence of larvae in containers and levels
            of infestation 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Soedarmo1">[12]</span>. A similar study by Phanthumachinda et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Phanthumachinda1">[13]</span> in Thailand, showed a significant reduction in the Breteau index, a standard measure
            of mosquito infestation 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Focks1">[14]</span>, where community volunteers were trained in mosquito control. In a study in Texas,
            Warner et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Warner1">[15]</span> found that high school students were an excellent resource for teaching members of
            the community regarding health behaviors. One caveat to source reduction programs
            is that they do not always reduce the risk of disease transmission 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Bowman1">[16]</span>. However, given that these mosquitoes are important nuisance species, these programs
            can also benefit the public through reduction of habitats, potential reduction in
            biting adults 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Fonseca1">[3]</span>, and through promoting mosquito control programs in an area.

            of educational materials, which focused on the message of removing standing water
            from backyards 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. Educational brochures and other passive forms of media were then distributed to
            all members of communities in two sites in New Jersey 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Fonseca1">[3]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. The goal of our passive education program was to reduce populations of Asian tiger
            mosquitoes that use peridomestic containers, and were creating nuisance concerns in
            the areas. Although our education efforts had a significant impact, it was of limited
            magnitude (&lt;20% reduction in container habitats in the educational study areas) and
            we were unable to observe a significant reduction in the numbers of containers when
            compared to control sites not receiving education 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Fonseca1">[3]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. In retrospect we found that a high proportion of residents had education levels
            at or below the high school level so that providing just reading materials was not
            the most appropriate strategy for our target audience 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. Therefore in 2010 we decided to utilize an active community organization public
            health education approach, where members of the community were approached by peer-volunteers
            that provided verbal information about public health threats regarding mosquitoes
            and mosquito-borne diseases. This also involved active demonstrations of ways to minimize
            the occurrence of peridomestic mosquitoes. We employed a door-to-door campaign, where
            a large proportion of the community was actively involved in the educational process.
            We also included additional community events to help increase source reduction efforts.

               corps ambassador program representatives, and a team trainer. Although all team members

               the AmeriCorps team initiated additional media releases and volunteer opportunities
               within the communities, which directly benefited our program. From June 21

               mosquito biology and source reduction of containers. They were asked to work through
               various problems and scenarios. Scenarios included images and photographs of backyard
               habitats, as well as role-playing techniques in simulated backyard habitats. Volunteers
               were trained to make positive comments in each home, regarding things that homeowners

               around the front and back yard with the resident, describing current and potential
               mosquito habitats. Volunteers were paired in four to five teams of two, with each
               team given a daily list of approximately 18 homes to visit. In the interest of volunteer
               comfort and safety, all teams conducted active education within nearby blocks in the

               within the community was left at the residence. We left this information in plastic
               bags hanging from the residence’s front door-handle. This type of information dissemination
               is commonly referred to as “door-hangers”. Door-hangers were also given to residents
               we spoke to, since it was our primary means of informing residents about the dates
               and types of other educational events in the community.

               resident was home, containers observed, the type of activities and level of education
               performed, and other observations. A residence was only considered “educated” if they
               actively walked around the property with the team members. Politely accepting a brochure
               did not constitute being educated. At the end of the day, the teams were asked to
               fill out a summary form of their activities. The summary form included the number
               of homes visited, number of abandoned homes, number of homeowners educated, not home,
               or refusing education, languages other than English, reasons for refusing education,
               types of containers at the site, service requests for mosquito control, and other
               activities associated with mosquito reduction (such as collecting tires or drilling

               events in both treatment areas. In Monmouth County we left door-hangers advertising
               free home consultations, community workshops, and tire pick up days. The door hanger
               was provided to residents whether or not they were home during the active educational
               events, so all residents would be aware of the date and time of events. The free home
               consultations included a phone number to call to schedule an expert to inspect the
               house and show the resident how to reduce mosquitoes. The community workshops included
               two single hour events where residents could learn how to protect themselves from
               mosquitoes in their backyard. For the tire-pick up days, residents were asked to leave
               out their unwanted tires on the curb in front of their house for pick up. At the end
               of the study, the advertisement for the tire disposal was expanded to other areas
               in the bay shore of Monmouth County, New Jersey. In Mercer County, we used door-hangers
               to advertise free home consultations, tire pick up days, and trash can drilling days.
               For the trash can drilling days, residents were asked to leave their trash cans out
               at the curb, so volunteers could drill drainage holes in the bottom.

            <h3>Container surveys</h3>
            <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Container surveys were conducted before the educational events (June and July), after
               education (August), and two to three months after treatment (October and November)
               using methodologies and treatment and control sites previously described 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. Each treatment site receiving education was compared to a demographically similar
               site that received no education (the control site). In Monmouth County, NJ, the control
               sites were located in Union Beach Borough, and in Mercer County, the control sites
               were located in Hamilton. These sites were similar in parcel size and demographics
               to the treatment sites in Monmouth County (Cliffwood Beach), and Mercer County (Trenton)
               
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Unlu2">[18]</span>. Container surveys were conducted by manually counting every container, water-filled
               container (wet), containers infested with larvae, and containers infested with pupae
               at each surveyed home. Survey teams would walk the entire property (front, back, and
               side yards) inspecting all potential container habitats. Containers were defined as
               anything natural or manmade whose shape and structure allows it to collect and hold
               water for 2 or more days. We also included a category called “managed containers”
               (a container that has been deliberately turned upside down, covered, chlorinated,
               aerated, or maintained in a way that would prevent the collection of water or the
               production of mosquitoes). An “unmanaged container” was any container that fit the
               definition of “container” above, and was not being “managed” as described above. Since
               we were simply looking at behavior change (measured by reduction of habitats), we
               did not identify larvae or pupae to species. At each home, a spread sheet was used
               to record the address, date, time of survey, container type, number of containers,
               number of water-filled containers, and those infested with larvae and/or pupae. All
               containers, larvae, and pupae were left undisturbed during the container surveys,
               as not to affect future survey results. We did not collect samples or identify the
               larvae or pupae to species. In Monmouth County, approximately 50 homes each were selected
               in the treatment and control sites. In Mercer County, approximately 75 homes each
               were selected in the treatment and control sites. Homes were selected using Geographic
               Information System (GIS) technology, using grids to separate out the treatment and
               control areas into 50 (Monmouth) or 75 (Mercer) zones. The home closest to the center
               of each grid, when permission was granted, was selected as our survey location. Due
               to several homes opting out of the study, the final data include 47 treatment and
               45 control sites in Monmouth County, and 64 treatment and 64 control sites in Mercer
               County.

               the AmeriCorps and community events were deployed was compared with those in the paired
               untreated control sites using a repeated measures analysis of variance in SPSS software
               (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). This analysis allowed us to examine the change in the homeowner’s
               behavior over time (source reduction behavior) in residences receiving education versus
               those not receiving education. The Breteau index (number of water-filled containers
               containing larvae and/or pupae per 100 homes) and house index (percentage of homes
               infested with larvae/pupae) were calculated for each site during each sampling period
               
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Focks1">[14]</span>. The Breteau index is an internationally recognized index of container-inhabiting
               mosquito populations, which allowed us an additional measure of suitable habitats
               in the treatment and control sites. We were not attempting to estimate disease transmission
               risk using these indices. The number of positive (contains larvae and/or pupae) and
               negative containers per treatment area were compared using Chi Square analysis (SPSS).
               We performed a spatial analysis, where total number of unmanaged containers for each
               sampled residence were plotted using ArcMAP GIS (North American Datum 1983). For each
               site and month, maps were created using inverse distance weighted (IDW) mapping tools.
               The parameters for the IDW included using a variable search radius, references the
               12 closest points, and weighting those points closest heavier than those further away
               (IDW squared). The color reference scales for map interpolations were standardized
               to the same scale, and compared by looking at overall trends in the dataset. These
               interpolations allowed us to ascertain if the numbers of containers per home were
               uniformly distributed or were influenced by homes with large numbers of containers
               per yard. We calculated the difference between pre-educational survey interpolations
               and interpolations of surveys immediately following education using ArcMAP’s spatial
               analyst math tools. This analysis allowed us to examine the overall change in behavior
               spatially (positive or negative) regardless of the variation in the number of containers
               per home. Difference maps were color coded either black (increase in containers) or
               grey (decrease or no change in containers). The resulting image was analyzed in ImageJ
               by calculating out the total black and grey geometric areas within each image. A chi
               square analysis of the resulting geometric area was performed to assess whether observed
               behavioral changes between residents pre-education and immediately following education
               were independent of educational events within the community.

               homes. The remaining parcels consisted of open areas, parks, businesses, and abandoned
               homes. It was estimated that 126 homes within the treatment area were considered abandoned
               (12%). Of the 962 occupied homes, 507 homes (52.7%) contained at least one individual
               at home during our educational interventions. Of these, 364 were willing to walk around
               the yard with the educators, while 143 refused. The primary reason (26%) for not wanting
               to be educated was that they were “too busy” (

            program for mosquito control agencies locally and nationally in the USA. We hope that
            our study will provide a foundation or a model for local, state, and national organizations
            faced with implementing an emergency response to mosquitoes and mosquito-borne disease
            epidemics. The use of volunteers during these emergencies can help facilitate the
            interaction with the public, to ensure that the public is informed regarding ways
            to minimize risk.

            in the communities being educated (treatment site), compared to a 32.3% increase in
            the sites not receiving education (control sites). Interestingly, trends in container
            abundance were similar for both counties. Prior to this study, we had evaluated passive
            educational techniques in promoting source reduction behavior 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. Although we observed some source reduction behavior during the passive education
            study, the educational study sites were not statistically different from the control
            sites, and showed the same trends throughout the season 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. These results were similar to other studies that had relied on passive forms of
            education 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Schreiber1">[19]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Schrebier1">[20]</span>. As with the 2010 results, we observed similar trends in both counties in 2009. During
            our previous study in 2009, we observed a willingness to help empty standing water
            on their property, when we had an interaction with the homeowner. In addition, we
            felt the presence of mosquito personnel counting containers could have indirectly
            motivated residents to conduct source reduction 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy1">[5]</span>. This led us to hypothesize during our previous study that an active education campaign
            could better promote source reduction behavior in the community. We feel our current
            results support this hypothesis, given the significant differences in the repeated
            measures analysis through active education, compared to the lack of a significance
            using passive education

            to walk around their back yard with our community peer educators. By itself, this
            finding underscores the impact of mosquitoes on our communities, as several studies
            have shown that 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> influences the quality of life and outdoor activities of both adults and children

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Worobey1">[22]</span>. Halasa et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Halasa1">[23]</span> conducted a survey of individuals within our communities and found that mosquitoes
            prevented 74% of the respondents of the survey from enjoying outdoor activities. Even
            without the real threat of disease, biting pressure caused by mosquitoes appears to
            provide enough motivation within the community for individuals to actively get involved
            in their control. Indeed, Dickinson and Paskewitz 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Dickinson1">[24]</span> showed that nuisance is a more important motivator than disease risk, a result that
            may seem counterintuitive but should be garnered by public health officials and mosquito
            control programs.

            to be educated, we found that several of these residents still participated in community
            events. Over 20% or residents participating in the tire pick up days had refused education
            from our community peer educators. Tires are an important mosquito habitat for 
            <i>Ae. albopictus,</i> and comprise a large percentage of the container habitats in our study areas 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-BartlettHealy2">[25]</span>. Therefore, targeted interventions towards specific container types can provide an
            important means of reducing primary habitats from within a community.

         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our study showed a significant reduction of container habitats in both treatment areas
            receiving education versus the control sites not receiving education. The reduction
            was not sustained, since we saw some increase in containers over time. However the
            percent increase in container habitats in the education sites over the entire season
            (5.6%) was far less of that in the control sites (52.1%). In addition, the increase
            in container habitats needs to be assessed in the context of the entire season. In
            the warm and humid summers in New Jersey, the number of water-filled containers increases
            over the summer as residents spend more time outdoors and rain events fill them with
            water. This increase is readily exploited by 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> females that maximize their offspring’s fitness by spreading their eggs across many
            containers 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Fonseca2">[26]</span>. Overall, the sites where the community was engaged twice during the season (in July
            and middle August) still maintained a lower number of sources of peridomestic mosquitoes
            as indicated by the overall number of container habitats, a trend that was observed
            in both counties.

            in the Monmouth county treatment parcels compared to the control. However, we did
            not see the same trend in the Mercer county parcels. The low Breteau indices in Mercer
            likely reflect the fact that 2010 was a record hot and dry year in New Jersey 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-NewJersey1">[27]</span>, which depressed the population of 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> significantly in the very urban and therefore warmer Trenton site 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Crepeau1">[28]</span> but not in Monmouth. In 2010, August and September were relatively dry months, which
            could have reduced availability of habitat for container mosquitoes. In Mercer county,
            very few containers (1.7% of all sampled) contained water during the final survey.
            This was very different to what was seen in Monmouth County, where 30.4% of all sampled
            containers in the final survey contained water. Therefore, the two counties should
            be evaluated independently when considering larval indices.

            homeowners by having one of the co-authors visit a property as it was visited by one
            of the teams. Each day, a different team was evaluated to assess their quality. We
            found all teams were always polite and did an excellent job in pointing out things
            homeowners were doing correctly. However, since the volunteers were not mosquito biologists
            or control experts, there were occasional instances where a fully or partially inconspicuous
            container habitat would go unnoticed. The quality of education may have therefore
            varied from team to team and throughout the study. However, our expectation is that
            once a homeowner becomes educated regarding mosquito habitats, they can sustain source
            reduction efforts by continually finding sources of habitats on their own property.
            This is essential, since source reduction efforts done solely by mosquito control
            personnel, in the absence of sustained effort, can result in the repopulation of key
            mosquito habitats

            mosquito management program, there are other volunteer organizations that could participate
            in mosquito control activities. These include the Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), Boy
            Scouts of America, church groups, citizen scientists, community volunteers, and agricultural
            extension programs. The Medical Reserve Corps has volunteers in every state, and most
            often in the most populated counties within those states. The mission of the MRC is

            diseases. In addition, extension agents associated with state universities in the

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Bowman1">[16]</span>, the goal of this study was not to reduce or estimate transmission risk, but to examine
            several measures to estimate source reduction behavior within the community. Given
            that our public education message was to reduce container habitats, we felt that container
            surveys were a more reliable estimate of source reduction behavior, given that education
            does not always result in immediate reduction in adult mosquito populations

            through public messages are often short term 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Brieger1">[34]</span>, future community based programs must promote the public to be self-sufficient 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0108504-Perez1">[33]</span>. Therefore, every effort should be made to involve the community when developing

            reduction of mosquito habitats for mosquitoes, especially 
            <i>Ae. albopictus,</i> an important vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. Since

            for the control of these important species as well. Studies have shown that the most
