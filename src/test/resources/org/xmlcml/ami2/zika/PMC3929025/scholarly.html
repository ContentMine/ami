            is primarily based on studies of church attendance or prayer and wellbeing, more recent
            work has focused on the potential mechanisms that may mediate the religion-wellbeing
            findings. One of the major function of religion is finding of meaning of life and
            improving hope. Recent studies have indicated that hope and meaning of life are the
            potential variables mediate between religion and wellbeing. It was hypothesized that
            one pathway through which religiosity may exert its positive influence on psychological
            wellbeing is through finding meaning of life and improving hope. One study was conducted
            examining the relationships among spiritual experiences, hope, meaning of life and
            psychological wellbeing operationalized as satisfaction with life, positive affect
            and negative affect. The following research tools were used: Daily Spiritual Experiences
            Scale, Purpose in Life Test, Hearth Hope Index, Cantril Ladder, Positive and Negative
            Affect Schedule. Meaning of life and hope were noticed to mediate between spiritual
            experiences and satisfaction with life as well as between spiritual experiences and
            positive affect. Spiritual experiences were not related to negative affect. Both meaning
            of life and hope predicted negative affect. This study found meaning of life and hope
            to be an important factors in the religion-wellbeing relationship and related to positive
            psychological outcomes, including improved satisfaction with life and positive affect
            as well as reduced negative affect.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The survey of the literature has revealed the researchers’ trends for searching for
            the variables that mediate between the religious and spiritual aspects of the functionality
            of an individual and his or her wellbeing (Jones

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2006</span>). The researchers have tried to confirm that faith and religious-spiritual commitment
            favors hope (Wnuk

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</span>), a sense of inner control (Fiori et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</span>), subjective sense of health (Zullig et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2006</span>), and employing religious coping (Roesch and Ano

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</span>) which, in consequence, lead to an increase in individual wellbeing.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Thus far, the strongest empirical foundation has been formed by the conviction that
            religious-spiritual aspects of functionality are the source of the meaning of life,
            resulting indirectly in the improvement of psychological wellbeing. (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</span>; Wnuk et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</span>; Steger and Frazier 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</span>; Zika and Chamberlain 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</span>; Vilchensky and Kravetz 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</span>; French and Joseph 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</span>). In the study by Steger and Frazier, conducted among the students of psychology,
            the meaning of life mediated between religious involvement and satisfaction with life
            (Steger and Frazier 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</span>). Another study, performed among Israeli students, revealed a mediating role of the
            meaning of life between religious faith and psychological wellbeing or distress (Vilchensky
            and Kravetz 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Among the Al-Anon group members, spiritual experiences were the source of meaning
            of life leading indirectly to an increase in satisfaction with life as well as to
            the distress level decrease (Wnuk et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</span>). A parallel study was conducted among the Alcoholics Anonymous with the application
            of different wellbeing indicators. The increase in the frequency of spiritual experiences
            was revealed to be conducive to finding the meaning of life in alcohol addicts being
            members of the Alcoholics Anonymous community and finally reduced the hopelessness
            level (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Other studies proved that the relationship between the attitude toward Christianity
            and the sense of happiness was mediated through the meaning of life (French and Joseph
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</span>). The results of studies conducted on a large sample of women were ambiguous. Apart
            from one measure of the meaning of life, this variable mediated between religiousness
            and the cognitive aspect of wellbeing in the form of the satisfaction with life. The
            meaning of life turned out not to mediate between religiousness and emotional indicators
            of psychological wellbeing in the form of negative and positive affect, irrespective
            of which research tool had been employed (Zika and Chamberlain 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</span>). Similarly, among the Alcoholics Anonymous, the meaning of life was a variable that
            mediated between the religiousness indicators such as intrinsic religiousness, strength
            of religious faith, positive religious coping and the satisfaction with life (Wnuk
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</span>). That regularity has not been confirmed in relation to affective measures of psychological
            wellbeing, which seem to indicate that religiousness through the function of finding
            the meaning of life can influence only the cognitive components of wellbeing.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Among the entire range of approaches dealing with the meaning of life in psychology,
            the best known and widespread is logotheory, posed by the Viennese psychiatrist and
            philosopher, Victor Frankl (Auhagen 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2000</span>). Frankl’s inspiration to articulate this therapy originates from the time spent
            in a concentration camp during the World War II. He noticed that in spite of severe
            physical deprivation, the prisoners who were able to find the meaning in the events
            happening to them were able to stay alive, while those who were not able to find purpose,
            experienced feelings of hopelessness, emptiness or senselessness, which, coupled with
            loss of physical vitality and stamina, led to disease and death (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1962</span>). According to Frankl, people have a natural disposition toward developing the meaning
            of life, which motivates them to analyze and search for a purpose in the events in
            which they participate. The later research confirmed that the ability to identify
            a purpose is an element 
            <i>sine qua non</i> of the sense of happiness (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1977</span>). Individuals having problems with finding a purpose in their lives experience a
            state of “existential emptiness” characterized by feeling of boredom, anhedonia, hopelessness
            and the lack of motivation for engaging themselves in activity (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1973</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Psychological wellbeing is a multidimensional idea. Its cognitive aspect is satisfaction
            with life, while its emotional indicators are positive and negative affects (Diener
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1984</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Apart from the meaning of life, a religious-spiritual area of functionality seems
            to be an additional source of hope (Gibson 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</span>; Craig et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</span>; Frey et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</span>). Among chronically ill inhabitants of rural areas, a moderately strong positive
            correlation has been observed between spirituality and hope (Craig et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1999</span>). In HIV-infected individuals, hope correlated positively with spiritual wellbeing
            (Abdel-Khalek 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</span>), whereas in women with breast cancer, hope correlated with the individual awareness
            of inner ego and the sense of connection with the “Higher Power” (Gibson 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2003</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Among students, hope positively correlated with life satisfaction (Abdel-Khalek 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</span>; Chang 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1988</span>; Gilman et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</span>) and positive affect (Snyder et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1998</span>; Michael and Snyder 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2005</span>). The results of previous studies appear to confirm the fact that the increase in
            hope induced by religious-spiritual factors is manifested by better quality of life
            and wellbeing. Among the Alcoholics Anonymous, spiritual experiences mediated by hope
            were reflected by a lower level of hopelessness measured with the Beck’s Hopelessness
            Scale (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</span>). The results of the research by Wnuk on the same population showed that hope played
            a mediating role between frequency of prayer and positive affect (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</span>). Also, among the group-supported addicts, spiritual experiences, coupled with a
            high level of hope, indirectly influenced satisfaction with life and a distress level
            (Wnuk et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Hope has been found to be an important and valuable factor in the life of an individual.
            Regardless of the approach, the studies on hope highlighted its multidimensional character.
            Hope reflects spheres of thought, feelings, behaviors, and relationships with other
            people. It consists of an element of predictability; it is future oriented but rooted
            in the present (Stephenson 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1991</span>), and connected with the past sense of hope.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">In medicine, the most frequent tool used to study hope is the Herth Hope Index. Hope
            is operationalized as a multidimensional, dynamic force of life, described as a certainty
            of achieving good, which for a hopeful individual is possible and personally important
            (Dufault and Martocchio 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1985</span>). According to this theory, hope is based on three main factors: the inner sense
            of time and future, the inner positive readiness and expectation, and the sense of
            connection with oneself and others. The first of them is manifested through the presence
            of goals, positive attitude toward the world, a conviction that every day brings a
            new chance, and carefree thoughts about the future. The inner positive readiness and
            expectation is realized through the ability to notice positive aspects, the feeling
            of being guided, conviction that life has meaning, and the ability to recall happy
            and joyful moments.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The feeling of connection with oneself and others refers both to oneself as well as
            to God and other people. It is realized due to the conviction of not being alone,
            comfort-giving faith, deep inner strength, and the ability of giving and receiving
            love (Herth 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1992</span>). The main hope-supporting strategies are meaningful relations with other people,
            the ability of carefree feeling, determination, possessing courage and serenity, clear
            goals, spiritual convictions (faith), the ability of recalling positive memories and
            respecting and accepting the individuality of others (Herth 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1990</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This paper purposely integrates the religious and spiritual spheres. The terms ‘spirituality’
            and ‘religiousness’ are usually used interchangeably, as equivalents. According to
            the previous studies, some aspects of spirituality and religiousness are closely connected,
            whereas other spiritual spheres are loosely connected or independent of religious
            behaviors and motives (Heintz and Baruss 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2001</span>). Nevertheless, spirituality seems to be an idea having a broader meaning than religiousness.
            Unlike religiousness, spirituality assumes the realization of non-religious goals,
            such as identity, affiliation, health, or wellbeing (Sawatzky et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2005</span>). It means that one can develop spiritually without being religious. On the other
            hand, spiritual experience is the crucial element of religious development (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2008</span>).

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The first hypothesis has been confirmed to quite a large extent. According to the
            results of the previous research, spiritual experiences were indirectly related to
            satisfaction with life, and the variable mediating the relation between them was the
            meaning of life (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</span>; Wnuk et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</span>; Steger and Frazier 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</span>; Zika and Chamberlain 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The results of the present study have confirmed a significant role of the meaning
            of life as a variable mediating between religious and spiritual indicators of functionality
            and quality of life, regardless which tools and measures were applied to verify both
            these variables and how different the studied populations were. It confirms the universal
            character of the presented model, proving that the function of the religious-spiritual
            sphere of existence is the discovery of the meaning of life due to which an individual
            can experience wellbeing, happiness, and satisfaction with life.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The aforementioned correlations have been observed in the population of students,
            representatives of the Alcoholics Anonymous, and women, when both positive and negative
            measures of wellbeing were applied such as happiness, satisfaction with life, distress,
            or hopelessness. There were also numerous religious-spiritual indicators employed,
            comprising religious involvement through the strength of faith, religious motivation,
            attitude toward Christianity, positive religious coping, and spiritual experiences
            (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</span>; Wnuk et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</span>; Steger and Frazier 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</span>; Vilchensky and Kravetz 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</span>; French and Joseph 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</span>). The only exception to the above-mentioned rule was the results of the study conducted
            among women, with the application of affective indicators of wellbeing. This study
            has shown that the activity of the religious-spiritual sphere was neither directly
            nor indirectly related to quality of life (Zika and Chamberlain 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Contrary to the previous study, the meaning of life mediated between spiritual experiences
            and one of the two emotional indicators of wellbeing in the form of positive affect
            (Zika and Chamberlain 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1988</span>). These differences can be explained with the dissimilarities between the studied
            populations and different measures applied to investigate the religious-spiritual
            sphere. This means that the students’ spiritual experiences have the influence, through
            the mediating role of the meaning of life, not only on the cognitive indicators of
            psychological wellbeing, but also on its emotional aspects, however, only on those
            of a positive nature.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The results of this study have revealed that one of the crucial functions of religiousness/spirituality
            was the discovery of the meaning of life, which could be explained on the basis of
            the mechanisms of coping with stress by means of religious-spiritual values. The religious-spiritual
            activity through the meaning can play an important role in the process of coping with
            stress, in the stage of both primary and secondary assessment of the stress-generating
            situation. In the stage of the primary assessment, the influence of a stressor can
            be restricted due to finding the meaning of the events through belief that no evil
            can happen without God’s allowance, or through the perception of the situation by
            an individual as a test of his or her faith. In the secondary stage of the assessment,
            an individual can reduce the negative influence of a stressful situation by discovering
            its meaning through acceptance, religious reattribution, due to comprehension why
            a specific event happened, or due to a positive reinterpretation through identification
            and focusing on positive implications of the event (Park 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2005</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The concepts of spirituality highlight four main dimensions such as relation toward
            the “Higher Power”, own self, other people, and natural environment (Tse et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</span>; Martsolf and Mickley 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1998</span>; Bloch 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</span>; Ingersoll and Bauer 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</span>; Dyson et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</span>). According to them, the crucial element, around which spiritual functionality of
            individuals concentrates, is the meaning of life (Dyson et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1997</span>; Chiu et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</span>; Graham et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2001</span>; Allen and Coy 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2004</span>; Genia 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2001</span>). The observed positive correlation between spiritual experiences and the meaning
            of life seems to prove this assumption.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A frequent feeling of coalescence with God, self-trust, a sense of integrity, identity
            and fellowship with others, as well as the awareness of the support of God and other
            people, probably allow the students to overcome their mental, biological, and social
            barriers. Due to it, they are able to find the meaning in their lives.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">A moderate nature of the relationship between the meaning of life and all applied
            indicators of psychological wellbeing shows a significant role of that variable in
            the students’ quality of life. The methods used in this study to a considerable extent
            support Frankl’s observations (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1977</span>), which indicated that finding the meaning of life leads to happiness. Happiness
            is the result of an effective discovery of the meaning in various situations and events
            in the life of an individual.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The second hypothesis has been partially confirmed by our analyses. Similarly to the
            meaning of life, it was hope, which mediated between spiritual experiences and satisfaction
            with life, as well as between spiritual experiences and positive affect. The obtained
            results are concurrent with the results of studies among addicted individuals, where
            identical measures of wellbeing and religiousness/spirituality were used (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</span>). Also, the use of other indicators of wellbeing among the members of the Alcoholics
            Anonymous, the meaning of life turned out to be a mediating factor between spiritual
            experiences and the sense of hopelessness (Wnuk 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our study has confirmed a significant role of religious-spiritual activity in creation
            of hope. It is highly probable that hope is positively influenced by the spiritual
            experiences manifested by the feeling of the presence of God, being the main source
            of joy, strength, peace and balance, feeling of God’s help and guidance, experiencing
            God’s love directly or via other persons, acceptance of other people regardless of
            their activities, feeling of integrity with own life, of identity with the beauty
            of the surrounding world, and selfless care for others. Hope, in turn, is reflected
            in positive goals, positive perception of the world, conviction that every day is
            a new chance, confidence in good future, positive thinking, feeling of guidance, appreciating
            the value of life, ability of recalling happy memories, belief in not being alone,
            faith which gives comfort, inner strength, and ability to give and receive love. The
            enumerated above factors decide on the students’ wellbeing, which is indicated by
            satisfaction with life and positive affect revealed by such emotions as excitement,
            inspiration, pride, positive attitude, determination, etc.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The previous studies showed that hope was the predictor of satisfaction with life
            (Abdel-Khalek 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</span>; Chang 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1988</span>; Gilman et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</span>) and positive affect among the students, which confirms its crucial role in the quality
            of life. Another finding was that the negative correlation between the strength of
            hope and negative affect.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Our studies have confirmed a positive role of hope and the meaning of life in creating
            students’ mental wellbeing. Identified relations concerned all indicators of mental
            wellbeing.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">According to Park’s model, both the meaning of life and hope were found to be variables
            mediating the relation between religiousness/spirituality and positive indicators
            of psychological wellbeing in form of satisfaction with life and positive affect (Park
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</span>). Although the study was conducted on a transverse model, the applied methods allow
            to determine, with high probability, the direction of relations between the used variables
            (Baron and Kenny 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1986</span>). Frequent spiritual experiences promote hope and the meaning of life, the consequences
            of which are more frequently occurring positive emotions and satisfaction with students’
            life.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Longitudinal studies could validate more the obtained relations between the above-mentioned
            variables by presenting them in the cause-effect perspective.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Designing a similar study among individuals experiencing a difficult situation in
            life such as among persons chronically ill, with the application of a greater number
            of religious-spiritual indicators, and a greater number and variety of measures of
            quality of life could give more interesting outcomes. The discovery of other sources
            of hope and the meaning of life, apart from religious-spiritual ones, might be employed
            in the designing of therapeutic activities for various groups of patients, especially
            for those who regard religious-spiritual values as insignificant or totally unimportant.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The inclusion of more differentiated study groups in terms of socio-demographic variables
            would allow to find out whether these variables are important for the relationship
            between religious-spiritual aspects of existence and quality of life. Such variables
            could modify the relations between religiousness/spirituality and quality of life.
            In the described project, nearly all subjects were peers, with similar education and
            affiliation to the same religious society, which enabled the testing of the influence
            of these variables.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The meaning of life and hope were related to both cognitive and emotional measures
            of psychological wellbeing, and mediated the majority of the relationships between
            spiritual experiences and quality of life. This is not the first study which examines
            the meaning of life and hope as potential pathways through which religiosity/spirituality
            influences quality of life and wellbeing. In the present study, this mechanism was
            confirmed once again with the use of specific measures of religiosity/spirituality,
            wellbeing and students’ population.
