         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This paper identifies the effectiveness of group logotherapy in reducing depression
            and increasing meaning in life levels of university students in Iran. A randomized
            controlled trial was conducted with a pre- post- and follow-up test design. The instruments
            used were the 
            <i>Purpose in Life</i> (PIL) test and the 
            <i>Beck Depression Inventory</i> (BDI). Data were collected from 10 subjects in an experimental group and 10 in a
            control group. The experimental group participated in 10 sessions of group logotherapy,
            whilst the control group received no intervention. The mean scores for depression
            levels was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group
            and significantly higher in regard to meaning in life. Results suggest that group
            logotherapy has the potential to reduce depression levels and improve the meaning
            in life of university students.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Depression is a significant contributor to the global burden of psychological distress
            and affects people in all communities across the world (WHO 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR25">2012</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). The effects involve a depressed mood, a loss of interest or pleasure, decreased
            energy, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep and appetite, and poor
            concentration (WHO 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR25">2012</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Today, it is estimated to affect 350 million people, with a World Mental Health
            Survey conducted in 17 countries finding that, on average, about 1 in 20 people reported
            having an episode of depression in the previous year (WHO 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR25">2012</a>
               </sup>
            </span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Depression may have a number of distinct causes, such as a chemical imbalance, environmental
            pressures, interpersonal problems, intrapersonal difficulties, lack of meaning in
            one’s life, or a combination of these (Allen-Meares 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR1">1995</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Many people experience their first onset of depression during college years. Unfortunately,
            many college students who have depression are not getting the help they need. They
            may not know where to go for help, or they may believe that treatment will not help.
            Others do not get help because they think that their symptoms are just part of the
            typical stress of college, or they worry about being judged if they seek mental health
            care (Eisenberg, Golberstein, and Gollust 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR8">2007</a>
               </sup>
            </span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The relative prevalence of depression in college students has also received much attention
            in the literature. Based on clinical diagnosis, depression in college students is
            more prevalent than in the general population—by some estimates about 11.8 % (14.3 %
            for females and 7.3 % for males), compared to about 5.2 % in the general population
            (American College Health Association 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR2">2006</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). Adverse outcomes include poor academic achievement, increased rates of substance
            use, co-morbid psychiatric conditions, and suicide (Moreno, Jelenchick, Egan, Cox,
            Young and et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">
               <sup>

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">During this stage of life, college students typically develop their self-identity
            and a sense of meaning and purpose in life. If they fail to find such purpose, they
            can readily lose confidence and can experience depression and a sense of meaninglessness.
            If they lack meaning and purpose in life, they are likely to experience existential
            emptiness, which involves a state of despair, in combination with depression, helplessness
            and emptiness (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">

            human motive, the loss of which is characterized by boredom, hopelessness, depression,
            and the loss of the will to live. Yalom (

            </span>) upheld that a human life without existential meaning can be very unsatisfactory
            and can result in major depression. Frankl (

               <sup>

            </span>) suggested that the most difficult psychological issue facing people in the modern
            world is existential emptiness due to a lack of meaning in life, and he developed
            a therapeutic approach called Logotherapy to address this most challenging hurdle.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Logotherapy is a psychological, therapeutic treatment to address the root of such
            problems. It helps people appreciate their existence, gain liberty from emotional
            distress, and find meaning and purpose in their lives. Having meaning in life is regarded
            as being aware of the overriding goals of one’s life that add purpose to everyday
            living and is a primary motivational force in humans (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Group logotherapy appears to be uniquely positioned to deal effectively with existential
            concerns. Yalom (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">
               <sup>

            </span>) offered an excellent explanation of this existentially normalizing group process.
            More specifically, he noted: “the group configuration is not ‘you,’ the therapist,
            and ‘they,’ the dying; but it is we who are dying, we who are banding together in
            the face of our common condition” (p. 34). Group logotherapy is, therefore, an attempt
            to leverage the therapeutic value of exploring issues of existence by capitalizing
            on the existentialism imbedded in the group process (Somov 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">
               <sup>

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Studies on the application of group logotherapy with university students have been
            few, in general and in regard to depression and issues of meaning in life, and few
            community mental health centers provide logotherapy in Iran. Therefore, the purpose
            of this experimental study was to test the effect of a group logotherapy approach
            with university students in Iran experiencing levels of depression and meaningless
            in life.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The following hypotheses were tested: (a) that participation in group logotherapy
            would improve university students’ sense of meaning in life and reduce depression
            levels, and (b) that the effects of such group logotherapy would be sustained at a
            one-month follow-up point.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The study followed a pre-test, post-test design with a one-month follow-up involving
               both an experimental and a control group. The participants of this study were students
               of the Shahid Chamran University in Ahvaz City, Iran. Approval to undertake the study
               was provided by the research committee in the Department of Clinical Psychology.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">From all the students studying for a Bachelor of Science degree, five hundred and
               six (506) students were selected following standard sampling procedures (Kerjcie and
               Morgan

                  </sup>
               </span>). Following assurances about confidentiality, the participants provided informed
               consent to be involved and completed instruments assessing their depression levels
               (Beck’s Depression Inventory) and their sense of meaning in life (Purpose in Life).
               One hundred and twenty-one (121) students among the 506 were found to have significant
               levels of meaninglessness and depression (i.e., those with scores of 100 and below
               in the PIL, and 13 and above in the BDI). Finally, from that group of 121, 20 students
               were randomly assigned to the experimental (10 students) and control (10 students)
               groups. The former, took part in 10 × 1 h weekly group logotherapy sessions at the
               university’s counseling centre, whilst the latter were placed on a waiting list for
               individual counseling. Post-test assessments were conducted for each group following
               the 10 week program period and at a one-month follow-up point.

               meaningful to them, 2) set reasonable goals, 3) assure that the goals would actualize
               the participants’ meaningful values, 4) set practical plans to achieve the goals,
               5) identify participants’ assets and deficits that would affect their attempts to
               achieve their goals, and 6) intentionally incorporate the assets and deficits into
               the plans to achieve the goals to actualize the values.

               values. This was accomplished by means of the Values Awareness Technique (VAT). Briefly,
               the VAT consists of a series of exercises, each of them involving a three-step format:
               i) Expanding Conscious Awareness - participants are instructed to observe their lives
               from a different perspective, ii) Stimulating Creative Imagination - participants
               are instructed to “brainstorm” many possible values that could underlie the results
               from step-1, iii) Projecting Personal Values - participants are instructed to select,
               out of the many step-2 results, those particular values that underlie their particular
               responses in step-1. Following several of these three-step exercises, participants
               were instructed to identify the values that they repeatedly selected during the exercises.
               After clarification of participants’ individual values, the focus was on goals - fitting
               goals with the values, setting new goals for values, planning for goal achievement,
               and undertaking ongoing current status analysis in regard to the process.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The notion of values within the approach is subcategorized into three main areas:
               creative, experiential, and attitudinal. Creative values are reached through acts
               of creating or producing something. Experiential values are actualized when a person
               experiences something through sight, touch, smell, or hearing. Finally, attitudinal
               values are reserved for individuals who cannot, for one reason or another, have new
               experiences or create new things. Thus they find meaning through adopting a new attitude
               that allows “suffering with dignity”.

            <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">For all of these classes of values, it is considered to be because of one’s sense
               of responsibility that one pursues such values and consequently experiences a meaningful
               life. It is through the realization that one is the sole being responsible for rendering
               life meaningful that values are actualized and life becomes meaningful (Feldman and
               Snyder

               ranging from 20 (low purpose) to 140 (high purpose). Raw scores of 113 and above are
               typically interpreted as high purpose, scores of 92–112 reflect moderate levels of
               purpose, and scores of 92 and below suggest a lack of life purpose (Crumbaugh and

               in life. They feel that there is meaning to their life, both currently and in the
               past, they hold beliefs that give life purpose, and they have meaningful aims and
               objectives for living. Low scorers are seen to lack a sense of meaning in life, have
               few goals, lack a sense of direction, do not see purpose in their past, and do not
               have meaningful outlooks on life (Ryff and Keyes

            scores as covariates and tested post-test scores in the experimental and control groups.
            There was a significant difference between the two groups in the dependent variables
            (Willks’ Lambda = .04, 
            <i>F</i> = 420.5, 
            <i>p</i> &lt; .001). The post-hoc tests showed that the mean score for the meaning in life variable
            was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (
            <i>F</i> = 290.48, 
            <i>p</i> &lt; .001) (see Fig.

            and there was a significant difference between the two groups in both dependent variables

            <i>F</i> = 323.4,

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Before the administration of the Logotherapy program, all of the participants in both
            groups (experimental and control) were assessed with having a lowered sense of meaning
            in life and high depression levels. This was in line with Frankl’s (

            </span>) description of people who would be experiencing what he termed an ‘existential vacuum’
            or a general sense of meaninglessness, which involves a state of despair, in combination
            with depression, helplessness and emptiness (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">
               <sup>

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Logotherapy, however, views individuals as having the potential to transcend their
            environments and the freedom and responsibility to make choices that are conducive
            to growth despite their circumstances. Logotherapy posits the following: (a) a primary
            and basically subconscious motivation in human existence is a “will to meaning,” and
            (b) meaninglessness, depression and other pathology often results when individuals
            are unable to identify and pursue a worthy sense of meaning (Brown and Romanchuk

            Blair (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">
               <sup>

            </span>) as he examined the principles of logotherapy among some older adolescents who perceived
            that their lives were devoid of meaning or who were facing difficult challenges and
            trying to make sense of those challenges. He observed the feeling of being lost among
            conflicting demands was especially true among youth who had not yet developed a clear
            sense of their own identities. These youth recurrently conformed to the values of
            their peers, even when these values were in opposition to their own personal beliefs
            (Pellebon and Anderson 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">
               <sup>
                  <a href="#CR18">1999</a>
               </sup>
            </span>). As a consequence of acting outside of their own value system, even when they are
            not fully aware of what that value system entails, such youth often feel in conflict
            with themselves and frequently manifest symptoms of meaninglessness, depression or
            other mental health problems. However, when given the opportunity to discuss and clarify
            their values and goals, they gain self-awareness and a clearer sense of identity and
            adhere to a personal value system, with the result being that their meaninglessness
            and depressive symptoms lessen.

            control group participants in this regard. There are some obvious reasons for the
            lack of improvement in the control group’s post-test and follow-up mean scores. The
            group was on a waiting list for counseling and did not receive any treatment, so their
            ‘existential vacuum’ identified in the initial assessments persisted. The members
            of the experimental group, on the other hand, were assisted to be able to exercise
            the most important freedom of all: the freedom to determine one’s own attitude and
            spiritual well-being.

         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">The findings suggest that the Logotherapy program had a positive effect on the depression

            </span>) observed, that people were able to value what was given to them, and what they valued
            guided their search for meaning and simplified their decision-making. Also, this result
            is clearly similar to Blair (

               <sup>

            and pursuing meaning is facilitated by helping them work through the following steps:
            (a) establishing the therapeutic relationship; (b) increasing insight regarding identity,
            values, and goals; (c) reframing meaninglessness and depression; (d) discovering meaning
            within the meaninglessness and depression; and (e) pursuing the fulfillment of meaning.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Going into greater depth, a crisis of meaning was experienced by participants. Frankl
            stated, “In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost” (Frankl

               </sup>
            </span>, p. 151). The accuracy of this thought was clearly realized by the participants of
            the experimental group during their first therapeutic session wherein they were encouraged
            to explore in the Group exercise: “What I want to be’ and an exploration of creative
            values. By the fourth session, through clarification of creative, experiential and
            attitudinal values, they were able to realize and appreciate the unique pattern of
            their personal values. This is based on what Frankl believed, that meaning could come
            through what we give to life and what we take from the world (Frankl 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">

               </sup>
            </span>). After helping the participants see the uniqueness of their personal values, they
            were encouraged to focus on goals - fitting goals with values, setting new goals for
            values and planning for goal achievement. Finally, participants were helped to make
            an active resolution to persevere in life despite the presence of the difficulties.

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">This group logotherapy program for university students in Iran with depressive symptoms
            and a low sense of meaning in life was found to be effective in reducing depression
            levels and enhancing a sense of meaning in life. Life without meaning is empty. Meaning
            is available to each individual under any circumstances because a person has the freedom
            of will and the will to define meaning.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Logotherapy potentially offers long-term relief from the underlying meaninglessness
            that is experienced by some university students. Though the existing empirical data
            are sparse, it is clear that Logotherapy deserves further research, not just as an
            adjunctive treatment, but, rather, as a structured and effective therapy for the treatment
            of meaninglessness and depression. Irvin Yalom (

            creature in a meaningless universe” (p. 230). This is an important dilemma that should
            be addressed in therapy with clients experiencing a sense of meaninglessness. Mental
            health professionals, regardless of theoretical allegiance, should engage with their
            clients and empower them with the responsibility to seek and create meaning.
