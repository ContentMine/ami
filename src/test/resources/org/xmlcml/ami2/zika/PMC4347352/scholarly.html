            <i>Aedes (Stegomyia)</i> were collected in response to the first chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak on Yap
            Island: the native species 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> Farner and the introduced species 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> (L.). Fourteen CHIKV-positive mosquito pools were detected. Six pools were composed
            of female 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i>, six pools were composed of female 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, one pool was composed of male 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i>, and one pool contained female specimens identified as 
            <i>Ae. (Stg.)</i> spp. Infection rates were not significantly different between female 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> and 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. The occurrence of human cases in all areas of Yap Island and the greater number
            of sites that yielded virus from 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> combined with the ubiquitous distribution of this species incriminate 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> as the most important vector of CHIKV during the outbreak. Phylogenic analysis shows
            that virus strains on Yap are members of the Asia lineage and closely related to strains
            currently circulating in the Caribbean.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a member of the genus 
            <i>Alphavirus</i> within the family 
            <i>Togaviridae</i>.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</span> The virus is endemic to Africa, India, and Asia. Phylogenetic analysis has shown
            that CHIKV form three major lineages, which represent adaption to regional conditions:
            an East, Central, South African (ECSA) lineage, a West African (WA) lineage, and an
            Asian lineage. Recently, international commerce and tourism have resulted in the introduction
            of viruses, particularly members of the ECSA and Asian lineages, into new geographic
            areas, resulting in epidemic outbreaks.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</span>
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The disease associated with CHIKV was first described during an outbreak in Tanzania
            that occurred from 1952 to 1953. Virus isolations from field-collected mosquitoes
            and experimental transmission studies established 
            <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (L.) as the primary epidemic vector of CHIKV.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</span> Subsequent studies in Africa detected a sylvan transmission cycle among wild primates
            and 
            <i>Ae. (Stegomyia)</i> and 
            <i>Ae. (Diceromyia)</i> mosquitoes including 
            <i>Ae. (Stg.) africanus</i> (Theobald), 
            <i>Ae. (Stg.) luteocephalus</i> (Newstead), and 
            <i>Ae. (Dic.) furcifer</i> (Edwards), but 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> remained the primary vector in early urban epidemics in both Africa and Asia.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</span> Experimental vector competence studies provided additional support for 
            <i>Ae. furcifer</i> as an epidemic vector and implicated 
            <i>Mansonia africana</i> (Theobald) as a potential vector in southern Africa.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</span> In 2004, CHIKV spread from Kenya onto the islands of the Indian Ocean, including
            Reunion Island and beyond.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</span> The epidemic on Reunion Island was unusual, because the epidemic vector was 
            <i>Ae. (Stg.) albopictus</i> (Skuse); and subsequent vector competence studies showed that a single mutation,
            E1-A226V, enhanced virus replication and transmission in 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i>.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</span> CHIKV continued to spread through infected human travelers, and autochthonous cases
            were reported in temperate Italy in 2007.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</span> Entomological studies in Italy also showed that 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> was the vector.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</span>
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">On October 19, 2013, the Yap State Department of Health Services of the Federated
            States of Micronesia (FSM) contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
            (CDC) concerning an outbreak of unexplained illness on Yap characterized by acute
            onset of fever, arthralgia, and rash (Pastula D and Hancock WT, personal communication).
            On October 30, the Arboviral Diseases Branch (ADB) diagnostic laboratory of the Division
            of Vector-Borne Diseases (DVBD) of the CDC in Fort Collins, CO identified CHIKV in
            multiple patient serum samples sent from Yap. An entomological team from the ADB was
            dispatched in November and conducted entomological surveillance on Yap from November
            13 to 18, 2013. Goals of the entomological surveillance team were to (1) implicate
            the vector(s) based on isolation of virus from field-collected specimens and (2) determine
            the infection rate (IR) in potential vector species.

            <span ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</span>). Detection of virus on multiple days at case-patient residences and in engorged
            specimens is indicative of continued transmission at these case-patients' homes. Bed
            nets were provided to hospitalized patients to limit transmission within the wards;
            however, bed nets and insect repellents were rare in homes and in very limited supply
            for outpatients from the hospital, making transmission from viremic outpatients to
            other residents of virus-positive homes likely. Although the entomological team did
            not attempt to document continued transmission within a household, we did observe
            instances where a hospital-identified case-patient was ill but recovering, whereas
            a different family member was severely ill with symptoms consistent with CHIKV.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The data from case-patient residence site 9, where five of six 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>-positive pools were identified and no 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> were collected, show that 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> is an efficient vector as expected. However, the greater number of sites that yielded
            virus in 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> and the much wider distribution and greater abundance of 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> on Yap suggest that 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> was a more important vector on Yap than 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. The epidemiological data also support this contention. Human CHIKV cases were reported
            from all municipalities on Yap, indicating that the vector had a wide distribution,
            and the highest attack rate was observed in Gagil (Pastula D and Hancock WT, personal
            communication), a rural municipality where 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> is abundant and 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> is limited in distribution. Virus-positive pools of 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> were also detected at the jail in central Colonia (site 3) and a residential property
            in the surrounding urbanized area (site 7), two sites where the ecology and larvae
            habitats should have been associated with greater 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> abundance.

            from four islands of Yap State: Fais, Eauripik, Ulithi Atoll, and Ifalik Atoll (Pastula
            D and Hancock WT, personal communication). Although entomological surveillance was
            not conducted on these islands during the CHIKV outbreak of 2013, previous entomological
            surveys documented that 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> was very common and that 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> were both absent on Fais (Aure F, unpublished data), Eauripik,

            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> has been incriminated as a vector based on multiple virus isolates from field-collected
            specimens. Recently, laboratory studies have provided additional support for the vector
            status of 
            <i>Ae. hensilli</i> for both CHIKV and Zika virus and weaker support for its role in dengue virus transmission.

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</span> detected virus-positive progeny at low rates (4.3 per 1,000) and only in progeny
            of the second gonotropic cycle. The epidemiological significance of vertical transmission
            is uncertain but coupled with venereal transmission, which has been shown in the laboratory
            for 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and CHIKV,

            similar, and all are members of the Asia clade of CHIKV (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</span>). The Yap strains are most closely related to a human isolate from the British Virgin
            Islands.
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</span> The Yap–British Virgin Islands clade is the sister group to a lineage including two
            viruses isolated during CHIKV activity in 2012 in Asia: one reported from the Philippines
            and one reported from a sailor in a Chinese port. This suggests that the CHIKV outbreaks
            in the Pacific and Caribbean are parts of one larger outbreak and that the virus associated
            with both outbreaks originated in Asia.

            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and 
            <i>Ae. albopictus</i> are absent or limited in distribution. The implication of a number of species of
