         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Over the past centuries, land systems in Italy experienced fundamental shifts, owing
            to the availability of new energy forms, population surges, and technological progress.
            The 20th century was characterized by massive productivity increases, accompanied
            by gradual land abandonment and the return of forest land. We here analyze 120 years
            of land system change in Italy, applying the human appropriation of net primary production
            (HANPP) framework, a metric for socio-economic pressures on terrestrial ecosystems.
            HANPP allows integrating ecological with societal perspectives, by systematically
            quantifying (a) biomass harvest and (b) the difference between potential productivity
            of ecosystems and current productivity induced by land use processes, such as land
            conversion, or land degradation. Besides assessing national trends we calculated HANPP
            separately for the Italian North and South between 1934 and 2007, in order to scrutinize
            if high regional discrepancies in terms of natural and socio-economic preconditions
            translate into diverging land system trajectories. Our results show that national
            HANPP has been declining from 78% of natural productivity before WWII to 56% in 2007,
            indicating a declining land -use induced pressure on biomass flows over time. Simultaneously,
            biomass harvest increased by around 26% due to agricultural intensification, despite
            shrinking croplands. Although we found a significant difference between the Northern
            and Southern region in the absolute levels of several land use indicators related
            to biomass appropriation, the overarching trends of land system change were remarkably
            similar in both regions. This suggests that underlying drivers of land system change,
            such as policies aimed at land-use intensification and structural change were equally
            dominating land system trajectories in the North and South of Italy, not withstanding
            their socio-ecological divergences.

            to accelerating biomass demand of a rising and prospering world population (

            shifts, demographic change) and natural constraints and endowments (e.g. water availability,
            climate, soils) co-determine trajectories of land system change. Analysing how land
            systems have reacted to changing underlying drivers in the past has been highlighted
            as key to tackle these knowledge gaps and as a precondition for preparing for future

            these flows consistently to ecological biomass flows, i.e. net primary production
            (NPP). NPP is defined as the biomass produced annually through photosynthesis. It
            represents the trophic basis of almost all living organisms on earth and thus is a
            key parameter of ecosystem functioning (

            flows related to changing socio-economic determinants due to its unique history of
            repeated major political and economic shifts, encompassing a major energy transition,
            a shift from democracy to fascism, two world wars and the accession to the European
            Union. While until far into the 20th century the level of industrialization was low
            to moderate compared to northern European countries, Italy became one of the leading
            industrial players after WWII (

            </span>), entailing rapid industrialization and economic growth. Thus after 1950 the role
            of agriculture changed completely (

            </span>) along with structural change of the economy, technological advancement, market integration
            and the accession to the European Union, all of which are likely to have affected
            land system trajectories at different scales. Data availability allowed assessing
            land system changes for the Republic of Italy between 1884 and 2007.

            gradient in terms of biophysical and socio-economic conditions, which are expected
            to have affected land systems differently in the North compared to the South. Natural
            preconditions are more favourable for biomass production in the North, while the South
            is prone to lower annual precipitation rates (701 mm/year in the North versus 453 mm

            </span>). In addition land use was determined by entirely different socio-economic frameworks
            in both regions until far into the 20th century. Historically northern land use tended
            to be more dominated by market driven decisions of individual family farmers who aimed
            at optimizing economic returns of their lands, whereas in the South land tenure rights
            were more restrictive particularly until WWII, with a substantial share of the population
            being employed as day labourers on large land holdings which were cultivated under
            low land use intensity (

               </sup>
            </span>). As a consequence high North/South discrepancies in terms of the level of industrialization,
            structural change of agriculture and economic performance prevailed over the past
            decades and indeed have been persisting until today (

               </sup>
            </span>). Data availability allowed for separate HANPP and land system change calculation
            for North and South Italy between 1934 and 2007. In this period an ongoing process
            of concentration of biomass production away from marginal and poorer regions into
            the most fertile areas, best suited for productivity increases, has been witnessed
            across many European regions (

            </span>). To our knowledge no study has so far analyzed if these processes are also reflected
            in the regional land use trajectories in Italy, e.g. leading to a gradual shift of
            harvest and HANPP from the South into the North, accompanied by a trend towards land
            abandonment in the South and land use intensification and production increases in
            the North.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Hence the overarching goals of this study are twofold: (1) We aim to analyze land
            system dynamics after 1884 in a consistent time-series approach and to put these trajectories
            in relation to long term socio-economic change, such as industrialization, market
            integration, and energy transition in order to scrutinize the role of these drivers
            in a long term perspective. (2) We will test the hypothesis if the high natural and
            socio-economic discrepancies between the Italian North and South led to different
            land system trajectories since 1934. From this analysis we expect insights into the
            role of climatic and socio-economic determinants for dynamics and patterns of land
            use in Italy.

            Italian borders have changed slightly during this period, in particular after World
            War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII). However, in terms of the total territory, these

            The South consists of eight provinces (Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Puglia, Abruzzo,

               and socio-economic performance, a similar pressure on ecosystems is exerted by land
               use in both regions. Additionally, this pressure was decoupled at an almost identical

               contributed a higher share to total land cover than in the North. Permanent cropland,
               as a relatively extensive form of agriculture, naturally exhibits lower levels of
               HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> per unit of land. Still permanent cropland can be highly profitable in monetary terms,

               lead to a reduced HANPP per capita compared to the North. Interestingly North/South
               disparities in land use trends seem to play out particularly on the socio-economic
               dimension of HANPP. Namely NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">act</div> as well as HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> per land area and HANPP efficiency (HANPP

               observed (despite revealing similar trends). However, high levels of fertilizer and
               machinery use were necessary in the North to achieve such high productivity levels
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>g and h), whereas levels of external inputs were lower in the South. This implies
               that environmental pressures related to high land use intensity, which are not quantified
               in the HANPP framework (e.g. air-, groundwater and soil pollution), are probably more
               severe in the North.

               land system parameters, such as HANPP per capita, or Nitrogen use productivity, which
               indicates that one unit of HANPP

               frameworks and natural preconditions for land use did not translate into major differences

               and backward Italian South in contrast to a highly productive Italian North, similarities

               This is particularly true in the light of previous findings at the national scale,

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Industrialization and intensification of land use were the common determinants of
            land use change in Italy, with gradually decreasing significance of biomass production
            for the overall economic performance being at the heart of the post WWII land use
            trends. The similarity in trends and – to a lesser degree – also in levels between
            Italian's North and South suggests that strong drivers of land system change must
            have been overruling the harsh differences in biophysical and socio-economic framework
            conditions between the two regions. The intensification of land use was a “mega-driver”
            of land system change in both regions: increasing levels of fertilizer use and machinery
            employment, lead to similar trends towards land abandonment and forest transition.
            In addition, the structural economic change, which led to a decreasing significance
            of land-based production in terms of economic performance and growth, was overruling
            any regional socio-economic as well as biophysical particularity. This megatrend was
            prevailing in both regions at a surprising similarity.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Further analyses of the interplay between socio-economic and natural determinants
            of land system change are required to scrutinize the underlying mechanisms and dominant
            processes characterizing this megatrend. The HANPP perspective on the case of Italy
            illustrates that caveats are warranted towards oversimplified hypotheses on mechanisms
            and determinants of land-system trajectories. Integrated, consistent and comprehensive
            frameworks are required to deepen our understanding of the complexities related to
            trajectories of land use change, in order to provide the knowledge base for future,
            more sustainable land systems.
