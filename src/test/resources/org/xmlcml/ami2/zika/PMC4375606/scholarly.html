         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Over the past centuries, land systems in Italy experienced fundamental shifts, owing
            to the availability of new energy forms, population surges, and technological progress.
            The 20th century was characterized by massive productivity increases, accompanied
            by gradual land abandonment and the return of forest land. We here analyze 120 years
            of land system change in Italy, applying the human appropriation of net primary production
            (HANPP) framework, a metric for socio-economic pressures on terrestrial ecosystems.
            HANPP allows integrating ecological with societal perspectives, by systematically
            quantifying (a) biomass harvest and (b) the difference between potential productivity
            of ecosystems and current productivity induced by land use processes, such as land
            conversion, or land degradation. Besides assessing national trends we calculated HANPP
            separately for the Italian North and South between 1934 and 2007, in order to scrutinize
            if high regional discrepancies in terms of natural and socio-economic preconditions
            translate into diverging land system trajectories. Our results show that national
            HANPP has been declining from 78% of natural productivity before WWII to 56% in 2007,
            indicating a declining land -use induced pressure on biomass flows over time. Simultaneously,
            biomass harvest increased by around 26% due to agricultural intensification, despite
            shrinking croplands. Although we found a significant difference between the Northern
            and Southern region in the absolute levels of several land use indicators related
            to biomass appropriation, the overarching trends of land system change were remarkably
            similar in both regions. This suggests that underlying drivers of land system change,
            such as policies aimed at land-use intensification and structural change were equally
            dominating land system trajectories in the North and South of Italy, not withstanding
            their socio-ecological divergences.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Land use provides essential resources to society and at the same time is one of the
            most central factors for accelerating global environmental change, which increasingly
            jeopardizes human well-being (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0110">Foley et al., 2005</span>). This dilemma of land use is expected to intensify in the coming decades, owing
            to accelerating biomass demand of a rising and prospering world population (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0280 bib0155 bib0025">Nonhebel &amp; Kastner, 2011; Kastner et al., 2012; Bruinsma, 2003</span>). This calls for in depth analysis of the trade-offs between societal gains and ecological
            costs related to land use (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0350 bib0345 bib0110 bib0200 bib0120">Turner et al., 1977; Tilman, 1999; Foley et al., 2005; Lambin &amp; Geist, 2006; Galloway
               et al., 2008
            </span>). Satisfying increasing biomass demand while concurrently avoiding potential environmental
            pitfalls requires interdisciplinary understanding of the complex society-nature interactions
            that lead to specific land use patterns and their dynamics over time (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1290 bib1120 bib1355">Rindfuss et al., 2004; GLP, 2005; Turner et al., 2007</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Large knowledge gaps persist on how socio-economic processes (economic growth, political
            shifts, demographic change) and natural constraints and endowments (e.g. water availability,
            climate, soils) co-determine trajectories of land system change. Analysing how land
            systems have reacted to changing underlying drivers in the past has been highlighted
            as key to tackle these knowledge gaps and as a precondition for preparing for future
            land system changes (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0045">Dearing et al., 2010</span>). Long-term case studies have proven a powerful approach for scrutinizing the general
            principles of land system change (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0175 bib0190 bib0335 bib0050">Krausmann et al., 2013, 2012; Singh et al., 2013; DeFries et al., 2004</span>), particularly in terms of analysing effects of rapid change and megatrends such
            as urbanization or the increasing relevance of telecouplings in the land system (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0135 bib0330 bib0250">Hostert et al., 2011; Seto et al., 2012; Meyfroidt et al., 2013</span>). Historic studies on land use change are rare though, mainly due to a lack of data
            sets on land system dynamics and their underlying drivers (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0335">Singh et al., 2013</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We here present a long time series analysis of land system change in the Republic
            of Italy, employing the analytical framework “human appropriation of net primary production”
            (HANPP; 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0130 bib0075 bib0080">Haberl et al., 2007; Erb et al., 2009a,b</span>). This framework allows to comprehensively assess changes in land systems (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0360 bib0130 bib0075 bib0080 bib0275">Vitousek et al., 1997; Haberl et al., 2007; Erb et al., 2009a,b; Niedertscheider et
               al., 2012
            </span>), by discerning changes in the extent of land-use types, which is often associated
            with land cover change, and changes in the intensity of land use (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0205 bib0070 bib0195">Lambin &amp; Meyfroidt, 2010; Erb et al., 2013; Kuemmerle et al., 2013</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">HANPP quantifies socio-economic biomass flows, e.g. agricultural harvest, and relates
            these flows consistently to ecological biomass flows, i.e. net primary production
            (NPP). NPP is defined as the biomass produced annually through photosynthesis. It
            represents the trophic basis of almost all living organisms on earth and thus is a
            key parameter of ecosystem functioning (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0305">Roy et al., 2001</span>). A central feature of HANPP is its ability to refer directly either to human consumption
            patterns, or to the impacts of land use on natural systems, allowing to put land use
            change in a socio-economic (e.g. resource economic; 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0010">Alvarenga et al., 2013</span>), as well as an ecological perspective (e.g. land use impacts on biodiversity, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0055 bib0130">Dullinger et al., 2013; Haberl et al., 2007</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The Republic of Italy is an interesting country for quantifying changes in biomass
            flows related to changing socio-economic determinants due to its unique history of
            repeated major political and economic shifts, encompassing a major energy transition,
            a shift from democracy to fascism, two world wars and the accession to the European
            Union. While until far into the 20th century the level of industrialization was low
            to moderate compared to northern European countries, Italy became one of the leading
            industrial players after WWII (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0220 bib0225">Malanima, 2006a,b</span>), entailing rapid industrialization and economic growth. Thus after 1950 the role
            of agriculture changed completely (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0240">Malanima &amp; Zamagni, 2010</span>) along with structural change of the economy, technological advancement, market integration
            and the accession to the European Union, all of which are likely to have affected
            land system trajectories at different scales. Data availability allowed assessing
            land system changes for the Republic of Italy between 1884 and 2007.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A second interesting aspect about Italy as a study example is its pronounced North/South
            gradient in terms of biophysical and socio-economic conditions, which are expected
            to have affected land systems differently in the North compared to the South. Natural
            preconditions are more favourable for biomass production in the North, while the South
            is prone to lower annual precipitation rates (701 mm/year in the North versus 453 mm
            in the South in 2011, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0140">ISTAT, 2012</span>), high temperature peaks in the summer, and dry-land degradation (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0365">Zika &amp; Erb, 2009</span>). In addition land use was determined by entirely different socio-economic frameworks
            in both regions until far into the 20th century. Historically northern land use tended
            to be more dominated by market driven decisions of individual family farmers who aimed
            at optimizing economic returns of their lands, whereas in the South land tenure rights
            were more restrictive particularly until WWII, with a substantial share of the population
            being employed as day labourers on large land holdings which were cultivated under
            low land use intensity (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0295 bib0060 bib0265">Rossi-Doria, 1958; Dunnage, 2002; Del Monte &amp; Pennacchio, 2011</span>). As a consequence high North/South discrepancies in terms of the level of industrialization,
            structural change of agriculture and economic performance prevailed over the past
            decades and indeed have been persisting until today (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0035 bib0150">Daniele &amp; Malanima, 2007; ISTAT, 2013</span>). Data availability allowed for separate HANPP and land system change calculation
            for North and South Italy between 1934 and 2007. In this period an ongoing process
            of concentration of biomass production away from marginal and poorer regions into
            the most fertile areas, best suited for productivity increases, has been witnessed
            across many European regions (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0210">MacDonald et al., 2000</span>). To our knowledge no study has so far analyzed if these processes are also reflected
            in the regional land use trajectories in Italy, e.g. leading to a gradual shift of
            harvest and HANPP from the South into the North, accompanied by a trend towards land
            abandonment in the South and land use intensification and production increases in
            the North.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Hence the overarching goals of this study are twofold: (1) We aim to analyze land
            system dynamics after 1884 in a consistent time-series approach and to put these trajectories
            in relation to long term socio-economic change, such as industrialization, market
            integration, and energy transition in order to scrutinize the role of these drivers
            in a long term perspective. (2) We will test the hypothesis if the high natural and
            socio-economic discrepancies between the Italian North and South led to different
            land system trajectories since 1934. From this analysis we expect insights into the
            role of climatic and socio-economic determinants for dynamics and patterns of land
            use in Italy.

         <h2>Materials and methods</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The period studied reaches from 1884 to 2007 for the entire Italian territory and
            is determined by the availability of land use and agricultural harvest statistics.
            Italian borders have changed slightly during this period, in particular after World
            War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII). However, in terms of the total territory, these
            changes were minor and were thus ignored. Between 1934 and 2007, data availability
            allowed analyzing land system trajectories separately for the Italian North and South.
            The South consists of eight provinces (Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Puglia, Abruzzo,
            Molise, Sicily and Sardinia) and is often referred to as “Mezzogiorno”.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our analysis of Italian HANPP trajectories is based on a wide range of datasets, which
            are shortly described below. A detailed description of the materials and methods is
            further provided in the Supplementary Online Material (SI).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We follow the definition of HANPP by 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0130">Haberl et al. (2007)</span> as the sum of productivity losses due to land use and land cover change (HANPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">luc</div>) and biomass harvest (HANPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div>; 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0005">Fig. 1</span>). High HANPP levels entail lower shares of NPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">eco</div>, i.e. the share of biomass remaining in ecosystems after human land use, which is
            available for other food webs. Thus high HANPP indicates high pressure on ecosystems
            caused by human land use. NPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">act</div> refers to the current, e.g. “human managed” levels of productivity and consists of
            harvested NPP (HANPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div>) and remaining productivity (NPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">eco</div>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The ratio of HANPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> to HANPP is denoted as HANPP efficency; this metric illustrates the efficiency to
            which societies gain biomass resources out of their HANPP levels. High levels of HANPP
            efficiency imply that large fractions of the appropriated productivty directly enter
            the socio-economic system in the form of biomass harvest, and that smaller fractions
            are foregone in the course of land use. HANPP efficiency thus does not capture the
            level of HANPP or HANPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> as such, but rather demonstrates the composition of HANPP.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">HANPP as percentage of NPP
            <div tagxxx="sub">pot</div> represents an indicator of the degree of human dominition of ecosystems in terms

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0075 bib0080">Erb et al., 2009a,b</span>). Low levels imply that high fractions of the natural productivty are left in ecosystems
            after harvest, and that the degree of human disturbance from a HANPP perspective is
            generally low. HANPP per person (HANPP/cap/year) relates biomass appropriation to
            population numbers.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The HANPP calculation for Italy is based on the following five datasets:

                     <i>A consistent land use</i>/-
                     <i>land cover data set</i>: Data for the main land use classes (i.e. forest land, grassland, annual cropland
                     and permanent cropland) were derived from Italian national statistics (
                     <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0215 bib0145 bib0150">MAIC, 1885–1914; ISTAT, 1935–2008; ISTAT, 2013</span>) and supplemented with model assumptions if data was lacking or insufficient (refer
                     to SI text). For recent time periods, forest land in the statistics was much lower
                     than values given in the remote-sensing derived product CORINE (
                     <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0065">EEA, 2006</span>), an indication that secondary forests and other woodland has been under-reported
                     by the statistics (
                     <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0285">Piussi &amp; Pettenella, 2000</span>). In order to apply to the forest cover extent reported in CORINE 2006 (
                     <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0065">EEA, 2006</span>) we modelled secondary succession of forest land by assuming that a share of 37%
                     of the declining agricultural areas from 1965 onwards (e.g. the year in which agricultural
                     areas started to decline permanently) was forest land after 20 years. This share of
                     “secondary forest land” was added to the statistical data on forest land. The category
                     “other land” was introduced in order to account for land which was not reported by

                     e.g. “heterogeneous agricultural land”, “shrublands” and “emerging forest land”. For
                     annual croplands CORINE reported higher values than the national statistics in the

               areas decreased considerably, allowing for the regrowth of forests (increase from

               rise, contributing a share of less than 5% to the territory over time. Unused areas
               amounted around 5% to total territory extent. The reduction of agricultural areas
               was also compensated by an increase in other land (increase from 17 to 24% between

            <h3>Long term land system trajectories, 1884–2007</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">From 1884 to 2007 Italy's socio-economic system underwent major shifts, which had
               fundamental repercussions on the land system. Until WWII agricultural growth in terms
               of economic output was low (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0100">Federico &amp; Malanima, 2004</span>), although it still played a central role in the economy (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0240">Malanima &amp; Zamagni, 2010</span>). A rapid industrial transition and fast economic growth started only after WWII,
               allowing for massive surges in agricultural productivity within a few years, accompanied
               with a concentration of land use on the most productive areas (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0085">Falcucci et al., 2006</span>). Abandonment of cultivated land was in particular pronounced in the mountainous
               regions (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0085">Falcucci et al., 2006</span>), leading to a forest transition (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0245">Mather, 2001</span>) and declining HANPP levels until the end of the observed period. In the period before
               WWII, HANPP was stagnating at around 80% of NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">pot</div>, surpassed the 80% between 1955 and 1970, and declined to a level below 60% in 2007.
               HANPP in Italy is thus at or above the HANPP level in many other industrialized countries,
               e.g. the UK, Spain, Hungary, or the Czech Republic (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0170 bib0325 bib0270 bib0355">Krausmann et al., 2001; Kohlheb &amp; Krausmann, 2009; Schwarzlmuller, 2009; Musel, 2009;
                  Vačkář &amp; Orlitová, 2011
               </span>; refer also to 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0190">Krausmann et al., 2012</span>). Italian HANPP was chiefly dominated by the trajectories on cropland throughout
               time, and to a somewhat lesser extent by HANPP on grazing land. Yield increases on
               cropland allowed for a decoupling of levels of HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> and cropland extent. Due to returning forests on abandoned croplands, HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">luc</div> increased, which translated into declining HANPP levels particularly after WWII.
               In per capita terms, HANPP showed a steep decline by a factor 2 from 1884 to 2007.
               Simultaneously HANPP efficiency increased (rising HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> per unit of HANPP), while croplands contracted and HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> increased. Thus land system change in Italy followed the typical trend of industrialization
               of the land-use system in overall terms (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0190">Krausmann et al., 2012</span>).
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">By 1884 the Italian energy system was still primarily based on biomass as the main
               supplier of energy and labour (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0220 bib0225 bib0115">Malanima, 2006a,b; Gales et al., 2007</span>). Rural poverty was high and natural resources (e.g. coal) including land for biomass
               production were chronically scarce. Concurrently outputs per land area, e.g. cereal
               yields, were generally below European average (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0015 bib0230">Baade, 1952; Malanima, 2011</span>), highlighting the low level of agricultural intensification, e.g. in terms of Nitrogen
               use compared to other European regions, which were already in the middle of industrial
               transition (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0015">Baade, 1952</span>). Agriculture was still primarily subsistence based, (except for wheat production,
               see 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0090 bib0095">Federico, 2007a,b</span>) and market integration was generally low, particularly in the Southern provinces.
               This is reflected in the low levels of HANPP efficiency until 1890 (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0010">Fig. 2</span>d, dashed line), which is a result of low yields and large productivity losses (HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">luc</div>). This changed to some degree in the period preceding WWI, when HANPP efficiency
               started to increase, fuelled by surging actual productivity on cultivated land.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The fascist period, from 1922 until WWII, was marked by the paradigm of agricultural
               self-sufficiency (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0320">Schmidt, 1936</span>). Land policies promoted land reclamation programmes, milestones were e.g. the drainage
               of the Pontine marshes (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0165 bib0315">Kish, 1966; Schmidt, 1937</span>). However, according to the aggregate national picture cropland extent remained at
               a constant level in these years and contrary to what was desired by the fascist regime
               HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> increased only minor. Likewise HANPP as percentage of NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">pot</div> remained at a constant level in this period and HANPP efficiency even slightly declined,
               indicating no major advancements in agricultural technology, which otherwise would
               have led to increasing HANPP efficiency as a result of rising yields.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The land systems changed drastically after WWII, following pathways of rising land
               use intensity. In the 1950s and 1960s Italy's economy underwent a rapid transition
               towards a fossil based energy system (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0220 bib0225">Malanima, 2006a,b</span>) and gradually became one of the leading industrial players in Europe. As a consequence
               the role of agriculture changed fundamentally in these years. By 1970 the share of
               Italians employed in agriculture had shrunk from 60% in 1884 to 17% of the total work
               force (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0040">Daniele &amp; Malanima, 2009</span>) and the agricultural share to total GDP has shrunk to less than 10% (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0150">ISTAT, 2013</span>). Thus economic performance as well as energy supply were no longer depending on
               land use performance. Simultaneously access to artificial fertilizers and agricultural
               machinery was improving drastically in the post-war years (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>g and h), allowing for surging agricultural yields (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>e). Thus actual productivity on annual cropland increased at fast pace, as a result
               of increasing land use intensification. Surges in nitrogen inputs were even more drastic
               than increases of cropland harvest, leading to declining levels of Nitrogen productivity
               between 1950 and 2007 (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>k).
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In turn agriculture on remote and mountainous land became less profitable, gradually
               leading to abandonment of agriculture and to a polarization of biomass production
               (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0125 bib0005 bib0210 bib0030">Guidi &amp; Piussi, 1993; Alberti et al., 2011; MacDonald et al., 2000; Caraveli, 2000</span>). This led to a declining HANPP trend and increasing HANPP efficiency, which started
               in the mid-1960s and continued until the end of the period.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The decline of agricultural areas after WWII was particularly pronounced in Italy,
               because Italy holds a substantial share of mountainous land, which made adoption of
               new technologies (e.g. heavy machinery) difficult. Structural economic change increased
               the availability of more profitable income sources than agriculture provided, emphasizing
               urbanization (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0235">Malanima, 2005</span>) and further land abandonment. In turn this allowed for re-growing forest land particularly
               from the 1960s onwards (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0285">Piussi &amp; Pettenella, 2000</span>) and indeed the Italian forest transition was rather rapid in terms of area expansion
               and growing forest stock, also compared to other European countries (see 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0160">Kauppi et al., 2006</span>).
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">These trends continued to dominate land system trajectories until the mid-1980s, when
               growth of HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> in absolute terms and per m
               <sup>2</sup> of land started to stagnate, and the increase in HANPP efficiency came to a halt.
               Particularly pronounced are reductions in the amount of grazed biomass, which is attributed
               to declining animal stocks and intensification of the livestock system (also refer
               to 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>f), characterized by an increasing importance of market feed as a source of animal
               fodder and growing independency from grasslands. EU-policies, which were formerly
               production based, and thus favoured a shift towards high intensity farming started
               to promote more extensive forms of agriculture by the late 1980s and particularly
               in the early 1990s (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0030">Caraveli, 2000</span>). However, actual productivity per land unit in overall terms continued to rise as
               a result of further expansion of forests, characterized by high NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">act</div> values, on abandoned land (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0015">Fig. 3</span>a and b), and increasing yields on croplands, particularly in the North (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>e).

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">These improvements in terms of HANPP, however, cannot be straightforwardly interpreted
               as a development towards more sustainable land systems from a global perspective.
               HANPP accounts only focus on developments on a defined territory unit, but do not
               allow to depict trajectories in resource use of a population. Analyzing Italian net
               biomass trade (Fig. 1, SI) reveals that declining levels of HANPP from 1884 to 2007
               have been offset by imports: Net imports of biomass increased more than 10-fold from
               1934 to 2007, illustrating that land use impacts were increasingly externalized to
               other world regions. This is a much faster growth than the increase in population
               numbers, which increased 1.5-fold in the same time period (

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The analysis of land system change in the North and South of Italy revealed striking
               similarities between the regional pictures. Most prominently, HANPP trajectories,
               either in relation to natural productivity or to population growth (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>a and b), are remarkably similar, both in level and trend. HANPP in both regions declined
               from around 80% to a value of somewhat below 60% of NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">pot</div> from 1934 to 2007. This indicates that, despite all the differences in natural endowment
               and socio-economic performance, a similar pressure on ecosystems is exerted by land
               use in both regions. Additionally, this pressure was decoupled at an almost identical
               pace from population growth in each region.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Also the general pattern of land use/-cover change is similar for the North and South
               of Italy, most notably encompassing a concentration of agriculture on the most fertile
               areas over time, in favour of forest re-growth. Biomass production was rising in both
               regions, as well as NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">act</div> per m
               <sup>2</sup> and HANPP efficiency (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>c, j, d and e). Likewise both regions were marked by slight decreases of HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> per m
               <sup>2</sup> by the late 1980s, indicating similar responses to a shift in EU-land policies, which
               started to subsidize set aside programmes and more extensive forms of agriculture
               in these years. This is also reflected in declining growth rates of Nitrogen inputs
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>g).

               and relative levels of several indicators differed between both regions. In the North,
               volumes of HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> were much larger (116 gC/m
               <sup>2</sup> compared to 98 gC/m
               <sup>2</sup>/year in the South in 2007), and productivity losses as the second part of HANPP were
               smaller over the entire time period considered. Here NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">act</div> levels even surpassed their natural potential (NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">pot</div>) on annual croplands from the late 1980s onwards, as it is indicated by negative
               values of HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">luc</div> (not shown here), while Southern NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">act</div> remained well below its natural potential. Level differences of NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">act</div> in the Italian North and South can be attributed to the combined effects of contrasting
               biophysical conditions and effects of socio-economic legacies. Over the previous decades
               and centuries both regions developed distinct ways of land use for biomass production.
               Although a mix of different land- and agricultural systems co-existed in both regions

               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0020">Bertolini et al., 2008</span>), lacking agricultural investment, and restrictive land tenure rights (e.g. high
               share of landless day labourers) far into the second half of the 20th century. This
               led to the emergence of extensive, low input forms of agriculture over large parts
               in the South, while the share of highly productive areas (olive, fruit and wine cultivation),
               was restricted mainly to some coastal zones (

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In the North, land tenure rights improved in the 19th century and agriculture became
               more closely connected to industry which granted access to capital inputs such as
               Nitrogen and machinery. This led to a tendency towards a more intensive and more profitable
               biomass production system than it was the case in the South (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0060 bib0265">Dunnage, 2002; Del Monte &amp; Pennacchio, 2011</span>). Particularly the Po valley has been one of the most advanced agricultural regions
               in Europe already in the 19th century. Here large scale land reclamation schemes and
               irrigation systems have been introduced much earlier than in the Southern regions
               (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0315">Schmidt, 1937</span>).

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In Southern Italy, large land holders did not follow this intensification trend, and
               relied much more on a traditional workforce organization, which may partly explain
               the level differences of some HANPP indicators. Even after WWII, when Southern agro-economic
               development was made a national issue (an example is the foundation of the national
               programme “cassa per il Mezzogiorno”, aimed primarily at financing public construction
               works, and promoting economic investment) and land tenure rights were completely reformed
               in the course of a major land reform (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0300">Rother et al., 2000</span>), the economic gap has been described to even have widened (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0105 bib0035">Felice, 2009; Daniele &amp; Malanima, 2007</span>). This is also supported by the results of HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> on cropland and agricultural labour productivity after WWII, revealing faster acceleration
               of the trends in the North (

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">There are many views of why the North performed better in terms of (agro-) economic
               productivity than the South. One view is that climate, soils and topography made investment
               into the land more risky in the South, where land owners had to deal with hot growing
               seasons, repeating drought events and harvest failures (Petruscewitz cited in 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0090 bib0095">Federico, 2007a,b</span>). Basically, the South faces a larger precipitation deficit than the North which
               is mirrored both in the LPJ-model outputs (NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">pot</div> was 25% lower in the South than in the North, refer to Fig. 2, SI) and actual productivity.
               In addition, human induced soil degradation is a problem particularly for the South
               (

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Differences in biophysical conditions also influence decisions on plant species grown
               and cropping techniques applied, which might explain the differences in the level
               of many HANPP variables (NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">act</div>/m
               <sup>2</sup>, HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div>/m

               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div>/m
               <sup>2</sup> and HANPP efficiency) to some extent. For instance, permanent cropland in the South
               contributed a higher share to total land cover than in the North. Permanent cropland,
               as a relatively extensive form of agriculture, naturally exhibits lower levels of
               HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> per unit of land. Still permanent cropland can be highly profitable in monetary terms,
               and these examples also existed in the South (Rossi Doria cited in 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0090 bib0095">Federico, 2007a,b</span>).

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Nevertheless, the bio-climatically disadvantageous situation of the South did not
               lead to a reduced HANPP per capita compared to the North. Interestingly North/South
               disparities in land use trends seem to play out particularly on the socio-economic
               dimension of HANPP. Namely NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">act</div> as well as HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> per land area and HANPP efficiency (HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> as % of HANPP) (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span> c, d, e and j) were at higher levels in the North throughout the entire time period
               observed (despite revealing similar trends). However, high levels of fertilizer and
               machinery use were necessary in the North to achieve such high productivity levels
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="fig0020">Fig. 4</span>g and h), whereas levels of external inputs were lower in the South. This implies
               that environmental pressures related to high land use intensity, which are not quantified
               in the HANPP framework (e.g. air-, groundwater and soil pollution), are probably more
               severe in the North.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">On the other hand almost no differences remain when the difference in potential productivity
               are taken into account. HANPP expressed in percent of NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">pot</div> is nearly identical in both regions, indicating a very similar degree of human disturbance
               or level of land use related pressures on ecosystems. The same was true for other
               land system parameters, such as HANPP per capita, or Nitrogen use productivity, which
               indicates that one unit of HANPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">harv</div> consumed similar amounts of Nitrogen (

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our study revealed that, contrary to what we have expected, the differences in socio-economic
               frameworks and natural preconditions for land use did not translate into major differences
               in the land system trajectories. Given the wide-spread notion of a low productive
               and backward Italian South in contrast to a highly productive Italian North, similarities
               in the overall patterns of land system change observed in this study were rather surprising.
               This is particularly true in the light of previous findings at the national scale,
               for instance Spain (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0325">Schwarzlmuller, 2009</span>) and Great Britain (

               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="bib0190">Krausmann et al., 2012</span>) where considerable differences in terms of the levels of HANPP % NPP
               <div tagxxx="sub">pot</div> between Northern and Southern countries are found. This indicates that, related to
               the development of land use over time, the common history of political developments
               and land use policies were apparently strong enough to compensate for the regional
               differences and particularities between the North and South.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Industrialization and intensification of land use were the common determinants of
            land use change in Italy, with gradually decreasing significance of biomass production
            for the overall economic performance being at the heart of the post WWII land use
            trends. The similarity in trends and – to a lesser degree – also in levels between
            Italian's North and South suggests that strong drivers of land system change must
            have been overruling the harsh differences in biophysical and socio-economic framework
            conditions between the two regions. The intensification of land use was a “mega-driver”
            of land system change in both regions: increasing levels of fertilizer use and machinery
            employment, lead to similar trends towards land abandonment and forest transition.
            In addition, the structural economic change, which led to a decreasing significance
            of land-based production in terms of economic performance and growth, was overruling
            any regional socio-economic as well as biophysical particularity. This megatrend was
            prevailing in both regions at a surprising similarity.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Further analyses of the interplay between socio-economic and natural determinants
            of land system change are required to scrutinize the underlying mechanisms and dominant
            processes characterizing this megatrend. The HANPP perspective on the case of Italy
            illustrates that caveats are warranted towards oversimplified hypotheses on mechanisms
            and determinants of land-system trajectories. Integrated, consistent and comprehensive
            frameworks are required to deepen our understanding of the complexities related to
            trajectories of land use change, in order to provide the knowledge base for future,
            more sustainable land systems.
