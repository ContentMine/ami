         <h2>Abstract</h2>
         <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Across the globe, the emergence of complex societies excites intense academic debate
            in archaeology and allied disciplines. Not surprisingly, in southern Africa the traditional
            assumption that the evolution of socio-political complexity began with ideological
            transformations from K2 to Mapungubwe between CE1200 and 1220 is clouded in controversy.
            It is believed that the K2−Mapungubwe transitions crystallised class distinction and
            sacred leadership, thought to be the key elements of the Zimbabwe culture on Mapungubwe
            Hill long before they emerged anywhere else. From Mapungubwe (CE1220–1290), the Zimbabwe
            culture was expressed at Great Zimbabwe (CE1300–1450) and eventually Khami (CE1450–1820).
            However, new fieldwork at Mapela Hill, when coupled with a Bayesian chronology, offers
            tremendous fresh insights which refute this orthodoxy. Firstly, Mapela possesses enormous
            prestige stone-walled terraces whose initial construction date from the 11
            <sup>th</sup> century CE, almost two hundred years earlier than Mapungubwe. Secondly, the basal
            levels of the Mapela terraces and hilltop contain élite solid 
            <i>dhaka</i> (adobe) floors associated with K2 pottery and glass beads. Thirdly, with a hilltop
            and flat area occupation since the 11
            <sup>th</sup> century CE, Mapela exhibits evidence of class distinction and sacred leadership earlier
            than K2 and Mapungubwe, the supposed propagators of the Zimbabwe culture. Fourthly,
            Mapungubwe material culture only appeared later in the Mapela sequence and therefore
            post-dates the earliest appearance of stone walling and 
            <i>dhaka</i> floors at the site. Since stone walls, 
            <i>dhaka</i> floors and class distinction are the essence of the Zimbabwe culture, their earlier
            appearance at Mapela suggests that Mapungubwe can no longer be regarded as the sole
            cradle of the Zimbabwe culture. This demands not just fresh ways of accounting for
            the rise of socio-political complexity in southern Africa, but also significant adjustments
            to existing models.

            beads and ceramics from Leopard's Kopje sites and those of Periods II and III at Great
            Zimbabwe, little attention was paid to the possibility that the Zimbabwe culture evolved
            out of the Leopards' Kopje and was therefore more important than was acknowledged
            at the time. Great Zimbabwe was considered to be the capital of a very extensive empire
            stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Kalahari. The hundreds of differently-sized
            dry stone-walled settlements were accorded the status of provincial, district and
            ward centres in the super state. As a result, an opportunity to unravel the contribution

            define the Zimbabwe culture. Geographically, Mapela possesses all the advantages which
            K2 and Mapungubwe have, and perhaps a lot more. It is situated in rich elephant hunting
            country close to perennial water sources and is within 20 kilometres of the strategic
            Gwanda-West-Nicholson gold belt. The fieldwork mapped and excavated the site to establish
            its spatial extent and the density of stone walling, as well as collecting samples
            for dating. The results indicated that Mapela is easily the largest known Leopard's
            Kopje site in southern Africa. The Bayesian chronology, when combined with local pottery
            and glass bead typologies, suggests that Mapela flourished between CE1055 and CE1400
            and therefore pre- and post-dates the generally accepted dates for the flourishing
            of Mapungubwe (CE1220–1300). Furthermore, it contained prestige stone walls and evidence
            of class distinction, which suggest that the Zimbabwe culture was expressed earlier
            at Mapela than at K2 and Mapungubwe. Finally, a polycentric model informed by Actor
            Network theory, historical data, material culture patterning and modelled Bayesian
            dates was developed.

               stone walling is a characteristic feature of Leopard's Kopje sites, the size and extent
               of the terraces of Mapela was not approached elsewhere in the region. Therefore, the
               stone walls of Mapela, according to Garlake, were only dwarfed by those of later sites
               such as Great Zimbabwe, Khami and others, typical of the flowering of the Zimbabwe
               culture. Two radiocarbon dates, SR122 and SR115, were obtained from charcoal. However,
               because of the high error term, the dates are uncertain and when calibrated at 2 sigma,
               yield a date of between CE1050 and 1400. Nevertheless, they indicate that Mapela was

               their never having visited the site, to believe that Mapela was smaller than Mapungubwe.
               Unfortunately, Garlake did not include the massive terraces on different contours
               of the hill below the summit. Despite this omission, Garlake concluded that Mapela

               he noted the presence of class distinction and surmised that further excavation of

               that began with pedestrian surveys, followed by a combination of field and desktop

               <h3>a. Surveying</h3>
               <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A dedicated pedestrian survey was conducted across the entire site. In the process,
                  extensive terraces (
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111224-g004">Figure 4</span>), vitrified dung and middens with a mix of fauna, pottery, metal objects and occasional
                  glass and shell beads were recorded on the flats, terraces and hilltop. On both the
                  terraces and hilltop, erosion often exposed a succession of fired 
                  <i>dhaka</i> or Zimbabwe cement floors (
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111224-g005">Figure 5</span>). Surprisingly, for a stone-walled Leopard's Kopje site, vitrified dung was recorded
                  on numerous terraces and flats pointing to the presence of kraals on and below the
                  hill. It has been argued that with the advent of the Zimbabwe culture, cattle kraals
                  were sited away from residential areas (7) but Mapela clearly contradicts such thinking.
                  Surface pottery comprised a mixture of K2 (
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111224-g006">Figure 6</span>) and Mapungubwe ceramics, with occasional Zhizo sherds. On the western side, the
                  main hill narrows into a smaller kopje which is conjoined to the site of Little Mapela.
                  When these observations are reconciled with Garlake's (17) report, it becomes immediately
                  obvious that only the summit of the main hill was mapped, thereby excluding approximately
                  three quarters of the site. Unfortunately, this underestimation of Mapela's size has
                  given it a subordinate role to Mapungubwe, when the opposite is true if settlement
                  size is the only variable that determines political importance.

                  Gauteng in South Africa. To begin with, Garlake's map of the summit was superimposed
                  on a Google Earth image of Mapela Hill to establish control points. Once the best-fitting
                  overlay was established, the terraces and other prominent features were screen digitised
                  using GIS software. In cases where opacity was poor, field walking and geocoded GPS
                  recording enabled the capturing of accurate details. Such an endeavour, for the first
                  time, finally produced a complete map of Mapela Hill (

                  Hill is just over 90 metres high. Apparently, most contours of the hill were heavily
                  terraced indicating that the site was intensively occupied. Furthermore, if the map
                  of the summit is considered in relation to the whole site, it becomes decisively clear
                  that Garlake's descriptions – and all subsequent interpretations based on it – severely

                  place in different areas of the site – the flats, the terraces and the summit. Such
                  a strategy allowed us to explore the issue of class distinction at the site. Terrace
                  Excavation Trench 1 was located on the eastern edge of a sloping terrace covered by
                  vitrified dung (

                  by two successive middens, one brownish and another greyish in colour. Underneath
                  this was a layer of vitrified dung, followed by another 
                  <i>dhaka</i> floor which rested on top of a brown fill with midden debris. The fired nature of
                  the floor ruled out other alternatives, such as caps which may result from repeated
                  cattle or animal hoof stamping (see Huffman,

                  and 
                  <i>dhaka</i> in level 11. A very thick 
                  <i>dhaka</i> floor followed underneath (level 12). It was succeeded by yet another event associated
                  with burning. A mixture of wood charcoal, grass and sorghum seeds was recovered in
                  this level 13. The recovery of sorghum seeds suggests that the circular stone feature
                  that continued from the layer above, on the northern side of the trench, was a grain
                  bin foundation. Below this was another floor underlaid by a layer comprising of broken
                  
                  <i>dhaka</i> fragments, pottery and charcoal. This was followed by a midden which accumulated
                  on top of a floor, and covered one side of the trench. The southern corner of the
                  trench contained charcoal, ash and burnt 
                  <i>dhaka</i> in level 16. It seems that this material collected on top of a floor (levels 17 and
                  18) which sealed a very thin midden that contained K2 pottery, charcoal and three
                  glass beads (levels 18 and 19). Because of the depth and integrity of this stratigraphy,
                  nine samples of carbonaceous materials from levels 7, 9, and 13 to 19 were submitted
                  for radiocarbon dating.

                  was encountered. A decision was made to extend the trench by one metre (Extension

                  useful insights for building ceramic and bead sequences on the terrace. The ceramics
                  were analysed using the standard typological technique of considering vessel shape,

                  in the intermediate layers. Mapungubwe (Late Leopard's Kopje/Early Zimbabwe culture)
                  ceramics became more frequent from the middle to upper layers of the sequence (see
                  
                  <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111224-g011">Figure 11</span> for selected illustrations). The same pattern was also mirrored in Lower Summit Excavation
                  Trench 1 where the bottom layers were dominated by K2 pottery, followed by transitional
                  and Mapungubwe pottery. Occasional Zhizo ceramics were recovered in all excavation
                  areas but more work is required to interpret the implications of this association.
                  Therefore, the ceramic sequence at Mapela consists of all the major pottery phases
                  associated with socio-political complexity in the Middle Limpopo Valley – Zhizo, K2,
                  Transitional K2 and Mapungubwe.

                  value of the data X, to the posterior distribution, through Bayes' law. Inference
                  about Ø is then extracted from this posterior. The prior is a formal statement of
                  what is known before the process of data collection, while the posterior is the desired
                  outcome. Bayes' theorem relates posterior likelihood X to the prior. Based on the

            represents the first expression of Zimbabwe culture is so entrenched that it has become
            accepted lore. And yet recent archaeological work at Mapela has generated insights
            fundamental for re-envisioning our understanding of the evolution of socio-political
            complexity in southern Africa. The archaeological work at Mapela decisively reveals
            that Garlake's description of the site greatly underestimated its size and importance.
            Crucially, Mapela has K2, Transitional K2 and Mapungubwe ceramics and glass beads
            in stratified and uninterrupted contexts. The Bayesian chronology dates the earliest
            occupation of the excavated terrace to the 11
            <sup>th</sup> century CE, right at the onset of the K2 period (see 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0111224-Meyer1">
               <sup>

               </sup>
            </span>). By the mid-11
            <sup>th</sup> century CE, K2 people built houses with solid 
            <i>dhaka</i> floors on massive stone-walled terraces, a tradition which continued into the Mapungubwe
            period. An eroded section on the northern edge of the summit shows a sequence of floors
            from bedrock up to the top of the sequence. As we have seen, the basal layers contain
            K2 followed by Transitional K2 material. This conclusion is further strengthened by
            the evidence from Terrace Excavation Trench 1, where a sterile earthy fill underlies
            the earliest K2 occupation of the terrace on the eastern side of the trench. Triangulation
            by theodolite indicated that this level also represented the top of the terrace platform
            on the edge, as illustrated by

            and a flat area occupation consistent with social hierarchy and class distinction.
            Working on both cultural and chronological logic, the presence of Zimbabwe pattern
            dry stone walls, at Mapela shows that it was probably far more influential than the
            chronologically overlapping K2 (which did not have elements of the Zimbabwe culture).
            On the basis of precedence, Mapungubwe may have copied Mapela which, as we have seen,
            had a fully-evolved Zimbabwe culture before the Middle Limpopo sites. This evidence

            Leopard's Kopje people at K2 and Mapungubwe belonged to the same cultural group as
            the Leopard's Kopje people at Mapela and other places who shared a similar ideology,
            it can be authoritatively argued that the dry stone walls in south-western Zimbabwe
            and associated 
            <i>dhaka</i> structures represent the earliest Zimbabwe culture expression. Evidence from south-western
            Zimbabwe shows that everything that makes up the Zimbabwe culture at Mapungubwe appeared
            earlier at Mapela, making Mapela one of the most important sites with secure evidence

            </span>. The principle of building élite dwellings on terraces is demonstrated at Mapela
            during K2 times. In fact, the presence of abundant terraces constructed at different
            elevations further indicates the principle of ranking and class distinction at Mapela,
            with those on the lower terraces being of a lower class than those above them. The
            Lower Summit Excavation Trench 1 on the hilltop produced K2 pottery as well as Transitional
            K2 material in the basal levels, demonstrating an élite occupation of the hilltop
            from the outset. Fundamentally, Mapela also boasts of an occupation of the surrounding
            flats by people making initially K2, and later Mapungubwe ceramics, which confirms
            that class and social differentiation had been established by the 11
            <sup>th</sup> century CE. Mapungubwe therefore exhibits cultural practices that were already on
            the landscape, showing continuity in tradition through interaction, copying, and other

            <sup>th</sup> century CE, rainmaking took place in the natural environment, away from homesteads.
            However, this practice changed during the Transitional K2 period when certain individuals
            appropriated rainmaking control on Mapungubwe Hill and used it as springboard to political
            power. The signature of rainmaking includes steep-sided hills difficult to access,
            as well as infrastructure such as rock tanks and artificial cupules. Huffman

            as part of the ritual process linked with rainmaking. Mapela possesses this signature
            of rainmaking in abundance. At 90 metres high and with very sheer cliffs, Mapela is
            steep sided and difficult to access, taking on average at least an hour to get to
            the summit. Furthermore, it contains rock tanks and cupules at various levels, from
            the hilltop to the lower terraces (

            While the Mapungubwe hilltop is elongated with only one terrace platform (

            Mapela Hill is heavily terraced along most of its contours, Mapungubwe is not. The
            enormous size of the walls at Mapela (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0111224-g004">Figure 4</span>), and the labour evidently invested in constructing terraces, far exceeds that reported
            for the Leopard's Kopje sites in southern Africa. On the basis of this new data, it
            is undeniable that southern African archaeologists relied too much on Garlake's account
            without visiting the site themselves. The result was that Mapela was made to suit
            different explanatory frameworks while using erroneous assumptions.

            Phase I period, and that during the same time, various Shona people resident in southern
            Zambezia participated in long-distance trade, in local trade , and developed a number
            of cultural attributes visible on the whole landscape. With time, these communities
            started to build very elaborate dry stone-walled palaces epitomised early on by Malumba,
            Mapela, Halisupi and Mapungubwe, and later by the grand capitals such as Tsindi, Great
            Zimbabwe and Khami. Even during this early period, many actors were at play on this
            landscape, which explains the hundreds of Leopard's Kopje-, Great Zimbabwe- and Khami-type

            polity, such as Ur. Instead, the evidence shows the presence of multiple communities
            at places like Uruk, with more or less identical attributes to those of Ur and others.
            Similarly, the various Aegean polities were interacting with one another through trade

            today, a view which is consistent with the many Leopard's Kopje polities (if one may
            call them that) in our region from CE900 onwards. The emphasis in these parts of the
            world is not on finding the earliest city state of Sumer, neither is it on finding
            the earliest Mayan city state, for to do so would be pointlessly investing energy
            in finding the first grain of sand to be deposited in an ocean. Rather, the focus
            is on combining evidence to understand how various polities or actors may have interacted,
            resulting in continuity and change. If such an approach is adopted in southern Africa,
            it may be possible to learn more about the dynamism of the Leopard's Kopje and its
            apogee, the Zimbabwe culture.

            an important space in debates on early state formation in southern Africa. Fundamentally,
            the ceramics, glass beads, chronometric and architectural evidence suggest that Mapela
            had fully developed attributes of the Zimbabwe culture during K2 times. Furthermore,
            the ideology of class distinction and sacred leadership at Mapela antedates that at
            K2 and Mapungubwe. On this evidence neither K2 nor Mapungubwe qualify to be the region's
            incipient Zimbabwe culture centres. Of course Mapungubwe has yielded an impressive
            array of gold objects which are yet to be found at Mapela. However, on the basis of
            cultural precedence, Mapela had a fully developed Zimbabwe culture much earlier than
            Mapungubwe. The thousands of glass beads found at Mapela show that it was a principal
            player in long-distance trade. Mapela has also been shown to be considerably larger
            than Mapungubwe. Therefore, it would be unreasonable to conclude that a later site
            with far fewer dry stone walls is more important than one with more, if both the sites
            are within the formation of the Zimbabwe culture period.

            as peer polity interaction, suggests that towards the early second millennium CE,
            various Shona communities resident in the region bound by the Indian Ocean to the
            east and the Kalahari to the north underwent a series of transformations ideologically,
            culturally, economically and politically. The seeds of these transformations were
            sowed during the Leopard's Kopje Phase I and were elaborated during the Zimbabwe culture
            period. The presence of various actors exposes markedly the undesirability of models
            which fix the birth of early state formation at single points in time. It is far more
            prudent to argue that various communities exhibiting identical cultural practices
            all contributed and participated in early state formation. As such, early state formation
            did not start at Mapungubwe; neither did it start at Great Zimbabwe or Khami. Instead,
            it started with the many Leopard's Kopje sites which show evidence of the expression
            of Zimbabwe culture in south-western Zimbabwe and adjacent regions. The thinking that
            the evolution of the Zimbabwe culture started at Mapungubwe through Great Zimbabwe
            to Khami must now surely be revised. This is because as elsewhere, it is impossible
            to pinpoint the start of an innovation which is widely expressed across a vast stretch
            of land by using only a few sites. Certainly the Zimbabwe culture started with the
            Leopard's Kopje, which evolved into the Zimbabwe, but the mechanisms of such continuity
            and change are unknown. Huffman (

            and sites in south-western Zimbabwe and north-eastern Botswana has not been fully
            considered. We have presented chronological and material culture evidence from one
            site in that area, which indicates that the Zimbabwe culture crystallised during K2
            times, making it unlikely that Mapungubwe is the first Zimbabwe culture capital, as
            has been generally assumed until now. The evolution of early state formation in our
            region followed multiple trajectories mediated by context-specific situations. In
            the process, some communities failed where others succeeded, with reversals taking
            place at different intervals. The net sum is that there are hundreds of widely separated
            and chronologically overlapping actors belonging to the Leopard's Kopje and Zimbabwe
            cultures. The major lesson for global archaeology is that from time to time it is
            absolutely critical to update our knowledge of any given area through continuous fieldwork
            and new questions. Indeed, some archaeological truths started as opinions which were
            not verified on the ground, but were then repeated widely thereby becoming ‘truths’.
            These truths must be tempered with new information and insights to create more dynamic
            pasts.
