         island states – depend on an ambitious outcome at the 21st Conference of the Parties
         to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (Paris, 30 November
         to 11 December 2015). Unless the world dramatically reduces emissions of greenhouse
         gases, especially carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels, it is estimated that
         global average temperature will increase by 2.6–4.8 °C and sea level will rise by
         up to a metre around the end of this century.
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">
            <sup>1</sup>
         </span> These changes would have major health impacts.

      <p xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">By the 2030s – now less than 15 years away – approximately 250 000 additional deaths
         are projected to occur every year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress
         attributable to climate change.
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">
            <sup>2</sup>
         </span> Climate change will disproportionally affect small island states, because of their
         relatively small land area, high population density and dependence on local ecosystems
         for subsistence. Rising sea levels threaten to make low-lying island nations such
         as Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu uninhabitable. Understandably, Pacific
         island leaders have called for increases in global average temperatures to be limited
         to less than 1.5 °C.

         infectious diseases and climate change impacts. In some Pacific island states, mortality
         rates from noncommunicable diseases are already among the highest in the world. Since
         2012, there have been over 40 large infectious disease outbreaks in the region: most
         were caused by climate-sensitive diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus
         infections.
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">
            <sup>4</sup>
         </span> There have also been several record-breaking extreme climate events in the Pacific
         recently. Extreme events often damage or destroy health facilities, disrupting essential
         health services when they are needed most urgently. For example, in Vanuatu, cyclone
         Pam seriously damaged many health facilities: two hospitals, 19 health centres and
         50 dispensaries in 22 affected islands. In the most affected province, 21 of 24 health
         facilities were damaged. The economic impact was estimated to be more than 60% loss
         of gross domestic product.

         other stakeholders of Pacific island countries to build climate resilient health systems.
         Although a disease-specific approach is useful initially, in the long run a comprehensive
         intersectoral programme is required. As recommended by WHO,
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">
            <sup>6</sup>
         </span> this programme should address (i) health governance and policies tackling climate
         risks; (ii) health information, integrated surveillance and climate early warning
         systems; and (iii) preventive and curative services (water and sanitation, pest and
         vector control, food safety, disaster risk management for health, safe and environmentally
         sustainable health facilities, vaccination and child health services).

         national climate change and health vulnerability and impact assessments to guide health
         system adaptation plans. These assessments highlighted common climate risks such as
         direct impacts of extreme weather events (e.g. drowning and injuries), waterborne
         and vector-borne diseases.
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">
            <sup>8</sup>
         </span> In Fiji, where a recent outbreak of dengue fever affected over 20 000 people, dengue,
         leptospirosis, typhoid fever and diarrhoea were targeted as priority climate-sensitive
         diseases.
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">
            <sup>9</sup>
         </span> Fiji has produced a strategic action plan for climate change and health for 2016–2020,
         including the development of early warning and response in vulnerable communities.
         However, as for other small island developing states, implementation will be a huge
         challenge. The health sector has received less than 1.5% of the multilateral funds
         for climate change adaptation distributed to date.
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">

         health. For the first time, international commitments for reductions in carbon dioxide
         emissions, if fully implemented, would have a meaningful impact on global temperature
         rise.
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">
            <sup>11</sup>
         </span> The Paris climate pact, if sufficiently ambitious and effective, would be considered
         not only a major turning point in climate change policy, but also a far-reaching public
         health treaty to protect and promote the health and well-being of vulnerable populations,
         particularly those of small island states.
