         island states – depend on an ambitious outcome at the 21st Conference of the Parties
         to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (Paris, 30 November
         to 11 December 2015). Unless the world dramatically reduces emissions of greenhouse
         gases, especially carbon dioxide from burning of fossil fuels, it is estimated that
         global average temperature will increase by 2.6–4.8 °C and sea level will rise by
         up to a metre around the end of this century.

         are projected to occur every year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress
         attributable to climate change.

         </span> Climate change will disproportionally affect small island states, because of their
         relatively small land area, high population density and dependence on local ecosystems
         for subsistence. Rising sea levels threaten to make low-lying island nations such
         as Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu uninhabitable. Understandably, Pacific
         island leaders have called for increases in global average temperatures to be limited
         to less than 1.5 °C.

         infectious diseases and climate change impacts. In some Pacific island states, mortality
         rates from noncommunicable diseases are already among the highest in the world. Since
         2012, there have been over 40 large infectious disease outbreaks in the region: most
         were caused by climate-sensitive diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus
         infections.

         </span> There have also been several record-breaking extreme climate events in the Pacific
         recently. Extreme events often damage or destroy health facilities, disrupting essential
         health services when they are needed most urgently. For example, in Vanuatu, cyclone
         Pam seriously damaged many health facilities: two hospitals, 19 health centres and
         50 dispensaries in 22 affected islands. In the most affected province, 21 of 24 health
         facilities were damaged. The economic impact was estimated to be more than 60% loss
         of gross domestic product.

         Although a disease-specific approach is useful initially, in the long run a comprehensive
         intersectoral programme is required. As recommended by WHO,

         national climate change and health vulnerability and impact assessments to guide health
         system adaptation plans. These assessments highlighted common climate risks such as
         direct impacts of extreme weather events (e.g. drowning and injuries), waterborne
         and vector-borne diseases.

         including the development of early warning and response in vulnerable communities.
         However, as for other small island developing states, implementation will be a huge
         challenge. The health sector has received less than 1.5% of the multilateral funds
         for climate change adaptation distributed to date.
