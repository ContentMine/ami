         <p>After taking vertebrate blood, female mosquitoes quickly shed excess water and ions
            while retaining and concentrating the mostly proteinaceous nutrients. Aquaporins (AQPs)
            are an evolutionary conserved family of membrane transporter proteins that regulate
            the flow of water and in some cases glycerol and other small molecules across cellular
            membranes. In a previous study, we found six putative AQP genes in the genome of the
            yellow fever mosquito, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, and demonstrated the involvement of three of them in the blood meal-induced diuresis.
            Here we characterized AQP expression in different tissues before and after a blood
            meal, explored the substrate specificity of AQPs expressed in the Malpighian tubules
            and performed RNAi-mediated knockdown and tested for changes in mosquito desiccation
            resistance. We found that AQPs are generally down-regulated 24 hrs after a blood meal.
            
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQP 1 strictly transports water, AQP 2 and 5 demonstrate limited solute transport,
            but primarily function as water transporters. AQP 4 is an aquaglyceroporin with multiple
            substrates. Knockdown of AQPs expressed in the MTs increased survival of 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> under dry conditions. We conclude that Malpighian tubules of adult female yellow
            fever mosquitoes utilize three distinct AQPs and one aquaglyceroporin in their osmoregulatory
            functions.
         </p>

      <p>The yellow fever mosquito, 
         <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, is a tropical mosquito with a worldwide distribution. It is the vector for dengue,
         yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses and it also transmits lesser known pathogens
         such as Zika virus
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</span>
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</span>
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</span>.
      </p>
      <p>As an anautogenous mosquito, 
         <i>Ae. aegypti</i> females require the uptake of vertebrate blood for reproduction. Blood meals are
         relatively large and can more than double the mass of a mosquito within a couple of
         minutes. Shortly after beginning a blood meal, mosquitoes start to produce large amounts
         of urine in order to concentrate the nutrients taken up and to eliminate excess sodium
         from the blood. They begin ejecting droplets of urine while still blood feeding
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</span>. In order to move this large volume of water, females use their highly efficient
         excretion system. Water and solutes are absorbed by the midgut into the hemolymph
         and from there are secreted by the Malpighian tubules (MTs) back into the alimentary
         canal where it is excreted through the hindgut and rectum
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</span>. MTs are the functional equivalent of vertebrate kidneys and contain protein channels
         and transporters that facilitate the transport of water and other solutes across the
         basal and apical membrane of their cells.
      </p>
      <p>Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of membrane transporters that regulate the flow of
         water and in some cases other small molecules across cellular membranes in both prokaryotic
         and eukaryotic cells and they are important players in the mosquito excretory system
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</span>. There are 13 AQP genes in mammals, which consist of two subfamilies. The first subfamily
         is the AQPs, which are thought to pass only water, the second are the aquaglyceroporins,
         which in addition to water pass small, nonpolar solutes like glycerol and urea
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</span>. The AQP channel forms an hourglass structure with six transmembrane alpha helical
         domains connected by five extramembrane loops. The asparagine-proline-alanine (NPA)
         motif is in the center of the pore and forms a ring
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</span>
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</span>
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</span>. This ring is the primary filter of the channel and regulates the flow of water through
         the channel. Previous studies have shown that Hg
         <sup>2+</sup> ions can interact with a cysteine residue near the NPA motif and block the flow of
         water molecules through the channel of most AQPs. Aquaglyceroporins differ from AQPs
         in pore size and amino acid composition of the channel
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</span>
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</span>.
      </p>
      <p>In earlier work, we surveyed the genome of 
         <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and identified six putative AQP genes
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</span>. Combining microarray, reverse transcription and qPCR data, we found that all six
         AQPs are expressed in distinct patterns in the female mosquito and at different time
         points before and after a blood meal. RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQPs 1, 4, or 5 significantly
         reduced the ability of mosquitoes to excrete injected saline
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</span>. Furthermore, the simultaneous knockdown of AQPs 1, 2, 4, and 5 further reduced the
         excretion rate. This suggests that AQPs 1, 4, and 5 form the primary water channels
         in 
         <i>Ae. aegypti</i> MTs.
      </p>
      <p>Here we have confirmed that the AQPs expressed in the MTs (AQPs 1, 2, 4, and 5) function
         as water channels and mediate transcellular water transport in adult female 
         <i>Ae</i>. 
         <i>aegypti</i>. We demonstrate that these proteins are indeed water channels and that AQP 4 is a
         multifunctional aquaglyceroporin that is capable of transporting a wide range of solutes.
         Lastly, individually knocking down AQPs 1, 4, and 5 increased the resistance of mosquitoes
         to desiccation stress.

         <h2>Results</h2>
         <div id="">
            <h3>Tissue expression</h3>
            <p>We used qPCR to evaluate relative AQP mRNA expression in different parts of the alimentary
               canal in female mosquitoes at two time points - 72 hrs post eclosion (PE) and 24 hrs
               post blood meal (PBM). We found that each AQP had a varied expression profile throughout
               the different organs/tissues observed (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</span>). AQP 1 was significantly upregulated in the midgut (MG) and the MTs PE. We observed
               a trend in AQP 1 expression in the hindgut (HG) PE, but it was not significantly upregulated.
               AQP 1 was downregulated in these tissues PBM. AQP 2 was significantly expressed in
               the foregut (FG), MG, and HG, and we observed a trend in the expression in the MTs
               PE, but this was not significant. This AQP was downregulated in these tissues PBM.
               There is no significant difference in AQP 3 expression levels in all the tissues before
               and after a blood meal. AQP 4 was significantly upregulated in the MTs and we observed
               a trend in expression levels in the MG PE, but this was not significant. These expression
               levels were downregulated PBM. AQP 5 is significantly upregulated in the MTs PE. We
               also observed a trend in AQP 5 expression in the MG PE, but this was not significant.
               AQP 5 expression was downregulated in these tissues PBM. There is no significant difference
               in AQP 6 expression levels in all the tissues before and after a blood meal.

            <h3>Water uptake assays</h3>
            <p>
               <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes are naturally impermeable to water and thereby are an ideal model system
               to study the water transport properties of heterologously expressed AQPs
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</span>. Negative control water-injected oocytes swelled minimally and failed to rupture
               even after extended incubation times. The cRNAs encoding Myc-tagged 
               <i>Ae</i>. 
               <i>aegypti</i> AQPs 1, 2, 4, or 5 were injected into 
               <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and AQP protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</span>). Oocytes expressing AQP 1, 2, or 5 showed significantly higher water permeability
               compared to the control (water-injected) oocytes; water permeation was inhibited when
               the oocytes were placed in 1 mM HgCl
               <div tagxxx="sub">2</div> solution (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</span>). There were no changes in the water permeation of the control oocytes in the HgCl
               <div tagxxx="sub">2</div> solution, consistent with nominal endogenous AQP expression.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div id="">
            <h3>Solute uptake assays</h3>
            <p>To investigate the substrate specificities of the 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQPs, they were expressed in 
               <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, which were subsequently subjected to non-radiolabeled solute transport analyses
               with six different solutes: glycerol, urea, erythritol, adonitol, mannitol, and trehalose
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</span>). AQP 1-expressing oocytes closely resembled the water-injected oocytes and did not
               demonstrate significant solute uptake. AQP 2-expressing oocytes also did not show
               significant solute uptake compared to the water-injected oocytes. Oocytes injected
               with AQP 4 cRNA consistently swelled in various test solutes to ~1.3 times their initial
               volume and ruptured within minutes. AQP 4 did not function as a strong water transporter
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</span>), but this AQP has significant transport capabilities for all other solutes tested
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</span>). AQP 5 demonstrated significantly high solute transport for trehalose. The results
               show a trend in the uptake of erythritol and adonitol via AQP 5, but the solute uptake
               was not significantly different than the water-injected oocytes.
            </p>

            <h3>Mosquito desiccation resistance assays</h3>
            <p>AQPs 1, 4, and 5 were knocked down individually in adult female 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes 72 hrs PE by injecting dsRNA followed by a three day recovery period.
               The desiccation assay measures the viability of the mosquitoes in dry conditions.
               We did not include AQP 2 in this experiment since 
               <i>in-vivo</i> diuresis assays performed in Drake et al., 2010 did not result in a significant rate
               of excretion for the AQP 2 knockdown group of mosquitoes
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</span>. Therefore, AQP 2 appears to be a relatively inefficient water transporter.
            </p>
            <p>Groups of five mosquitoes were placed in tubes with desiccant (&lt;20% humidity) and
               the survival of the mosquitoes was recorded at 30 minute intervals until all mosquitoes
               died. All three AQP-knockdown groups survived significantly longer than the control
               group (eGFP) under these conditions (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</span>).

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
         <p>Vertebrate and plant aquaporins have been extensively studied with a focus on their
            structure, substrate specificities, regulation, and roles as potential drug targets
            for various diseases
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</span>

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</span>. Compared to this wealth of knowledge relatively little is known about insect AQPs.
            Analyses of data from various genome projects suggest that the number of AQP genes
            in different insect species varies between six and ten
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</span>. In haematophagous insects, AQPs have been shown to be important for regulation of
            water homeostasis, desiccation resistance, blood meal compaction, and general osmoregulation
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</span>

         </p>
         <p>The first mosquito AQP was cloned from 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, AeaAQP or AaAQP 1, which is a close homologue of 
            <i>Drosophila</i> DRIP. AaAQP 1 is localized in the tracheolar cells that are associated with MTs,
            and it is strictly a water channel when expressed heterologously in 
            <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</span>. A homologous gene, AgAQP 1 has also been cloned and characterized in 
            <i>Anopheles</i>
            <i>gambiae.</i> AgAQP 1 transports water but not glycerol and is expressed in the MG, OV and MTs
            and plays a role in water homeostasis
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</span>. In the MTs, AgAQP 1 localizes to the basolateral membranes of stellate cells in
            the distal and proximal segments, respectively
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</span>. Furthermore, two splice variants of AgAQP 1 are expressed in an organ-specific manner
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</span>.
         </p>
         <p>The alimentary canal of the mosquito consists of the primary organs/tissues involved
            in digestion and excretion of nutrients and fluids
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</span>. In 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>, most water from blood meals is absorbed by the MG into the hemolymph and then secreted
            by the MTs. Concurringly, our results revealed that AQPs 1, 2, 4, and 5 were highly
            expressed in the MG and MTs, which confirmed data from a previous analysis
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</span>. AQP 2 is also highly expressed in the FG and HG (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</span>) which implies that these parts of the gut might also be involved in blood meal dehydration.
         </p>
         <p>Blood meal dehydration is a very efficient process. After three hours, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> females can excrete 75% of the total blood meal volume as urine
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</span>. After mosquitoes take blood, they seek out a resting place to allow vitellogenesis
            and egg development to take place during the next days. Post- blood meal diuresis
            typically subsides around 2 hours after a mosquito takes a blood meal, which has been
            shown in previous studies
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</span>. This matches the fact that we found many AQPs down regulated in the MTs and the
            MG at the 24 hrs PBM time point (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</span>). Interestingly, AQP 3 has similar expression levels before and after a blood meal
            in all alimentary canal tissues including the MTs. AQP 3 is most closely related to
            BIB-like AQPs
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</span>. BIB was first characterized in 
            <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and named 
            <u>bi</u>g 
            <u>b</u>rain (BIB) (CG4722 in FlyBase)
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</span>. This AQP does not function as a water channel in 
            <i>Drosophila</i>, instead, it is involved in the regulation of cell to cell adhesion
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</span>.
         </p>
         <p>Our results confirm that AQP 1 is a strict water channel
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</span>, and this is also true for AQP 2. These observations suggest that AQPs 1, 2, and
            5 are the main water channels in the MG and the MT and raise the possibility that
            these AQPs might be functioning together for efficient water permeability in these
            organs. This redundancy of function has been observed in previous studies in which
            multiple AQPs act together in the same tissue. For instance, in tsetse flies, the
            combined knockdown of three AQPs significantly extended larval pregnancy and ultimately
            led to dehydration of the developing larva while knockdown of a single AQP gene had
            a much weaker effect

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</span>. In the pea aphid, 
            <i>Acyrthosiphon pisum</i>, there is another identified aquaglyceroporin, ApAQP 2, which has been shown to be
            a multifunctional transport channel capable of passing a wide range of linear polyols,
            including glycerol, mannitol, and sorbitol
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</span>. Here we present the first characterization of aquaglyceroporins in a mosquito. 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQP 4 did demonstrate the lowest water permeability from all AQPs in our study, but
            significantly enhanced the uptake of all other solutes we tested - linear polyols,
            urea, and trehalose. The solute with the strongest uptake by AQP 4-expressing oocytes
            was glycerol, which is a precursor for the synthesis of triacylglycerols and of phospholipids
            and has also been shown to be important for insect cold tolerance and diapause
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</span>. 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQP 5-expressing oocytes also demonstrated significant solute permeability for trehalose.
            Trehalose is the primary sugar circulating in the hemolymph of an insect and can be
            considered insect ‘blood sugar'
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</span>. This molecule is the primary energy store in the mosquito and it is up regulated
            in the event of environmental stresses such as temperature changes and dehydration.
            In 
            <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, a trehalose transporter, AgTreT1, is highly expressed in the fat body and transports
            trehalose into the hemolymph
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</span>
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</span>. Interestingly, both, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQP 4 and 5, demonstrated significant transport of trehalose in the uptake assays.
            This is the first study that suggests transport of trehalose via a multifunctional
            aquaglyceroporin channel and proposes potential novel roles of these AQPs in regulation
            of mosquito hemolymph trehalose levels or uptake of circulating trehalose into tissues.
         </p>
         <p>In 2005, 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes were distributed throughout 23 of the United States in South and South-eastern
            regions including Southern Florida, Gulf coast of Texas and Louisiana. Recently, this
            distribution has spread to more arid and dry regions, such as Arizona and New Mexico.
            This raises the question as to how this tropical mosquito manages water conservation
            in the desert. Previous studies have shown that AQPs play a role in insect desiccation
            resistance and cold hardiness. For example, RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQP 1 in 
            <i>Anopheles</i>
            <i>gambiae</i> resulted in significantly longer survival of the knockdown group compared with the
            control group under desiccating conditions
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</span>. In the goldenrod gall fly, 
            <i>Eurosta solidaginis</i>, AQPs promote larval cell survival during freezing conditions
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</span>. Our results confirm the role that AQPs play in maintaining water homeostasis in
            adult mosquitoes. More specifically, the ability of 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> to conserve water in an extremely dry environment was significantly enhanced after
            RNAi-mediated knockdown of AQPs 1, 4, and 5 (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</span>). This suggests that the regulation of AQP expression in the alimentary canal could
            be an adaptive strategy to attenuate excretory water losses when 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> are exposed to an arid environment. How this is balanced with the need for rapid
            excretion after a blood meal is an interesting topic for future studies.
         </p>
         <p>In summary, our current findings confirm that 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i> AQPs 1, 2, and 5 transport water and are involved in the regulation of mosquito water
            homeostasis. AQP 4 is a multifunctional aquaglyceroporin with a wide range of solute
            transport capabilities. AQP 5 also functions as a limited aquaglyceroporin in 
            <i>Ae. aegypti</i>. Down regulation of AQPs 1, 4, and 5 enhanced mosquito desiccation resistance. Our
            data provide a basis for further investigation into the transport capabilities of
            mosquito AQPs. Further research is necessary to determine how expression and activity
            of these AQPs are regulated in mosquitoes.

               as previously described by Hays and Raikhel
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</span>. Mosquito larvae were hatched in large larval trays, and adult mosquitoes were maintained
               in Bugdorm-1 insect rearing cages (Bioquip, Rancho Dominguez, CA). Mosquitoes were
               maintained at a temperature of 28°C with 80% humidity and a photoperiod of 14:10 hrs
               Light:Dark. Larvae were fed on a diet of dry cat food. The adult mosquitoes were fed
               on a 20% sucrose solution.

               a template for dsRNA synthesis using the MEGAscript T7 Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). eGFP
               dsRNA was used as a control. 
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes 5–6 day post-emergence were collected by aspiration. 1000 ng of dsRNA
               in 268 nl of RNAase-free H2O was injected into the thorax of CO2-anesthetized female
               
               <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes three days after emergence. The injected mosquitoes were allowed to recover

               with qPCR at 3 days post-injection of dsRNA with knockdown efficiencies between 60–95%.
               On day 3 post-injection, groups of five mosquitoes for each treatment were placed

               <p>Expression was assayed using qPCR. The data represent relative quantification of 
                  <i>Aedes</i> AQPs which were normalized by qPCR analysis of ribosomal protein S7 (rpS7) mRNA levels
                  in the cDNA samples. Values are means ± S.E. (error bars) of triplicate biological
                  samples. The Y-axis shows expression ratios in arbitrary units with the lowest expressing
                  tissue set as 1. Means separated by Tukey–Kramer HSD (p &lt; 0.05). Means which share
                  the same letter are not significantly different. RNA was isolated from organs/body
                  parts of adult female mosquitoes unfed (light shaded columns) and 24 hrs after a blood
                  meal (dark shaded columns). C-crop, FG-foregut, MG-midgut, HG-hindgut, R-rectum, MT
