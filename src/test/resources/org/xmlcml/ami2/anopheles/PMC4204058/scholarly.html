            of humanitarianism, Chinese scientists has contributed to research of Artemisinin
            and ACTS more than 30 years, China provides long-term antimalaria assistance to Africa
            and gain great achievements. In Moheli, the island of Comoros, the antimalaria group
            used a new strategy which universal medication and proactive intervention. They established
            not only an effective antimalaria system and reporting system but also a local antimalaria
            team. Furthermore, they enhanced publicity and put mass protection and treatment into
            effect. Finally, they achieved significant result. In order to apply those successful
            experience to other countries in Africa, this paper summed up those experience and
            inspirations.

         <h2>Malaria Epidemic of the World</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p001You know some information about malaria transmission but I just remind the malaria
            is serious in Africa, this is according to the World Malaria Report 2012 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</span>]. We can know the information that 211 million malaria reported cases in the hospital
            and also the death cases are more than 616,000, but in fact because I was there in
            Africa a long time, in fact, more than 1 million death cases because all these cases
            are from the hospital report and the recent cases in the village and they are having
            the report (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p002As we know, the drug resistance is widely spread in the world. Even yesterday we had
            some information that even artemisinin drugs will have some drug resistance and how
            can we affect the anti-malaria drugs to treatment of malaria. We know that quinine
            was already used around 200 years. Artemisinin, we just used 30 years and how can
            we protect artemisinin. How can we use less effect anti-malaria drugs to control malaria?
            We think about—that’s why we use ACT to do MDA (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p003We considered about because now we have many kind of ACT, we use it. But, what kind
            of ACT we used with relate to MDA. We think about first we some advantage of these
            drugs. First, these drugs should give quick action, because in Africa in severe cases,
            short time maybe 24 hours, maybe some days, some cases will die. So this kind of ACT
            should be quick action and also it should have efficacy.
         </p>

         <h2>The Advantage of the ACTS for MDA</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p004If we want to organize MDA, safety is the first point we think about. ACT we select
            must have low toxicity. For African areas because for the population, they are so
            poor, even one family they cannot support to buy ACT, because ACT is little bit expensive
            for them. For example for coartem, they have 24 tablets and continue to use 3 days,
            6 times, so maybe one family may be divided to use coartem. Just they use four tablets
            for themselves and also four tablets for their children. They cannot finish the whole
            dose of ACT. So that’s why we are thinking about to select one simple ACT for them
            to use it and learn. They can confirm high prevalence and also in the environment
            of Africa because it is little bit different with Asia or even in Europe.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p005For the medicine stocking, even issue of single block is good stability for ACTs.
            That’s why we select this kind of ACT. This is only four tablets and 24 hours can
            finish the course of the treatment. Also, for the malaria transmission, how can we
            think about block transmission, how can we effect the gametocytes. Also, because this
            ACT contains artemisinin and we can know some information that artemisinin can affect
            gametocytes, so that can block transmission.

         <h2>The Malaria Control History</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p006Here, I will just review the malaria control history in China. Before in 1975 China,
            there were many malaria cases, there were millions of cases per year. But, after 1975s,
            because Chinese government also focused on malaria control project and also artemisinin
            has been already invented at that time, already three kinds of methods for malaria-controlled
            project. First is mass drug administration and the second method is positive treatment.
            In China, we have many cases with P. vivax. Right now, in small areas, they have P.
            vivax relapse and until now every year Chinese government they are continuing to organize
            some small projects as anti-malaria, anti-relapse treatment (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</span>) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</span>].
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p007We can get some data from 2011. Maybe someone will ask why there was less cases in
            2000, because at that time the Chinese CDC they haven’t build the report system, so
            at that time they could not get some information. But, after that we have the report
            system and we can know the malaria cases decreased around 2002 more than 13,000 cases
            per year and last year even 2011, they just had 3000 cases and most of the cases are
            from Africa and some cases are P. vivax (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</span>) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</span>].

         <h2>The Research History of Artemisinin</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p008For the artemisinin research for the Chinese scientists, how can they find these drugs
            and some books, just special to introduce history about this artemisinin research
            and later according to the complicated history reasons at that time because of the
            Vietnam War 1960s and at that time the relationship between China and Vietnam is good
            relationship and that’s why the leadership of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou just organized
            a special team to find out some anti-malarial drugs and they organized more than 200
            scientists and this team just looked for drugs from the herbal medicine and the herbal
            medicine is more than 3000 of herbal medicine, they go to look for it and go to find
            which kind of drugs can effect malaria. Why they select—they can find artemisinin
            because even 1060 years ago there is one book the Chinese had Zhou Hou Bei Ji Fang
            and it had one sentence in the record that artemisinin annua is herbal medicine that
            is qinghaosu and can treat malaria fever (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p009One scientist, she collected this information and learned. She went to do some test
            and checked artemisinin annua and after that artemisinin founded from artemisinin
            annua. This artemisinin also has some characteristics (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</span>).

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p010First is rapid effect to the lifecycle of the parasite even the ringform and gametocyte.
            All the parasite cycles artemisinin can effect and there is more effect than the others,
            anti-malaria drugs now we have many kinds of ACTs. For artemisinin has better stability
            than the other drugs and right now maybe some place because like in Thai and Cambodia
            border, maybe, there is some evidence that artemisinin has little bit drug resistance
            but we are not sure is it or not (

         <h2>The Malaria Control Project in Comoros</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p011This is model of malaria elimination project we conducted in Comoros by MDA. I think
            we know the transmission of the malaria. There are two reservoirs. First is mosquitoes
            and human. How can we block transmission, how can we eliminate the source? (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</span>)
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p012Because if we wanted to kill the parasite in the mosquito, I think it is a little
            bit difficult for us. Even in Europe and America now, I think we will have many kinds
            of mosquitoes. How can we eliminate the parasite, because it is easier to kill the
            parasite in the human body? So that’s why we think because also the lifetime of the
            mosquito is around 13 days and we can think about least period of the lifetime of
            mosquito, we can think about organizing MDA [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</span>]. So that’s why we conduct three rounds of MDA with artemisinin-piperaquine in Cambodia
            and also in Comoros, Africa, and learn from the result that effect the parasite. So
            that’s why block transmission from the human body to mosquito and then can block this
            transmission. This is just a model of elimination of malaria (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Fig. 9</span>) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</span>].
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p013From 2004, we conduct MDA project in Cambodia, two pilots, and the population is around
            4000 and we can know the results beyond 3 years and further parasite carriage rate
            is 56% and decreased by just around 1% [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</span>]. But, after that, because all this work is done by our university, but after that
            the local government they took responsibility for this project, so after 2006, we
            haven’t collected some more information. So, maybe, at this time, they have some recruiters.
            We can compare after the project in Comoros (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Fig. 10</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p014Where is Comoros? Comoros is a small country. I think it is one of the smallest countries
            in the world. Even you cannot get it from the map. It is located in the Indian Ocean
            and is located between Kenya and Madagascar. They have four islands in this country.
            In this island, Mayotte is controlled by France and the Comoros government just controls
            three islands. This is the smallest island. Their population is around 14,000 and
            we conducted the MDA project in this island in 2007 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</span>]. This is the second island. The population is around 320,000 and it is around 320
            square kilometers.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p015Also, we launched the MDA project last year and we can know we have got some information
            that these two islands, Moheli Island just have two or three cases per month [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</span>]. This second island, Anjouan Island, we just have five to six positive cases per
            month. I think these two islands are already under control of malaria. This year we
            launched the MDA project in this biggest island. The population is around 315,000.
            In this island, we now have one Chinese team and also the local team, they cooperate
            to carry out this project. This island they have some little bit difference with the
            other island. That’s why we spend more time to carry out the MDA project in this island.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p016How about the malaria situation in Comoros? We will have some information. First is
            epidemic with high prevalence around the year because 33% cases of all the patients
            have malaria and most of the inpatient is malaria. From the data, this data is from
            2007, but last year we have data, average annual cases is around 100,000 cases in
            the last year. But this data is 2007. Malaria is the first cause of morbidity and
            mortality in this country and 28% of under 5 years mortality in host-feeder is caused
            by malaria. But we have good opportunity for this country to control malaria because
            96% malaria is Plasmodium falciparum. That is the reason it is more easy to control
            with the other countries. There is low P. vivax in this country. Also, malaria is
            major public health problem. That’s why malaria problem is the large contributor of
            this country for social and economic development, so that’s why the President of Comoros
            many times he asked the Chinese government to give support and advised our university
            to do MDA to select this country to MDA. Also, the Chinese government requested the
            university to take responsibility in this malaria control project in this country
            (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F11">Fig. 11</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p017Let’s show the result of the Moheli’s island because the other island we are just
            collecting the data and after that also we can share the information. This Moheli’s
            Island just as I told you that’s just around 40,000 population and in this island
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</span>]. Before MDA, we have done two types of surveys in this island and only data is the
            prevalence is parasite carriage rate and we can know exactly all the village in this
            island is 24 villages and we have already covered all the survey in each village and
            we can know the result. Mostly parasite carriage rate in some village is severe and
            the average of the prevalence is around 23%, most of it is Plasmodium falciparum (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Fig. 12</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p018When we conducted MDA, how can we do it? Because we should make training of the local
            team. Because for the Chinese team we just have few persons to go to stay in the area
            and do some technical support and most of the work is according to the local team
            to do it. So how can we select local team and how can we train them? We have just
            few pictures to show. All of this people they have low education. Even they don’t
            know how to speak English but Comoros is French-speaking country and also most of
            them they don’t speak French. Before that they don’t know how to use microscope, so
            we should organize this team to maintain the work, so that’s why we selected this
            team and we trained them to use microscope and training them to do the survey, to
            do the blood smear and after 3 months after training all of them they know how to
            do the survey and even they know to check blood smear, which is positive and which
            is negative. This local team, they continued to work and also the local government
            supported this team to continue and that’s why as a result Moheli maintained malaria
            (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Fig. 13</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p019This is the first day of MDA in the village this is some interesting story. This is
            the oldest man, their chief of the village and he was the first guy to take drug and
            you can look all the population is looking at him and after he took the drug the other
            population asked this oldest man, how about the taste? Is it bitter or sweet or sour
            and is it poison? So after 1 hour this guy took the drug, the other population they
            believed this drug is for health, is not poison. That’s why I speak about drugs because
            to organize MDA, it’s difficult to ask all the population to take the drugs at the
            same time, but we should organize very well. We should do the relation and mobilization
            before MDA, so that is why we spend lot of time to do this. Every day we go to the
            village to give them the information, why we organize MDA, what about the malaria
            situation in the island, how to protect the family. That is not easy. I just say MDA—but
            now we have some experience and we can know the result after 3 months of MDA. We can
            know the parasite carriage rate decreased by 97% and this is the rapid for malaria
            control project (

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</span>].

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p020Further parasite carriage rate also we can compare before MDA and after MDA. This
            is 23% and after MDA just around 1% and we continue to do survey and is maintained
            1% right until now [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</span>]. We also in the first year of this project we did some survey of the entomology
            survey and this is for human checked and we can compare with country island. Entomologist
            result just changed by the natural change by the seasons and the country island we
            can know after MDA just after some months is 0%. This is the result of the positive
            cases in the hospital country island and study island and we can know exactly for
            the country island for the positive cases just natural change and for the study island
            just have some few cases in the month (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F15">Fig. 15</span>).
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p021For the progress, also this is summary of this MDA project because also I introduced
            the progress of this project in Comoros and also I think someone will ask is it possible
            to eliminate malaria in Comoro. For myself the answer is yes, but I don’t know when.
            We know how to eliminate but we don’t know when we can eliminate malaria in this country,
            because most of the work should be done by the local government and also we needed
            international cooperation and also make sure they integrate methods to eliminate malaria.
            Thank you (

                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p022Now, we have controversial issue that is mass drug administration for malaria elimination.
                     We have exciting guests from Guangzhou University of Chinese medicine, Professor Song
                     and Dr. Deng. Almost 40 years ago, their group led by Professor Lee successfully developed
                     artemisinin from Chinese traditional medicine qinghaosu.

                     <b>Akira Kaneko</b> Now open for discussion and comments. Yes please.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p024
                     <b>Male Participant</b> Thanks for the talk. It is incredible to see the reduction and very, very optimistic
                     and promising results. It’s beautiful, well done. I suppose it is the obvious question
                     and probably everybody is thinking about and that is the Comoros islands there. Even
                     if you do manage to eliminate malaria if you don’t eliminate the Anopheles mosquitoes
                     you have still got the potential for malaria to come back and the big worry of course
                     is that you change the situation from one of stable endemic malaria to one of epidemic
                     malaria and you sandwich between Madagascar and between Kenya where there are high
                     rates of malaria and there is presumably transfer of people, you’re going to have
                     to monitor forever, presumably cases of malaria coming in because it will be extremely
                     dangerous if in 10 years or 50 years’ time when all the immunity in the local is gone.
                     If an epidemic of malaria occurred in this region, it could be, well, you know, disastrous.
                     So, the long-term commitment to the island has to be extremely long-term forever or
                     until that beautiful day when malaria itself is eliminated from Africa. So what plans
                     do you have to stay in Comoros and monitor after the elimination has been achieved.
                     I think that’s my main question.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p025
                     <b>Deng Changsheng</b> Thank you for your comment and the question. Just now also I speak we can achieve
                     elimination of malaria in Comoros and also we think about how can we maintain after
                     MDA and so that’s why we request, also we cooperate with the local government. They
                     should have responsibility to maintenance and they should build the system, the health
                     system to maintain this result and also how can we prevent the transmission from the
                     other island and from the other countries. We have already built one station in the
                     airport and also in the port and they will have some local team to continue to do
                     this work and also we think about cooperation with other integrate project for example
                     the [Unclear] DDT in the island. We do not think about it in a single way to eliminate
                     malaria by MDA. We think about the other integrate methods, strategy for elimination
                     of malaria.

                     <b>Male Participant</b> Thank you very much for your nice presentation. My question is related to the Richard’s
                     [ph] question. You have 1% prevalence in malaria after the MDA so that means 400 people
                     still have parasite, right?
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p028
                     <b>Deng Changsheng</b> From the data of the hospital we just found…
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p030
                     <b>Male Participant</b> From the hospital, okay.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p031
                     <b>Deng Changsheng</b> Yes, in the hospital cases.
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p032
                     <b>Male Participant</b> In that case, the 1% prevalence is continued now, but after maybe for several years
                     if the prevalence increases, that means probably the resistance parasite produce it
                     after MDA. In that case, the situation maybe serious so what is your idea about this?
                  </p>

                     <b>Deng Changsheng</b> Yes, maybe, some small area maybe recruiters in some time but that’s why we have
                     the supervised team, supervised system to avoid this to happen and also every village
                     we have one local team to supervise to follow up in the village. Every week they should
                     report the cases to the Center of Malaria Control Program in the country and every
                     week we can know the information exactly and if some cases if it is increased we can
                     control it rapid. Is it clear?

                     <b>Male Participant</b> Okay. [Unclear] countries follow their population structure of the parasite and compare
                     it before and after MDA.

                     <b>Akira Kaneko</b> You can discuss later. I have one question. What is the inning of the malaria eradication
                     game? How long does it take to globally eradicate malaria? Is it 50 years, 100 years,
                     or 1000 years? Do you have any view? What is your view?
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p043
                     <b>Deng Changsheng</b> Actually, I have no idea about it. Can I invite Professor Song’s comment?
                  </p>
                  <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">p044
                     <b>Jianping Song</b> It is a very good question, maybe most of the people are concerned, the malaria elimination
                     date. I hope it is tomorrow, but actually malaria can be eliminated, because Japan,
                     America, malaria is free and in many European countries, no malaria. Why Africa and
                     other malaria epidemic countries still have so severe malaria? I think we have very
                     good drugs, artemisinin. In the anti-malarial history, only artemisinin has the efficacy
                     to [Unclear]. So, it is opportunities for the human to eliminate malaria in the world.
                     So we use the mass medication of artemisinin in Comoros and Cambodia. Already, more
                     than 400,000 people freed with malaria. Actually, no people died and the malaria problem
                     is keeping very, very low levels. But, if we want to do global malaria elimination,
                     it is very complicated progress. We need to correct the policies, the [Unclear] and
                     cooperation between the countries and the different people, more people enrolled in
                     the project. But, I think Comoros motto will lead African countries to put elimination
                     procedure in the world. Thank you.
