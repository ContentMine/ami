            <i>N,N</i>-diethyl-
            <i>m</i>-toluamide (DEET) has been registered for commercial use as an insect repellent for
            over five decades, and is used widely across the world. Concerns over the safety of
            DEET first emerged during the 1980s after reports of encephalopathy following DEET
            exposure, particularly in children. However, the role of DEET in either the illness
            or deaths was and remains purely speculative. In response to these cases a number
            of reviews and investigations of DEET safety were carried out. Here we examine the
            methods used and information available to determine the safety of DEET in humans.
            Animal testing, observational studies and intervention trials have found no evidence
            of severe adverse events associated with recommended DEET use. Minor adverse effects
            noted in animal trials were associated with very large doses and were not replicated
            between different test species. The safety surveillance from extensive humans use
            reveals no association with severe adverse events. This review compares the toxicity
            assessment using three different models to define the risk assessment and safety threshold
            for DEET use in humans and discusses the clinical consequences of the thresholds derived
            from the models.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The theoretical risks associated with wearing an insect repellent should be weighed
            against the reduction or prevention of the risk of fatal or debilitating diseases
            including malaria, dengue, yellow fever and filariasis. With over 48 million European
            residents travelling to regions where vector borne diseases are a threat in 2009,
            restricting the concentration of DEET containing repellents to 15% or less, as modelled
            in the 2010 EU directive, is likely to result in extensive sub-therapeutic activity
            where repellents are infrequently applied. Future European travellers, as a consequence
            of inadequate personal protection, could potentially be at increased risk of vector
            borne diseases. Risk assessments of repellents should take these factors into account
            when setting safe limits.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
            <i>N,N</i>-diethyl-
            <i>m</i>-toluamide (DEET) is amongst the most effective and widely used of insect repellents
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</span>]. DEET was one of the first synthetic repellents, initially developed by the United
            States Department of Agriculture and then used by the military. It was registered
            for use by the general public in 1957, and remains the most widely used repellent
            with an estimated 30% of the US population using insect repellent in 2000 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</span>]. In 2011, a sample survey for the EPA, showed that US consumers bought insect repellent
            on average 2.87 times per year, and 3.49 times if there were children in the family
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</span>]. Given the greater awareness of vector borne diseases such as West Nile virus, tick-borne
            encephalitis and Lyme disease, insect repellent use is likely to increase, and sales
            reports show that sales of insect repellents increased 28% between 2001 and 2003 [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</span>]. There are now a range of synthetic and naturally derived repellent compounds, and
            of these, Icaridin and PMD have been shown to provide effective protection, however,
            due to its long history DEET still has the strongest body of evidence for efficacy
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</span>]. Another synthetic repellent, IR3535 has shown reduced efficacy against 
            <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes and as such is not recommended for travellers to endemic areas [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</span>]. In testing of new actives ingredients, 20% DEET is the gold standard for comparison
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</span>] and shows efficacy against a wide variety of blood-feeding organisms: from mosquitoes
            and black flies to ticks, mites and even land leeches [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</span>].
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Concerns over the safety of DEET first emerged in the 1980s after reports of encephalopathy
            following DEET exposure, particularly in children [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</span>]. Although the role of DEET in these cases was purely speculative, they prompted
            a number of investigations and a number of reviews of the safety of DEET.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The process of undertaking a comprehensive safety risk assessment of a chemical requires
            a four stage review [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</span>]. The first stage is hazard identification, which identifies the capacity of the
            chemical to generate adverse effects in humans. The second is a dose–response test
            to establish a relationship between dose and the incidence of adverse events. The
            third includes toxicity assessment data from animal or human exposure to define a
            final safe exposure limit in humans (Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</span>). Much of the data used to assess the safety of DEET relies on animal studies, with
            only a single observational trial of DEET use in pregnancy so far carried out on humans.
            The final stage is a risk assessment that combines the safe exposure limits with likely
            levels and routes of exposure.

            <h3>Toxicity studies of DEET in animals</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Animal toxicity testing provides basic data where human exposure information is inadequate
               or unavailable. Most tests only collect information on obvious toxicity effects such
               as changes in body weight, without defining the mechanisms of toxicity. The United
               States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) carried out a series of experiments
               in 1998 as part of a DEET re-registration process [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</span>]. The majority of studies revealed minor effects of DEET and different NOEL, depending
               on the exposure route (Table 
               <span ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</span>). The experiments of most interest involve dermal exposures to DEET, including a
               90-day dermal toxicity study in rats using exposures up to 1000 mg/kg body weight/day.
               At the greatest exposure male rats were observed to develop renal lesions and a decreased
               body weight, and both sexes showed increased liver weights. As renal lesions were
               observed in all males at every exposure level, the study was unable to establish a
               no observed effect level (NOEL). Detailed investigations revealed that the renal lesions
               were unique to male rats and not relevant to human health [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</span>]. A similar study using micropigs, found no changes in mortality, body weight, blood
               biochemistry, gross pathology or organ weights due to DEET exposure up to 1000 mg
               per kg body weight per day [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</span>].

            <h3>Studies and case reports of DEET safety in humans</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Studies in humans have clear advantages as they avoid the errors when extrapolating
               results from animal studies. In humans, secondary risk factors such as smoking and
               diet can also be considered. Testing involving animals will largely be drawn from
               homogenous populations with similar susceptibility to the chemical being tested, whereas
               human populations will mostly contain a wide range of individuals with varying susceptibility.
               Observational studies and case reports form the basis of most human toxicological
               studies. Case reports, although highly subjective and sometimes anecdotal, can be
               useful in identifying rare associated effects such as unique reactions or association
               with rare diseases. Observational studies, not easily done, do not allow for any control
               of assignment of study subjects to either group or the levels of exposure and controlling
               for confounding factors. Randomised trials using human subjects provide the most rigorous
               data on safety, but for ethical and safety reasons these trials are rare in toxicological
               investigations.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Although no human studies have been carried out specifically to assess the safety
               of DEET, a randomised trial of DEET used to prevent malaria transmission amongst pregnant
               women in Thailand did assess health outcomes in participants [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</span>]. The women were all past their first trimester and when recruited to the trial were
               monitored for the duration of the pregnancy at weekly ante-natal visits. Their babies
               were then monitored monthly until six months old and then every three months until
               one year. No significant differences were found between the DEET treatment group and
               control group in weight, height, head and arm circumferences, and neurologic performance
               in newborns. Similarly, infants followed to one year showed no significant difference
               in developmental delay, death, weight, height, head circumference and arm circumference
               between those whose mothers had used DEET and non-users. Neither were there any differences
               in the occurrences of neurological or gastrointestinal effects in the women. Skin
               warming, a heating sensation on the skin, was significantly more common in the DEET
               group. DEET was not detected in urine, however, it was detected in the cord blood
               from four (8%) of the women indicating that DEET is able to cross the placenta. The
               ability of DEET to cross the placenta is confirmed in a survey of pesticides in cord
               blood amongst mothers in New Jersey [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</span>]. DEET was detectable in the blood and cord blood of all women analysed, although
               no significant effects on birth weight, head circumference or birth length were found,
               but a borderline association between higher DEET levels in the cord blood and higher
               abdominal circumference was noted. At present such trials are rare and limited, so
               there is no data for the safety of DEET in the first trimester, on the effects of
               ante-natal DEET exposure beyond one year follow up.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">During the mid-1980s there were six reported cases of encephalopathy following exposure
               to DEET, all in girls aged 1–8 years which resulted in three deaths [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</span>]. However, it is unclear whether exposure to DEET was the real cause of the seizures
               or deaths. The first case involved a 3 and a half year old girl who developed seizures,
               and it was reported that for the two weeks prior to the illness DEET had been applied
               to her clothes, bedding and skin resulting in an estimated exposure of 0.14 ml per
               kg body weight per day [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</span>]. One of the fatal cases involved a six year old girl [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</span>] who had applied DEET ‘extensively’. However, in this case a history of similar episodes
               without DEET exposure led to the hypothesis that the girl may have had undiagnosed
               ornithine carbamyl transferase deficiency. In this case medical opinion was that,
               although DEET may have precipitated the episode, the cause of death may have been
               one of the medicines administered during her stay in hospital. A further case was
               of an 8 year old girl who developed a rash on areas where DEET had been ‘copiously’
               applied in the previous 4 days [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</span>]. She then suffered seizures before making full recovery. The authors reporting the
               case believed that, in contrast to previous reports, this case was a true hypersensitive
               reaction to DEET.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Ten years later there had been a further eight cases of nervous system toxicity following
               DEET exposure. No gender bias was found across all fourteen cases, but all but one
               involved children under 8 years [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</span>]. The prevalence of encephalopathy during this age range is higher as is the use
               of DEET use and encephalopathy, therefore it is not surprising to find an apparent
               association in some cases [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</span>]. Despite the term ‘DEET-induced encephalopathy’ in some case reports [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</span>], no link to dose or mechanistic pathway has been demonstrated between the use of
               DEET and the occurrence of encephalopathy. Although DEET might be causally associated
               in these cases, often there is a lack of data on the actual concentrations and exposures
               involved. A full analysis of these cases is not intended in this review, as the subject
               has been ably covered by other authors [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</span>,
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</span>]. An analysis was made of over 9,000 calls relating to DEET exposure that were placed
               to American Poison Control Centres from 1985–9 [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</span>]. Almost 90% were treated solely at home and 80% of those referred to a health centre
               were discharged after initial examination suggesting mild or short-lived symptoms.
               The severity of symptoms was found to be more closely related to the type of exposure
               with inhalation or contact with eyes causing greater symptoms, than the concentration
               of DEET or the age or gender of the patient. A second review of over 20,000 calls
               between 1993–7 found consistent results [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</span>].
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A DEET Registry was created to collate information on severe adverse neurological
               or systemic events associated with DEET use in a standardised way in order to evaluate
               any potential causal relationship [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</span>]. Two hundred and forty-two cases that had been referred to the DEET Registry between
               1995 and 2001 were assessed by qualified nurses and followed up after one year. It
               was found that children were not disproportionately represented amongst cases. Children
               made up 41% of DEET cases in this analysis compared to 65% of any calls to Poisons
               Centres between 1983 and 2009 [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</span>]. However, compared to adults in the analysis, children were more likely to have
               experienced seizures and 71% of seizure patients were children. This is not a remarkable
               finding, however, as seizures are more common in children than adults [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</span>]. No relationship was evident between DEET concentration and severity of outcome,
               but as with the case reports of seizures described above, estimating actual DEET exposure
               is difficult given the variation in self-administered doses.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Even when allowing for a large factor of underreporting, the incidence of 14 reported
               cases of DEET-associated encephalopathy since 1957 is small when considered against
               the context of an estimated 200 million applications of DEET worldwide each year [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</span>]. Some individuals can develop allergic responses to DEET, which result in serious
               reactions through even small exposures [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</span>]. However, for adult consumers, and based on these observational studies, there is
               no basis in the observational data for concerns over the safety of DEET.

            <h3>Risk assessment of DEET</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Results from animals need to be extrapolated to be relevant to human health. It is
               standard practice to take 10% of NOEL from animal data to account for differences
               between animal and human metabolism and then a further adjustment to 10% of that dose
               (100
               <sup>th</sup> the original dose), to create a safe maximum exposure limit [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</span>]. However, as this approach can lead to a large correction factor, it is acknowledged
               that risk assessments resulting in unacceptable exposures should be further examined
               to ensure the findings are sensible and that a more refined assessment is not required
               [

               <i>et al.</i> carried out a risk assessment of DEET [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</span>] using both the results of USEPA toxicity testing and those of Schoenig 
               <i>et al.</i> in which DEET was only administered orally [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</span>,
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</span>]. To estimate risk to human health NOELs were set at 200 mg/kg body weight/day for
               acute exposures, 300 mg/kg body weight/day for subchronic exposures and 100 mg/kg
               body weight/day for chronic exposures. A survey of repellent use by men, women and
               children found that the dose applied did not vary with age, gender or the actual DEET
               concentration [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</span>]. The average dose applied in a single application was 3.7 g. Antwi 
               <i>et al.</i> then used this to model the level of DEET exposure associated with the use of 5%,
               25% and 40% DEET repellent products. None of the estimated exposures were equal or
               greater than the NOELs. However, a single 3.7 g application of a 40% DEET product
               is above 1% of the NOEL for all age groups and a single application of 25% is above
               1% of the NOEL for children under 17 years old. The 1% of the NOEL, as established
               from animal testing, is recognised as the safe exposure limit. This therefore means
               a 40% DEET product is qualified as unsafe for human use but is based on rat experimental
               data, where animals at higher dose exposures developed non-specific weight loss and
               male renal abnormalities.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The USEPA committee, however, considered the effects observed in rats at 1000 mg per
               kg body weight per day as so modest and the dosage so high, that it did not form sufficient
               grounds for conducting a quantitative risk assessment. They did not ,therefore, define
               a minimum dose of DEET for daily use.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The 2010 EU directive, using the same data source as the USEPA recommends an acceptable
               exposure level (AEL) for repeated use of 8.2 mg DEET per kg body weight per day [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</span>]. This dose is equivalent to a single application of 3.3 g of a 15% DEET formulation
               to an adult weighing 60 kg. The directive has used the standard 1% correction shown
               in Figure 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</span> as well as an 82% correction for different absorption rates between animals and humans
               to achieve this final safety margin. This assessment did not reference the different
               outcomes and findings of the USEPA study.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">All three studies have used the same toxicity data to determine safe exposure levels,
               but only the USEPA considered a full risk assessment was not necessary. Based on the
               modest effects of DEET shown in the human toxicity data, it is questionable as to
               whether a risk assessment should be done. The decision about whether a chemical should
               be given a full risk assessment is an important step as often chemicals with low toxicity
               do not require this assessment. The different conclusions, based on the same data,
               demonstrate the difficulties and uncertainties involved in modelling toxicity.

            <h3>Synergistic effects of DEET with insecticides</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Illnesses reported by service personnel returning from the Gulf War have been linked
               to synergistic effects of DEET used alongside permethrin (an insecticide impregnated
               into clothing) and pyridostigmine bromide (a prophylactic agent against the effects
               of nerve gas). In toxicity studies using animals, rats exposed to combinations of
               DEET and pyridostigmine bromide had greater than expected mortality, but lower than
               expected mortality was observed in rats exposed to combinations of DEET and permethrin
               [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</span>]. Pyridostigmine bromide alone has been shown to impair rat behavioural performance,
               but combined with DEET leads to further loss in performance [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</span>]. As an anti-nerve gas agent, few people would be expected to be exposed to pyridostigmine
               bromide. Therefore, it is possible to control combined exposure in these select group
               without prohibiting the use of DEET. The combination of DEET and permethrin is a more
               likely combination in use in the general population with products such as insecticide
               treated bed nets and clothing. In vitro and animal experiments show that DEET is a
               cholinesterase inhibitor [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</span>], and in combination with permethrin has measurable effects indicating DNA damage
               and oxidative stress in rats, and also increases the release of rat brain mitochondrial
               cytochrome C and disrupts the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in rats [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</span>]. Further work is required to determine the mechanism that could lead to adverse
               effects for human health using doses and applications that are relevant to DEET use
               by travellers.

            <h3>Implications for disease transmission</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The use of repellents as personal bite protection is recommended to travellers for
               protection against arthropod borne diseases in tropical countries. However, mostly
               due to concerns over cost rather than long term exposure, it is not recommended to
               people living in vector-borne disease endemic countries. Although there have been
               relatively few studies that have measured disease outcomes associated with the use
               of repellents alone, and those that have been published have resulted in variable
               results in protection, there is evidence that topical repellents can reduce vector
               borne disease transmission including malaria [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</span>,
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</span>] as well as pediculosis, sandfly fever and scrub typhus [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</span>]. The efficacy of repellents, in part, relies on the efficacy of the active ingredient,
               the longevity (how long it lasts) and user compliance. Undoubtedly, DEET is the most
               effective and long-lasting providing the concentration is high enough and it is well-formulated.
               In laboratory testing different concentrations have been shown to provide different
               protection times. For example, in one study, formulations of DEET below 20% provided
               complete protection for only 20 minutes, whereas in comparable tests, those between
               20-50% provided complete protection for 3 hours [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</span>]. Bearing in mind the likely effect of sweating and rubbing off on clothes in hot
               climates, the level of DEET on the skin is likely to reduce rapidly in this environment.
               In another study, people who exercise after applying a repellent based soap have been
               found to have 10-30% less protection from bites compared to those who had not exercised
               [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</span>]. Therefore, to achieve high levels of protection and maintain this over a practical
               time period before having to reapply is essential for any repellents to protect against
               disease transmission in travellers. The suggested application rate of 8.2 mg DEET
               per kg body weight per day, equates to a single application of 2.46 g of a 20% DEET
               product for an adult. The application volume or weight of a DEET product, based on
               the standard application used in repellency testing of 1.67 ml/mg/cm
               <sup>2</sup> required to cover 2 arms would be 5.7 ml/g product (18% surface area). A 15% concentration
               product would contain 855 mg DEET and a 50% product would contain 2850 mg of DEET.
               These DEET levels are above the Directives maximum 492 mg per day (for a person weighing
               60 kg) and would not allow repeated application or application to other parts of the
               body sufficient to provide long lasting protection against most vectors of disease.
               In field testing of 20-35% DEET formulations, investigators have used up to 6 ml to
               protect exposed limbs, usually forearms, lower legs and feet [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</span>], but sometimes only the lower legs [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</span>,
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</span>].

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Risk assessments of chemical exposures rely on exposure and toxicity assessments which
            both involve a margin of error. Risk assessments use a conservative estimate of exposure
            to describe the lowest safe estimates of toxicity. To ensure low-risk chemicals are
            not subjected to lengthy assessments a tiered approach is normally used [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</span>]. With DEET assessments, this is the point at which there is a difference in approach
            between researchers. The standard risk assessment takes the toxicity profile in rats,
            applies a conversion factor to apply the data to humans and another to establish a
            safe exposure level. This blind approach finds normal exposure DEET products above
            15% leads to excessive exposure. In contrast, other researchers considered the observed
            adverse effects in rats (reduced food consumption and decreased weight gain) has no
            relevance to human risk and therefore do not complete any further risk assessment.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Biting arthropods transmit an array of vector-borne pathogens that cause diseases
            including malaria, dengue, Lyme disease, filariasis, onchocerciasis and West Nile
            virus. These diseases have a significant human health impact and many have no specific
            prophylaxis, treatment or vaccines. Therefore, insect repellents are important in
            reducing or preventing these insect borne infections. DEET is the most effective and
            widely used insect repellent with an estimated 200 million annual applications worldwide.
            With over 48 million European residents travelling annually to regions where vector
            borne diseases are a threat [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</span>], restricting the concentration of DEET containing repellents to 15% or less, as
            modelled in the 2010 EU directive based on toxicity estimates from NOELS in animals,
            is likely to result in extensive sub-therapeutic activity where repellents are infrequently
            applied [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</span>]. Comparisons between marketed repellents show that formulation as well as DEET concentration
            will greatly effect longevity of protection [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</span>], therefore, although not yet available, low DEET repellents could eventually provide
            a long-lasting protection. Future European travellers, as a consequence of inadequate
            personal protection, are likely to be at increased risk of vector borne diseases.
            It is therefore essential that any risk assessment of the toxicity of DEET needs to
            be balanced by its benefit in avoiding disease and extensive global data on the widespread
            use of DEET and reported human toxicity.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Policy recommendation on DEET use needs to balance the available toxicity data, and
            its historical safety record, against the risks of vector borne diseases. Conventional
            risk assessment methodology leads to a recommendation to reduce the use of higher
            concentrations of DEET, but fails to recognise the disease avoiding benefits of DEET.
            A pragmatic approach along with future research to describe toxicity thresholds in
            humans are the way forward.
