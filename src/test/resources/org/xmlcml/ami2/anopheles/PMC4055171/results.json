To effectively guide malaria control operations, regular update on the role of local Anopheles species is essential. Therefore, an entomological survey was conducted between August 2010 and May 2011 to evaluate the role of the local anopheline population in malaria transmission in three villages of the Ndop health district in the northwest region of Cameroon where malaria is holoendemic, as a means to acquiring evidence based data for improved vector intervention. METHODS: Mosquitoes were sampled both indoor and outdoor for four consecutive nights in each locality during each month of survey. Sampling was done by the human landing catch method on volunteers. Anopheles species were identified morphologically and their ovaries randomly dissected for parity determination. Infection with Plasmodium falciparum was detected by Circumsporozoite protein ELISA. Members of An. gambiae complex were further identified to molecular level by PCR and RFLP PCR. RESULTS: An. ziemanni was the main malaria vector and whether outdoor or indoor. The man biting rate for the vectors ranged from 6.75 to 8.29 bites per person per night (b/p/n). The entomological inoculation rate for this vector species was 0.0278 infectious bites per person per night (ib/p/n) in Mbapishi, 0.034 ib/p/n in Mbafuh, and 0.063 ib/p/n in Backyit. These were by far greater than that for An. gambiae. No difference was observed in the parity rate of these two vectors. PCR analysis revealed the presence of only An. colluzzi (M- form). CONCLUSIONS: An. ziemanni is an important local malaria vector in Ndop health district. The findings provide useful baseline information on the anopheles species composition, their distribution and role in malaria transmission that would guide the implementation of integrated vector management strategies in the locality."],"affiliation":["National Reference Unit for Vector Control, The Biotechnology Center, University of Yaoundé I, P,O, Box 3851-Messa, Yaoundé, Cameroon. tnraymon@yahoo.fr."],"language":["eng"],"pubModel":["Electronic"],"pubTypeList":[{"pubType":["Journal Article","Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"]}],"meshHeadingList":[{"meshHeading":[{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Animals"]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Humans"]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Anopheles"],"meshQualifierList":[{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":["CL"],"qualifierName":["classification"],"majorTopic_YN":["Y"]},{"abbreviation":["PS"],"qualifierName":["parasitology"],"majorTopic_YN":["Y"]}]}]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Malaria"],"meshQualifierList":[{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":["EP"],"qualifierName":["epidemiology"],"majorTopic_YN":["N"]},{"abbreviation":["TM"],"qualifierName":["transmission"],"majorTopic_YN":["Y"]}]}]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Insect Bites and Stings"]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Insect Vectors"],"meshQualifierList":[{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":["PS"],"qualifierName":["parasitology"],"majorTopic_YN":["Y"]},{"abbreviation":["PH"],"qualifierName":["physiology"],"majorTopic_YN":["N"]}]}]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Biodiversity"]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Animal Distribution"]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Cameroon"],"meshQualifierList":[{"meshQualifier":[{"abbreviation":["EP"],"qualifierName":["epidemiology"],"majorTopic_YN":["N"]}]}]},{"majorTopic_YN":["N"],"descriptorName":["Feeding Behavior"]}]}],"subsetList":[{"subset":[{"code":["IM"],"name":["Index Medicus"]}]}],"fullTextUrlList":[{"fullTextUrl":[{"availability":["Open access"],"availabilityCode":["OA"],"documentStyle":["pdf"],"site":["Europe_PMC"],"url":["http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4055171?pdf=render"]},{"availability":["Open access"],"availabilityCode":["OA"],"documentStyle":["html"],"site":["Europe_PMC"],"url":["http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4055171"]},{"availability":["Free"],"availabilityCode":["F"],"documentStyle":["pdf"],"site":["PubMedCentral"],"url":["http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=24903710&action=stream&blobtype=pdf"]},{"availability":["Free"],"availabilityCode":["F"],"documentStyle":["html"],"site":["PubMedCentral"],"url":["http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=EBI&pubmedid=24903710"]},{"availability":["Subscription required"],"availabilityCode":["S"],"documentStyle":["doi"],"site":["DOI"],"url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-7-262"]}]}],"isOpenAccess":["Y"],"inEPMC":["Y"],"inPMC":["Y"],"citedByCount":["0"],"hasReferences":["Y"],"hasTextMinedTerms":["Y"],"hasDbCrossReferences":["N"],"hasLabsLinks":["N"],"hasTMAccessionNumbers":["N"],"dateOfCompletion":["2015-02-04"],"dateOfCreation":["2014-06-13"],"electronicPublicationDate":["2014-06-05"],"firstPublicationDate":["2014-06-05"],"luceneScore":["477.77493"]}
