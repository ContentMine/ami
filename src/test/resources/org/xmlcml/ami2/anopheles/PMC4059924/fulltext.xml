<italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria live within the cells of many insect species, manipulating their hosts&#x02019; reproduction and immune responses. Here, the authors show that these microbes also infect wild populations of malaria-spreading <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, supporting a potential use of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to limit malaria transmission.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Malaria-transmitting <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes are the deadliest animals on this planet, causing the death of more than 600,000 people each year and endangering the lives of half of the world&#x02019;s population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Current insecticide-based control strategies to stop malaria transmission by targeting the mosquito vector are limited by the rapid spread of insecticide resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In addition, these interventions target only indoor feeding and resting populations, with the use of insecticide-treated bednets and the application of indoor residual sprays, respectively. For decades, the use of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> endosymbionts has been proposed as an alternative to chemical strategies because of the ability of these bacteria to rapidly invade insect populations via cytoplasmic incompatibility<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, and successful <italic>Wolbachia</italic> invasions in field settings have been demonstrated in the case of the dengue and yellow fever vector <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.

Indeed, while <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains have been detected in many insects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, attempts to identify these bacteria in field <italic>Anopheles</italic> have failed, promoting the belief that these mosquitoes are not natural hosts for <italic>Wolbachia</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we report evidence of natural <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in two incipient species of the major malaria vector, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>. We isolate <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-specific <italic>16S</italic> rRNA sequences from the reproductive organs and carcasses of adult mosquitoes and from larval carcasses in three different villages in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing of two positive samples reveals a previously uncharacterized <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain that is maternally transmitted in laboratory settings. These results open new avenues for exploiting <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections for field applications targeting the malaria mosquito.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences detected in field <italic>An. gambiae</italic> populations</title><p>We collected mating couples from natural <italic>An. gambiae</italic> mating swarms in Burkina Faso, West Africa, to identify the microbial populations of the male and female reproductive tracts. We analysed two reproductively isolated populations of <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, the M and S molecular forms, which do not interbreed in the field<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> and are now classified as two separate species (<italic>An. coluzzii</italic> and <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). For simplicity, in the text and in the tables, we will refer to these two species as M and S forms. Our collections included 81 couples captured in three different villages: two villages in Vall&#x000e9;e du Kou (VK5 and VK7), where the M form is prevalent, and one village in Soumousso, primarily populated with S form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p><p>An initial high-throughput sequencing of the <italic>16S</italic> rRNA gene (variable region V4, average 23,589, s.d. 16,070 assembled reads per sample) amplified from ovaries and testes dissected from 30 mating couples produced a molecular fingerprint of the bacterial population of these reproductive tissues. Surprisingly, this analysis identified one sample, derived from the testes of an S form male collected in Soumousso, infected with <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. This sample contained 21.8% of reads (5,412 out of 24,800) matching the V4 regions of the <italic>Wolbachia 16S</italic> rRNA gene, with a percentage identity ranging between 95.3 and 97.6%. This percentage is fully consistent with the overall diversity of known <italic>Wolbachia</italic> V4 sequences (average identity 95.9%, s.d. 1.75%, median 96.0% as estimated from available sequences, see Methods), while it is incompatible with any other sequenced bacterial <italic>16S</italic> gene (closest matches at &#x0003c;89% identity). Phylogenetic analysis rooted the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences into one of the two main subtrees of the genus, further confirming their taxonomic placement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>The identification of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences in the testes of an <italic>An. gambiae</italic> male prompted us to analyse the remaining mosquito specimens collected from the same mating swarms in the three villages. To this aim, a more sensitive PCR-based amplification and sequencing of a <italic>16S</italic> rRNA gene segment comprising three variable regions (V6, V7 and V8) was utilized to specifically detect <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in ovaries and testes dissected from the remaining 51 mating couples, using previously validated primers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The mosquito carcasses were also examined using the same method. Out of the 102 mosquitoes analysed, 11 were positive for <italic>Wolbachia 16S</italic> rRNA, leading to a frequency of infection of 10.8% similarly distributed between males and females (5 males and 6 females) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences were PCR amplified from either the reproductive tissues or from the carcasses, but never from both, with the exception of one male, where <italic>16S</italic> sequences were identified by high-throughput sequencing in the testes and by PCR in the carcass. Although sequences corresponding to these endosymbionts were more prevalent in M mosquitoes, the difference in frequency between the two species was not statistically significant (12.8% in M samples compared with 4.2% in S samples). We also amplified DNA from fourth instar larvae collected from the same three villages (100 specimens from Soumousso, 80 specimens from VK5 and 70 specimens from VK7) using the same primer sets described above. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences were found in five larval samples (three from Soumousso, one from VK5 and one from VK7), suggesting occurrence of maternal transmission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences group into two different clusters</title><p>Analysis of the amplified regions determined the presence of at least two distinct clusters of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). One cluster was identical to the reference strains <italic>w</italic>AlbB isolated from <italic>A. albopictus</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, while the second was closely related to several <italic>w</italic>Pip strains isolated from <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes and <italic>Drosophila</italic> species<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The <italic>w</italic>AlbB-like cluster was detected only in reproductive tissues (ovaries and testes), while <italic>w</italic>Pip-like sequences were more widespread and were found in ovaries, carcasses and whole larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Although these <italic>Wolbachia</italic> ribosomal sequences are not host specific, the identification of two distinct clusters suggests the occurrence of independent <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, as observed in other hosts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>We next analysed the distribution of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences among the different villages. A larger number of positive individuals were isolated from mating swarms in VK5, where 7 out of the 36 collected mosquitoes showed evidence of infection (19.4%). The other 4 positive samples were found in VK7 (3 samples out of 42, 7.1%) and Soumousso (1 sample out of 24, 4.2%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Strikingly, six of the seven positive samples isolated from VK5 had been collected in just two of the seven mating swarms analysed in that village (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). If confirmed, such clustering of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive individuals in specific swarms would suggest that ecological and environmental factors might play a key role in the establishment of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections in the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> host.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>The <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain belongs to a new phylogenetic group</title><p>To expand the <italic>16S</italic> rRNA-based analysis and better characterize the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain found in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, we performed whole-genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic sequencing of two of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive samples from mosquito ovaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Sequences corresponding to the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> genome were screened out, and a pipeline for detecting <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-specific sequences based on the unique marker approach was applied<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> (see Methods). A total of 571 reads uniquely attributable to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a,b</xref>) with 86&#x000b1;3.9 and 87.0&#x000b1;4.4% average identity for the two samples analysed, which is in line with the sequence divergence observed for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains in different supergroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). These sequences matched 134 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes belonging to different functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3c</xref>). The majority of reads (32.2% on average across the two samples) matched genes from metabolic pathways, while a relevant number of reads (13.3%) corresponded to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-specific transposases; this is in line with the observation that transposases abundantly populate the genome of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains from many insects including mosquitoes (for example, transposases correspond to 8.32% of all genes annotated in the <italic>w</italic>Pip genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Alignment of our reads to eight fully or partially sequenced <italic>Wolbachia</italic> reference genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>) demonstrated that the strain identified here belongs to a potential <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific phylogenetic supergroup, distinct from the arthropod-associated and evolutionarily related supergroups A and B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref>). We henceforth call this strain <italic>w</italic>Anga.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>w</italic>Anga is maternally transmitted</title><p>The presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> DNA in the reproductive tissues of female adults prompted the question of whether these bacteria are inherited from mother to offspring, an essential prerequisite for their spread through a population. To obtain irrefutable proof of vertical transmission and estimate its efficiency, semi-gravid females were collected from houses in VK5 two seasons after the initial collections. The same sets of <italic>Wolbachia 16S</italic> fragments were identified at a frequency of 21% (19 out of 91 females), and the progenies of the 5 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-positive females that laid eggs were then analysed for infection. Occurrence of maternal transmission was detected in all progenies, with an average transmission frequency of 68% (ranging from 56 to 100%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). Taken together, these data confirm the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences over the course of 2 years and indicate occurrence of vertical transmission from mother to offspring, as normally observed in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The identification of genomic sequences from a novel <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain in two incipient species of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> over the course of different seasons suggests that anopheline mosquitoes naturally harbour these bacteria, prompting renewed efforts to exploit <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to block malaria transmission. Past attempts to identify <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in these mosquitoes may have failed due to possible methodological limitations in the detection systems used, including non-optimal DNA amplification and extraction methods, and size of the sampled mosquito population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. In addition, the newly identified <italic>w</italic>Anga strain appears to be highly divergent from <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains isolated in other insects. Indeed, our attempts to amplify by PCR two <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-specific genes commonly used in phylogenetic analyses, the <italic>wolbachia surface protein wsp</italic> and the <italic>fructose-biphosphate aldolase fbpA</italic>, were unsuccessful despite numerous attempts (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref> for primer sets used), suggesting a low degree of sequence conservation. Interestingly, in some <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains infecting <italic>C. pipiens</italic>, the <italic>wsp</italic>B gene is disrupted by the insertion of an IS256 transposon<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, which belongs to the same family of transposons identified in <italic>w</italic>Anga. Similar transposon insertions into <italic>wsp</italic> may have occurred in the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain infecting <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, compromising the amplification of this gene.</p><p>Although examples of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and insect hosts are widespread<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, two major observations strongly argue against the possibility of HGT of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences into the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> genome: (1) with one exception, evidence of infection was identified in reproductive tissues (ovaries and testes) from nine females and males but not in the carcasses dissected from the same individuals, or vice versa, ruling against a possible transfer into the mosquito chromosomes; (2) the average coverage of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in our WGS samples was lower than 0.05 &#x000d7; , which is incompatible with the three orders of magnitude higher coverage of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> genome in the same samples (&#x0003e;75 &#x000d7; ). Alternatively, HGT may have occurred into a bacterium or eukaryotic microorganism that infects the <italic>Anopheles</italic> germline and is maternally inherited from mother to progeny (based on the evidence of vertical transmission of <italic>16S</italic> sequences). Regardless of their origin, the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences identified here may still be sufficient to induce <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>like reproductive phenotypes, such as bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility, that would impact future field deployments of experimental <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.</p><p>The unexpected discovery in the mosquito germline of maternally inherited <italic>Wolbachia</italic> organisms will prompt further studies of the ecological, environmental and genetic determinants of susceptibility of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infections.

To specifically investigate and validate the prediction about the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the sample, we implemented an additional pipeline. We first integrated all <italic>16S</italic> rRNA sequences assigned to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> included in the SILVA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and NCBI repositories; we manually inspected those sequences with a &#x0003e;3% nucleotide divergence from any other <italic>Wolbachia 16S</italic>, which let us exclude five sequences that were mislabeled with close endosymbionts such as <italic>Bartonella</italic>, <italic>Rickettsia</italic> and <italic>Francisella</italic>.

Reads were uniquely attributable to <italic>Wolbachia</italic> on the basis of the concept of unique marker sequences<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, performed in four steps. First step: BowTie2 mapping against the eight <italic>Wolbachia</italic> reference genomes was performed to identify <italic>Wolbachia</italic> candidate reads. The mapping was performed with enhanced sensitivity (score-min L,-1.0,-1.0 -D 25 -R 5 -N 1 -L 12 -i S,2,0.25) to capture <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequence divergence and host specificity as assessed by ORFs&#x02019; sequence comparison among available <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The matches were also confirmed by BLASTN with word size of length 7. Second step: candidate reads coming from the small and large ribosomal units (<italic>16S</italic> rRNA and <italic>23S</italic> rRNA genes) were screened out by sequence mapping against the comprehensive ribosomal sequences in the SILVA database release 111. Third step: the remaining ribosomal-free candidate reads were mapped against the full RefSeq genomic database version 60 to identify any non-<italic>Wolbachia</italic>-specific hits using BLASTN with word size of length 7. Fourth step: on the basis of the mapping results of steps 1 and 3, the final set of reads from the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain identified in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (<italic>w</italic>Anga) was compiled selecting all reads showing &#x0003e;80% identity over &#x0003e;95&#x02009;nt to at least one <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain, and no hits longer than 80&#x02009;nt to other organisms.
