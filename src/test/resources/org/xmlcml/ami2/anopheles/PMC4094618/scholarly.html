            in insects. Herein, we comprehensively identified 55 genes involved in JH biosynthesis,
            metabolism and signaling in the silkworm (
            <i>Bombyx mori</i>) as well as 35 in 
            <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, 35 in 
            <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, 36 in 
            <i>Apis mellifera</i>, 47 in 
            <i>Tribolium castaneum</i>, and 44 in 
            <i>Danaus plexippus</i>. Comparative analysis showed that each gene involved in the early steps of the mevalonate
            (MVA) pathway, in the neuropeptide regulation of JH biosynthesis, or in JH signaling
            is a single copy in 
            <i>B. mori</i> and other surveyed insects, indicating that these JH-related pathways or steps are
            likely conserved in all surveyed insects. However, each gene participating in the
            isoprenoid branch of JH biosynthesis and JH metabolism, together with the 
            <i>FPPS</i> genes for catalyzing the final step of the MVA pathway of JH biosynthesis, exhibited
            an obvious duplication in Lepidoptera, including 
            <i>B. mori</i> and 
            <i>D. plexippus</i>. Microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that different copies of several
            JH-related genes presented expression changes that correlated with the dynamics of
            JH titer during larval growth and metamorphosis. Taken together, the findings suggest
            that duplication-derived copy variation of JH-related genes might be evolutionarily
            associated with the variation of JH types between Lepidoptera and other insect orders.
            In conclusion, our results provide useful clues for further functional analysis of
            JH-related genes in 
            <i>B. mori</i> and other insects.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In insects, the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH) is synthesized and released
            from the corpora allata (CA) and cooperates with the steroid 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)
            that is synthesized and released from the prothoracic glands to orchestrate insect
            molting, growth, metamorphosis, via stage-specific changes in the titers of these
            two endocrine hormones (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-gmb-73-2-310">Dubrovsky, 2005</span>). JH activity is elevated early in each larval instar to maintain larval shape and
            characteristics, whereas the titer of 20E is always increased at the end of each larval
            instar to trigger the transition instar from larva to larva (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-gmb-73-2-310">Bownes and Rembold, 1987</span>;

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-gmb-73-2-310">Futahashi and Fujiwara, 2008</span>). In the final larval instar, the JH titer is remarkably decreased and the 20E titer
            is increased to a very high level enough to initiate a metamorphic transition from
            larva to pupa. In addition, JH has been showed to regulate aging and reproduction
            in insects (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-gmb-73-2-310">Riddiford, 2012</span>;

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The dynamic change in JH titer is mainly modulated through biosynthetic and metabolic
            pathways that are catalyzed by different sets of endogenous enzymes (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-gmb-73-2-310">Li 
               <i>et al.</i>, 2004

               <i>et al.</i>, 2007
            </span>). As summarized in 
            <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S1</span>, JH biosynthesis involves the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the isoprenoid branch.
            The MVA pathway includes eight enzymatic steps and uses acetyl-CoA to generate farnesyl
            diphosphate (FPP) as a JH precursor. Then, the isoprenoid branch converts the FPP
            into JH through several continuous steps of oxidization and epoxidation (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-gmb-73-2-310">Kinjoh 
               <i>et al.</i>, 2007
            </span>). In addition, allatotropin (AT) and allatostatin (AS), which belong to the neuropeptide
            hormone family, promotes and inhibits, respectively, the JH biosynthesis by affecting
            CA activity (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-gmb-73-2-310">Kataoka 
               <i>et al.</i>, 1989

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-gmb-73-2-310">Bogus and Scheller, 1996</span>). Furthermore, proper nutritional signals can affect the release of AT and AS by
            the brain and further results in the activation or inhibition of JH biosynthesis (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-gmb-73-2-310">Noriega, 2004</span>). Moreover, the decrease in JH titer is controlled through its metabolism, which
            is mainly catalyzed by JH esterase (JHE), JH epoxide hydrolase (JHEH), and JH diol
            kinase (JHDK). Particularly, several genes involved in JH biosynthesis, metabolism,
            and signaling have been previously analyzed in insects (

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Deciphering JH signaling in insects has been attracting increasing attention worldwide.
            Although the nature of JH signaling has not been completely uncovered, some molecules
            have been demonstrated to be involved in JH signaling, including JH binding protein
            (JHBP), methoprene-tolerant (Met), the 20E receptor EcR, Ultraspiracle (USP), Krüppel
            homolog 1 (Kr-h1), FKBP39, and Chd64 (

            as a potential JH receptor in some insect species (

            <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and 
            <i>Bombyx mori</i>, Met paralog, germ-cell expressed (Gce) or Met2 protein functions as a partner of
            Met in modulating JH signaling (

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Intriguingly, there are eight types of natural JHs characterized in insects, including
            JH0, JHI, JHII, JHIII, JHIII skipped bisepoxide (JHSB3), JHIII bisepoxide (JHB3),
            methyl farnesoate (MF), and iso JH0 (

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-gmb-73-2-310">Daimon and Shinoda, 2013</span>). Currently, only JHIII is ubiquitous in all insects. The other four JH variants,
            including JH0, iso JH0, JHI, and JHII, have been found exclusively in Lepidoptera
            (

               <i>et al.</i>, 2013
            </span>). JHSB3 and JHB3 are specific to Hemiptera and Diptera, respectively. MF is found
            to be present in both Diptera and Coleoptera. However, little is known about how genes
            involved in JH biosynthesis, metabolism, and signaling vary among insects.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As noted above, some of the genes (referred to as JH-related genes) participating
            in JH-related pathways (biosynthesis, metabolism, and signaling) have been characterized
            in various insect species. However, with the availability of whole-genome sequence,
            the number, structure, and evolution of all JH-related genes have not yet been investigated
            and compared systematically at a genome-wide level among insects. The silkworm (
            <i>B. mori</i>) belongs to the order Lepidoptera. In this study, based on the current

               <i>B. mori</i> gene expression during metamorphosis (unpublished data), including 19 developmental

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We used the amino acid sequences of known insect JH-related genes to search against
               the predicted 
               <i>B. mori</i> proteins using the BLAST program. Initially, 55 JH-related genes were identified,
               including 34 for JH biosynthesis, 13 for JH metabolism, and eight for JH signaling
               (
               <span ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</span>). Several JH-related genes exhibited multiple copies, including 
               <i>farnesyl diphosphate synthase</i> (
               <i>FPPS</i>), 
               <i>farnesyl phosphatase</i> (

               identified JH-related genes in other insects, namely, 35 in 
               <i>D. melanogaster</i>, 35 in 
               <i>A. gambiae</i>, 36 in

               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</span>). Some JH-related genes in these five insects had at least two copies, including
               three genes (
               <i>Farnesol dehydrogenase</i> (
               <i>FOHSDR</i>), 
               <i>JHE</i>, and 
               <i>JHEH</i>) in 
               <i>D. melanogaster</i>, three (

               <i>FAMeT</i>, and 
               <i>JHE</i>)in 
               <i>A. mellifera,</i> five (
               <i>FPPase</i>, 
               <i>FOHSDR</i>, 
               <i>ALDH</i>, 
               <i>JHAMT</i>, and 
               <i>JHEH</i>) in 
               <i>T. castaneum</i>, and six (
               <i>FPPS</i>, 
               <i>FPPase</i>, 
               <i>ALDH</i>, 
               <i>FAMeT</i>, 
               <i>JHEH</i>, and 
               <i>JHDK</i>) in 
               <i>D. plexippus</i>. Moreover, the copies of several JH-related genes in these insects were distributed
               in tandem on a chromosome, including the 
               <i>JHEH</i>s in 
               <i>D. melanogaster;</i> the 
               <i>JHEHs</i> and 
               <i>FOHSDRs</i> in 
               <i>A. gambiae</i>; the 
               <i>JHAMTs</i> and 
               <i>JHEHs</i> in 
               <i>T. castaneum</i>; and the 
               <i>FPPSs</i>, 
               <i>FPPases</i>, 
               <i>FAMeTs</i>, 
               <i>JHEHs</i>, and 
               <i>JHDKs</i> in 
               <i>D. plexippus</i>. On the basis of these and similar observations in 
               <i>B. mori</i>, we speculate that the JH-related genes with multiple copies were duplicated during
               the evolution of 
               <i>B. mori</i> and other insects.

               </span>). We noted that only two 
               <i>FPPS</i> transcripts matched well with two predicted genes for 
               <i>B. mori</i>, namely,

               <i>FPPS</i> duplication in lepidopterans may have occurred after their separation from other
               insect species and before their separation from each other. However, all six

            <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</span>), indicating that the process of IPP production was conserved during insect evolution.
            Second, the 
            <i>FPPS</i> gene involved in the last step of the MVA pathway (production of JH precursor FPP)
            and all identified genes participating in the isoprenoid branch for producing JH showed
            a variation in copy number or gene class among 
            <i>B. mori</i> and other insects (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</span> and 
            <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</span>), which may be a consequence of gene duplication. In fact, JH types also varied between
            Lepidoptera and other insect orders, and more types of JH variants are present in
            Lepidoptera (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-gmb-73-2-310">Minakuchi 
               <i>et al.</i>, 2006

               <i>et al.</i>, 2013
            </span>). Thus, we speculate that the copy variation among the genes involved in the FPP
            production from IPP and in the isoprenoid branch may reflect the functional divergence
            of the associated gene products, and is likely linked to the diversity of JH types
            among insects. Our comparison raised two additional issues regarding the relationship
            between the variations in JH-related genes and in JH types. One issue is that 
            <i>FPPS</i> genes from Lepidoptera may have undergone a species-specific divergence (
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="f02">Figure 2</span>), which agrees with previous findings (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-gmb-73-2-310">Kinjoh 
               <i>et al.</i>, 2007
            </span>). Therefore, we hypothesize that FPPS-mediated enzymatic reactions may be the first
            step leading to the diversity of JH types among insects. Undoubtedly, whether all
            the predicted 
            <i>FPPS</i> genes are authentically involved in JH biosynthesis needs to be investigated by more
            enzymatic experiments. However, JHAMT and FAMeT, two enzymes involved in the methyl
            esterification of FA, were predicted in 
            <i>B. mori</i> and other insects (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</span> and 
            <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</span>). Previous studies in 
            <i>D. melanogaster</i> have reported that FAMeT was likely not involved in JH biosynthesis (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-gmb-73-2-310">Burtenshaw 
               <i>et al.</i>, 2008

               <i>et al.</i>, 2010
            </span>). However, another analysis speculated that FAMeT-mediated methyl esterification
            should exist in insects and crustaceans (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-gmb-73-2-310">Hui 
               <i>et al.</i>, 2010
            </span>). Undoubtedly, more evidence is required to resolve the controversial functions of
            FAMeTs in JH biosynthesis. Furthermore, Cyp15C1 and Cyp15A1 were confirmed to be involved
            in two routes of FA epoxidation (
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-gmb-73-2-310">Daimon and Shinoda, 2013</span>). However, several surveyed insects do not contain either Cyp15C1 or Cyp15A1 (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</span> and 
            <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</span>). Thus, additional experiments are needed to address whether both epoxidation routes
            occur in insects with no Cyp15C1 or no Cyp15A1 or whether other Cyp genes whose functions
            have yet to be identified catalyze one or the other route. Finally, all identified
            genes involved in neuropeptide regulation of JH biosynthesis existed as a single copy,
            implying that their regulatory mechanism is also conserved among insects.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The metabolic degradation of JH is catalyzed mainly by JHE, JHEH, and JHDK. Our results
            showed that each of the genes encoding these three enzymes may have undergone duplication
            in Lepidoptera (
            <span ref-type="table" rid="t02">Table 2</span> and 
            <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">Table S2</span>). In particular, 
            <i>JHDK</i> has multiple copies in Lepidoptera but one copy in the other surveyed insects. Given
            the existence of more JH types in Lepidoptera, we propose that, as was true of copy
            variation among several JH biosynthesis-related genes, the duplication and divergence
            of JH metabolism-related genes may also be a functionally adaptive evolution to the
            diversity of JH types in insects.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Given that multiple copies were predicted for several genes involved in JH biosynthesis
            and metabolism, it was important to determine whether these copies were functional.
            Our microarray data and quantitative RT-PCR experiments in 
            <i>B. mori</i> showed that some copies of the JH-related genes exhibited moderate expression in
            the head (mainly containing CA, CC, and brain) or in a dynamic manner that correlated
            with the temporal changes in JH titer, such as

            <i>JHAMT</i> gene has also been verified to be activated functionally in JH biosynthesis in 
            <i>T. castaneum</i> (Minakuchi and Riddiford, 2008). Furthermore, most enzyme-encoding genes with multiple
            copies appear to be expressed in other larval tissues excluding head (mainly containing
            CA, CC, and brain), during developmental stages with no JH activities, or in one or
            other sex (

            in other physiological processes. Nevertheless, further enzymatic activity assays
            are undoubtedly required to assess whether multiple copies of the JH-related genes
            encode authentic enzymes involved in JH biosynthesis and metabolism or encode proteins

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In summary, we first performed a systematic identification of the genes involved in
            JH biosynthesis, metabolism, and signaling in insects, including two lepidopterans
            (
            <i>B. mori</i> and 
            <i>D. plexippus</i>), two dipterans (
            <i>D. melanogaster</i> and 
            <i>A. gambiae</i>), one hymenopteran (
            <i>A. mellifera</i>), and one coleopteran (
            <i>T. castaneum</i>). A comparative analysis concluded that the early steps of the MVA pathway and neuro-peptide
            regulation of JH biosynthesis, as well as JH signaling, are apparently conserved among
            
            <i>B. mori</i> and other surveyed insects. However, most genes involved in the last step of the
            MVA pathway and the isoprenoid branch of JH biosynthesis, as well as JH metabolism,
            seem to have undergone duplication, resulting in multiple copies in Lepidoptera. This
            duplication may be functionally and evolutionarily relevant to the variation of JH
            types among Lepidoptera and other insect species. Although some copies of several
            JH-related multi-copy genes show a specific spatio-temporal expression correlated
            to JH activity in 
            <i>B. mori</i>, it remains to be confirmed whether their enzymatic activities are associated with
            JH biosynthesis and metabolism. Taken together, the results of our analysis provide
            new clues for understanding the genetic basis of JH bio-synthesis, metabolism, and
            signaling in insects.
