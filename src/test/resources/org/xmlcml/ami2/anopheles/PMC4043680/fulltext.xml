Briefly, the village of Dielmo (13&#x000b0;43&#x02032;N, 16&#x000b0;24&#x02032;W) is located 280 km southeast of Dakar and about 15 km north of the Gambian border in an area of Sudan-type savannah. About 500 inhabitants are living in the village. Rainfall occurs during a four-month period, from mid-June to mid-October. Dielmo is situated on the marshy bank of a small permanent stream, with anopheles breeding sites present all year round. During the second week of July 2008, all villagers were offered long-lasting deltamethrin-treated nets (LLINs) (Permanet 2.0). Household visits were conducted quarterly to confirm ownership and to monitor their use and condition. During these household visits, ownership of bednets in the study population after the implementation of LLINs was respectively 97.7% in 2008 and 95.6 in 2011. LLINs of all villagers were renewed in July 2011 after we documented a rebound in malaria morbidity. There were no LLINs in Dielmo before July 2008.

Night human landing catches (HLC) were conducted two or three nights each month, between 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM, in two indoor and two outdoor sites. In each site, two trained collectors (adult male volunteers) worked alternatively for one hour and rested for one hour. Pyrethroid spray catches (PCS) were performed at 7:00 AM by spraying Deltamethrin (Yotox) for 30&#x02013;45 seconds in a room. After 10 minutes, dead and immobilized mosquitoes were collected. Anopheline identification was performed following morphologic identification keys <xref rid="pone.0097700-Gillies1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

A series of adaptative processes were observed in the <italic>An. gambiae s.l</italic>. population after mass deployment of LLINs inside houses. Firstly, mosquitoes that remained susceptible to insecticide had a marked decreased lifespan after LLINs implementation. In the following years, they tended to adapt by shifting to outdoors host seeking, by biting earlier and increasing feeding on animals. Secondly, insecticide-treated nets quickly selected resistant mosquitoes with long lifespan and unchanged feeding behaviour. This change in species composition following LLINs implementation has been previously noted for <italic>An. arabiensis</italic><xref rid="pone.0097700-Mutuku1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097700-Russell2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> and likely reflects its known opportunistic host choice, feeding on both humans and animals.

Unlike <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, <italic>An. funestus</italic> in Dielmo did not present kdr mutation but rather behavioural changes on biting hours with peaks of maximum aggressiveness in broad daylight between 07:00 and 11:00 AM <xref rid="pone.0097700-Sougoufara1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The selection of resistant specimens by the use of insecticide-treated materials has already been widely reported <xref rid="pone.0097700-Czeher1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097700-Vulule1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. This study demonstrates that the R allelic frequency rose shortly after the implementation of LLINs and continued to increase three years later. The presence of the kdr mutation has been shown to be associated with a reduced susceptibility to pyrethroids and DDT <xref rid="pone.0097700-Ndiath1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> although other resistance mechanisms should also be taken into account.</p><p>On the other hand, changes in feeding time following the use of LLINs have already been observed in other studies, reporting either a shift to early feeding, just after sunset or to morning feeding just before sunrise <xref rid="pone.0097700-Fornadel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097700-Russell1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097700-Sougoufara1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Our study demonstrates that changes in aggressiveness exclusively involved the SS genotype sub-group that is potentially the most susceptible to insecticide. Equally, as previously demonstrated in other studies <xref rid="pone.0097700-Magesa1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097700-Russell2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the presence of insecticide treated materials inside houses decreased mosquito lifespan in the years following their implementation. Our study shows that this reduction was particularly important in kdr SS specimens that were the most susceptible to insecticide. However, parity rates remained constant in the RR kdr genotype, demonstrating the lack of insecticide killing effect in this group. In the past few years, even kdr SS specimens have a high parity rate. This may be explained by the selection of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> specimens having acquired other mechanism of resistance, different from kdr mutation <xref rid="pone.0097700-Ndiath1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The longer lifespan in RR specimens may explain the high CSP rate observed in this group. This would suggest that adaptative mechanisms to insecticide have promoted survival to the detriment of reproduction, leading to few but highly infectious females.</p><p>Shift from endophagic to more exophagic host seeking behaviour in <italic>An. gambiae s.l.</italic> has been reported in various studies after the implementation of insecticide-treated materials inside houses <xref rid="pone.0097700-Fornadel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097700-Reddy1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In the present work, the mass use of LLINs have been associated with increased exophagic behaviour, especially in species with opportunistic feeding behaviour such as <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> and in the most susceptible to insecticide such as SS mosquitoes. All these data demonstrate that insecticide susceptible mosquitoes adapted to the presence of LLINs inside houses by feeding more on animals. These changes occur in <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> that is known to have an opportunistic feeding behaviour <xref rid="pone.0097700-Lemasson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> but also in <italic>An. gambiae s.s.</italic> which is remarkable and demonstrates its outstanding adaptiveness.</p><p>Although the decreased infection rate in vectors after implementation of LLINs has already been reported <xref rid="pone.0097700-Russell2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097700-Shaukat1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, this study is, to our knowledge, the first to identify subgroups inside <italic>An</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> complex that displays opposite behaviour regarding infection. Indeed, since the implementation of LLINs, infection rates dropped in SS and RS groups but significantly increased in the RR group that is now almost the only <italic>P. falciparum</italic> vector and plays a key role in the rebound of malaria morbidity observed in this population <xref rid="pone.0097700-Trape2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>Whereas malaria-related morbidity dropped in the year following the implementation of LLINs <xref rid="pone.0097700-Trape2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, a reservoir of gametocyte carriers was still available for mosquitoes' infection.

Data analysis suggests that the choice of ACT used for first-line treatment and the universal deployment of LLINs were the most important factors governing the dramatic changes in anopheles populations and malaria morbidity. We hypothesize that these gametocytemia associated with clinical attacks may be more infectious to mosquitoes than those associated with asymptomatic infections. This could therefore explain maintenance of significant levels of transmission <xref rid="pone.0097700-Trape4" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the rapidly increasing insecticide resistant vector population and its almost exclusive responsibility in malaria transmission, the gametocyte reservoir continued to decrease three years after the deployment of LLINs.
