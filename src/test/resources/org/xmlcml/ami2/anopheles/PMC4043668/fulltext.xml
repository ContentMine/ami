To understand perceptual categorization of objects by these spiders, we investigated their predatory behavior toward different digital stimuli - abstract &#x02018;stick figure&#x02019; representations of <italic>Anopheles</italic> constructed solely by known key identification elements, disarranged versions of these, as well as non-prey items and detailed images of alternative prey. We hypothesized that the abstract images representing <italic>Anopheles</italic> would be perceived as potential prey, and would be preferred to those of non-preferred prey. Spiders perceived the abstract stick figures of <italic>Anopheles</italic> specifically as their preferred prey, attacking them significantly more often than non-preferred prey, even when the comprising elements of the <italic>Anopheles</italic> stick figures were disarranged and disconnected from each other. However, if the relative angles between the elements of the disconnected stick figures of <italic>Anopheles</italic> were altered, the otherwise identical set of elements was no longer perceived as prey. These data show that <italic>E. culicivora</italic> is capable of making discriminations based on abstract concepts, such as the hypothetical angle formed by discontinuous elements. It is this inter-element angle rather than resting posture that is important for correct identification of <italic>Anopheles</italic>. Our results provide a glimpse of the underlying processes of object recognition in animals with minute brains, and suggest that these spiders use a local processing approach for object recognition, rather than a holistic or global approach. This study provides an excellent basis for a comparative analysis on feature extraction and detection by animals as diverse as bees and mammals.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund to XJN (M1149).

The process leading to recognition is typically, though not exclusively, viewed as a bottom-up hierarchy in which information is processed sequentially with increasing complexity. In vertebrates, the idea is that lower-level cortical processors, such as the primary visual cortex, process the basic object components such as color, depth and form, while higher-level cortical processors, such as the inferotemporal cortex in humans, are ultimately responsible for recognition <xref rid="pone.0097819-Bar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Historically, perhaps one of the best-known attempts at explaining perception and recognition is that of Gestalt psychology.</p><p>The central tenet of Gestalt psychology is that the whole differs from the sum of its parts. The theoretical framework underlying Gestalt ideas is holism, which states that systems and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of parts <xref rid="pone.0097819-Wagemans1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This contrasts with earlier structuralist hypotheses, which state that perceptions can be derived by identifying the elementary parts <xref rid="pone.0097819-Rock1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Frster1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Modern research into visual processing has changed its focus from gestaltism vs. structuralism to global vs. local processing <xref rid="pone.0097819-Frster1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Kimchi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, with an expanded focus from the psychological processes of perception to include physiological processes <xref rid="pone.0097819-Heinze1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The global processing framework results in the notion that an object is recognized only when its elements form the whole image, while the local processing framework requires the identification of correct elements, points and edges, but not necessarily the image as a whole. This distinction also suggests potential differences in the neurobiological processes underlying object recognition <xref rid="pone.0097819-Heinze1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>For a predator that relies on vision, visual ability to classify an object as predator or prey will be under strong selection. However, the extent to which visual predators further classify items can vary considerably. Some predators make rapid decisions and do minimal classifying of prey into particular types, relying instead on key features, such as seeing an object of a specific size range moving in a specific orientation, as identifiers of prey <xref rid="pone.0097819-Barlow1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Ewert2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Examples of this approach can be found among amphibians <xref rid="pone.0097819-Ewert2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Ingle1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> and mantises <xref rid="pone.0097819-Prete1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, which adopt remarkably similar approaches despite possessing very different nervous systems. Many jumping spiders (Salticidae) also rapidly categorize objects as prey or non-prey based on only a few key features <xref rid="pone.0097819-Drees1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Forster1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, it is also amongst the salticids that some of the most precise prey identification and prey preference behaviors among animals is found.</p><p>An extreme case of such preference is that of <italic>Evarcha culicivora</italic>. Uniquely, this East African salticid feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selectively preying upon female mosquitoes (particularly <italic>Anopheles</italic>, famous as the vectors of malaria) that have recently fed on blood. These spiders are capable of using vision alone to discriminate between their preferred prey, blood-fed female <italic>Anopheles,</italic> and similar looking male <italic>Anopheles</italic>, female <italic>Anopheles</italic> that have not fed on blood, non-anopheline mosquitoes, as well as various similar-sized non-mosquito prey <xref rid="pone.0097819-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Jackson2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. These experiments have also shown that for correct identification <italic>E. culicivora</italic> uses a complex non-linear process involving specific elements of the prey, including an engorged abdomen, resting posture and antennae <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Like other salticids, <italic>E. culicivora</italic> has exceptional eyesight, which is used to locate, stalk and finally pounce on its prey <xref rid="pone.0097819-Jackson3" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Salticids have large forward-facing principal eyes that are specialized for high resolution vision but within a very narrow (ca. &#x0003c;5&#x000b0;) field of view <xref rid="pone.0097819-Land1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Blest1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> which is compensated for with complex movements that scan up to ca. 28&#x000b0; to either side of the body axis <xref rid="pone.0097819-Land3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Here we presented the spiders with abstract representations of potential prey (&#x02018;stick figures&#x02019;) differing in their level of simplicity to determine whether predatory behavior and prey classification was elicited by biologically unrealistic prey containing only key elements (local processing). Stimuli included stick figures of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes in their resting posture, as well as non-prey items and alternative prey items. We used single-choice predatory behavior experiments to determine whether or not <italic>E. culicivora</italic> &#x02018;viewed&#x02019; abstract representations of prey as potential prey, and two-choice predatory behavior experiments to test for specific preference between stimuli. Due to <italic>E. culicivora</italic>&#x02019;s known ability to discern specific elements of prey, we predicted that these specialized visual hunters would stalk and pounce on abstract representations of prey. We also predicted that <italic>E. culicivora</italic> would choose simplified representations of its preferred prey over realistic images of alternative non-preferred prey, showing that it categorizes these images as its preferred prey item.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>a. Do Jumping Spiders View Abstract Images of Prey Elements as Prey?</title><p>A total of 195 successful sessions were run in the single-choice predatory behaviour experiment: 85 with adult females, 50 with adult males and 60 with juvenile spiders. When spiders initiated stalking behavior, this almost always resulted in pouncing on the abstract prey (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097819.s001">Table S1</xref>).

By using stick figure drawings of their preferred prey &#x02013; <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, we have created stimuli constructed only of key elements of their prey that have been found to be important for recognition <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. As hypothesized, we have shown that not only do these spiders view these stimuli as potential prey (by initiating predatory behavior), but they also prefer these abstract images of prey to detailed images of alternative non-preferred prey. These results show that the various elements that have been found to be necessary for prey discrimination in previous studies are <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> also sufficient for recognition. This was the case regardless of whether or not the spiders had encountered their preferred prey before. Our controls have ruled out external cues, such as side preference, number of elements of the stimulus, and the relative contrast of the stimuli. Interestingly, the propensity to pounce was not affected by the different stimuli, and was seen in almost all cases where stalking was initiated. It would seem that the decision to pounce relies on other cues not singled out in this study, or, perhaps more likely, that pouncing is a follow-up behavior akin to a &#x02018;fixed action pattern&#x02019;.</p><p>Our confidence in these results is strengthened by the behavior of the na&#x000ef;ve juveniles in the single-choice predatory behavior experiment. When hunting <italic>Anopheles</italic>, but no other type of prey, juveniles of <italic>E. culicivora</italic> perform an innate prey-specific predatory behavior involving a detour to approach the prey from behind <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This detouring approach to the prey was evident in 57% of the trials involving a stimulus representing an <italic>Anopheles</italic> (stimuli 1&#x02013;4; N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;31; stimulus 1 (detours/attacks): 7/11; stimulus 2: 4/9; stimulus 3: 6/10; stimulus 4: 1/1) with juveniles, but only once with the fly stimulus (stimulus 5; N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) and never with the circle stimulus (stimulus 6; N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3). Despite these small sample sizes, it is apparent that they recognize the stick-figure stimuli specifically as <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes.</p><p>The low level categorization of the abstract stimuli into prey and non-prey items is also seen in other invertebrates such as the praying mantis, where basic features of the stimuli, including size and speed, are the main cues <xref rid="pone.0097819-Prete1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Prete2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, <italic>E. culicivora</italic>&#x02019;s discriminations use much finer details of an image, such of the size and shape of mosquito antennae, when making decisions regarding preference <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and thus require a considerably higher level of feature detection. The most notable instance of such discrimination in this study was the ability of the spiders to discriminate between the two disarranged stimuli in the single-choice predatory behavior experiment, where the only difference between the stimuli were the relative angles between the elements and yet one was categorized as prey, while the other was not. Nelson and Jackson <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> have shown that the resting posture of a mosquito is an important cue for recognition. Our findings fine-tune those conclusions by suggesting that it is not the angle of the body compared to a surface or horizon, but rather the relative angles between the body elements that is crucial for recognition.</p><p>Discrimination of orientation has been shown in honeybees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>), which can distinguish different orientations even when these are produced through illusory contours <xref rid="pone.0097819-VanHateren1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and without clear edge detection <xref rid="pone.0097819-Horridge1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Horridge <xref rid="pone.0097819-Horridge2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Horridge3" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> proposed that the generalization ability of the honeybee uses different parameters of an image to form local cues. These discrimination mechanisms were based on physical aspects of an image, but Avargues-Weber et al. <xref rid="pone.0097819-AvarguesWeber1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-AvarguesWeber2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> demonstrated that honeybees are even capable of abstract concepts such as above-below and left-right. Unlike in the bee studies, we used unlearned stimuli and untrained animals, and show that <italic>E. culicivora</italic> is capable of discrimination using a significantly more complex abstract concept - angles between disconnected elements.</p><p>One way of achieving such discrimination ability is by storing the &#x02018;correct&#x02019; orientation of the various elements and comparing each element to stored memory. However, the spiders occasionally pounced upon the stimulus while standing on the sides or the ceiling of the starting chamber (analogous to behavior common in a natural setting, XJN pers. obs.), suggesting that orientation effects do not play a role in these decisions. While it is tempting to consider this type of object consistency in recognition to be superior to that seen in human recognition of faces (where face recognition is degraded significantly more than other objects when viewed upside-down <xref rid="pone.0097819-Yin1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Piepers1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>), there is an inherent difference between the two - faces often have a prototypical orientation, while in the spider&#x02019;s natural three-dimensional environment prey is often viewed from different orientations.</p><p>An alternative mechanism of achieving the discrimination ability seen in this study is by &#x02018;calculating&#x02019; the relative difference of the angles and comparing that to stored angles that represent prey. While discrimination of orientation has been well studied in vertebrates and invertebrates <xref rid="pone.0097819-Appelle1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Srinivasan1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, relative angle discrimination in non-human animals remains largely unstudied. In humans, however, this ability has been well studied (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0097819-Marr1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>) and there is some evidence for a neural mechanism that encodes angles in humans <xref rid="pone.0097819-Regan1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, as well as in macaques <xref rid="pone.0097819-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> and cats <xref rid="pone.0097819-Shevelev1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that <italic>E. culicivora</italic> not only categorizes the simplified abstract stimuli as prey, but recognizes them as its preferred prey, exhibiting higher level categorization or within-category discrimination. This was the case even for the disarranged version of the blood-fed <italic>Anopheles</italic>, a capability not dissimilar to that of humans with visual expertise when viewing fragmented images of cars or faces <xref rid="pone.0097819-Harel1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, although in our case the images were abstract and dispersed rather than fragmented. <italic>E. culicivora</italic> not showing any preference between the blood-fed <italic>Anopheles</italic> stimulus and its disarranged version was perhaps the most surprising finding of this study. While it is possible that <italic>E. culicivora&#x02019;s</italic> response to the image of the disarranged <italic>Anopheles</italic> was due to its resemblance to some other unknown prey rather than <italic>Anopheles</italic>, this is unlikely as the dietary preferences of these spiders has been well studied <xref rid="pone.0097819-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. We should note that experiments using stimuli 4 and 7 were both run at a later date. While this too might have affected the results, this also seems unlikely, as the laboratory conditions were constant and the spiders were healthy. Another alternative explanation is that the specific arrangement of the elements of the disarranged <italic>Anopheles</italic> exploits a sensory bias in the <italic>E. culicivora&#x02019;s</italic> visual pathways, while the altered version of this stimulus does not. Regrettably, we could not test the spider&#x02019;s responses to other alternative arrangements of these stimuli. Nonetheless, either through a sensory bias in the visual pathways, or by higher level visual analysis, the spiders evidently categorized both the blood-fed <italic>Anopheles</italic> stimulus and its disarranged version as their preferred prey. This suggests that they do not use a global, or holistic approach to recognition <xref rid="pone.0097819-Rock1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Piepers1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, but rely instead on the analysis of specific elements at a local level to recognize an object <xref rid="pone.0097819-Frster1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097819-Heinze1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

A closer look at how these spiders visually analyze what it is they are seeing will provide a deeper understanding of what specific features these spiders are looking for when they are looking for prey.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>a.

The ramp was wiped with 80% ethanol and allowed to dry for 15 min between each test to eliminate possible chemotactile traces from spiders in previous tests.</p><fig id="pone-0097819-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0097819.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Experimental apparatuses used.</title><p>a) Apparatus used in single-choice predatory behavior experiment.

These distances were used as they are far enough from the screen so that the spiders couldn&#x02019;t &#x02018;wald&#x02019; directly onto the stimuli, while being close enough to enhance the chances of the spiders reacting to the stimuli (juveniles were less responsive to stimuli at a distance compared to adults). The screen was covered with a piece of black cardboard until test spiders were released to prevent them seeing the stimulus until tests began. Once the spiders were relaxed (staying stationary or grooming) the screen was uncovered, the petri dish was removed and timing started. Tests ended when the spiders pounced on an image or walked/jumped off the ramp. If a spider noticed the image, the session was considered successful and tests were not repeated with the same spider. A spider that failed to notice the stimulus was tested up to twice in one day, or up to a total of 4 times in the following 3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>d. Do Jumping Spiders View Abstract Images as their Preferred Prey?</title><p>In this experiment we relied on <italic>E. culicivora&#x02019;</italic>s proven preference for <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes and presented them with a two-choice test. All spiders used in this test were laboratory reared and had no prior experience with mosquitoes. For these tests, rendered movies contained two images (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097819-t001">Table 1</xref>) which moved identically and simultaneously. In each test, which image was on the right and which was on the left was randomized. The movies were projected as above, but experiments were held within a specialized apparatus containing a stainless steel ramp (15 mm wide&#x000d7;150 mm long; angled up by 25<bold>&#x000b0;</bold>) in front of the screen. The ramp was inside a glass chamber (diameter 300 mm, length 525 mm long) with removable sealing steel end plates (diameter 200 mm, kept off during this set of experiments). Welded to the ramp was a bracket onto which the screen was attached with a gap of 5 mm from the ramp. The ramp/screen unit (&#x02018;ramp complex&#x02019;) sat mounted within holes on a stainless steel platform spanning the length of the cylinder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097819-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). In this way it could be removed for cleaning with 80% ethanol after each test and returned to the same place, while ensuring that the distance between the screen and the reducing lens and projector was always the same (and thus stimulus size was constant).</p><p>At a distance of 22 mm from the end of the ramp, a stainless steel &#x02018;starting box&#x02019; (11 mm wide&#x000d7;19 mm high&#x000d7;22 mm deep; i.e., furthest point 44 mm from top end of ramp) was welded to the ramp complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097819-g002">Figure 2b</xref>). The box had a transparent Plexiglas cover wired to an external controller so that it could be opened remotely. The spider was placed into the starting box and the door was closed. After 2 min, the ramp complex was put in place. Once the spider was away from the door of the starting box, after ca. 20 s, the door was opened and tests began. Tests ended with the spider pouncing on one of the two images on the screen or to jumping/walking off the ramp. Failing these two conditions, tests were stopped after 15 min. In this experiment we were interested in pouncing &#x000ff;ehavior rather than instalking &#x000ff;ehavior, as the former constitutes a more distinct choice by the spiders. For this reason, both adult and juvenile spiders were released a short distance from the screen (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097819.s013">Video S2</xref> for a sample of the spider behavior in this experiment).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>e. Data Analysis</title><p>All analyses were done using SPSS Statistics v.20. For the single-choice predatory behavior experiment, GLM analyses were performed to check for the main effects of stimulus type, &#x02018;sex&#x02019;, relative contrast (number of black pixels against a white background) which was either in the ca. 200 or ca. 500 pixels) and their interaction on the spider&#x02019;s choice to stalk the stimuli. Interactions between stimulus relative contrast and stimulus type were not analyzed, as these are nested. Sexes were divided into three &#x02013; female, male and juvenile as their sex cannot be discerned and their behavior differs <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097819-Nelson3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this model the dispersion parameter was set at 1, and type III sums of squares were used, though there was no qualitative difference from type I. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the predatory responses between the different sexes, with Mann-Whitney U tests for pairwise analysis. Cochran&#x02019;s Q tests were used to test how the different stimuli affected the chances of the spiders noticing the stimulus and the propensity to stalk and pounce. Friedman tests were used to test the effects of the different stimuli on stalking initiation distance, as well as their effects on the amount of time it took the spiders to start stalking. When these effects were found to be significant, McNemar tests were used for pairwise comparisons. For the two-choice predatory behavior experiments, Binomial tests were used to test the spider&#x02019;s choices, as well as possible side-bias.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0097819.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p><bold>Results from the single-choice predatory behavior experiment (all spiders).</bold> M &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; Median, IQR &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; interquartile range.
