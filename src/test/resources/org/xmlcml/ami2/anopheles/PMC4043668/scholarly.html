         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The East African jumping spider 
            <i>Evarcha culicivora</i> feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by preferentially preying upon blood-fed 
            <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes, the vectors of human malaria
            <sup>1</sup>, using the distinct resting posture and engorged abdomen characteristic of these
            specific prey as key elements for their recognition. To understand perceptual categorization
            of objects by these spiders, we investigated their predatory behavior toward different
            digital stimuli - abstract ‘stick figure’ representations of 
            <i>Anopheles</i> constructed solely by known key identification elements, disarranged versions of
            these, as well as non-prey items and detailed images of alternative prey. We hypothesized
            that the abstract images representing 
            <i>Anopheles</i> would be perceived as potential prey, and would be preferred to those of non-preferred
            prey. Spiders perceived the abstract stick figures of 
            <i>Anopheles</i> specifically as their preferred prey, attacking them significantly more often than
            non-preferred prey, even when the comprising elements of the 
            <i>Anopheles</i> stick figures were disarranged and disconnected from each other. However, if the
            relative angles between the elements of the disconnected stick figures of 
            <i>Anopheles</i> were altered, the otherwise identical set of elements was no longer perceived as
            prey. These data show that 
            <i>E. culicivora</i> is capable of making discriminations based on abstract concepts, such as the hypothetical
            angle formed by discontinuous elements. It is this inter-element angle rather than
            resting posture that is important for correct identification of 
            <i>Anopheles</i>. Our results provide a glimpse of the underlying processes of object recognition
            in animals with minute brains, and suggest that these spiders use a local processing
            approach for object recognition, rather than a holistic or global approach. This study
            provides an excellent basis for a comparative analysis on feature extraction and detection
            by animals as diverse as bees and mammals.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Object recognition is the ability to perceive the physical properties (such as shape,
            color and texture) of an object and apply semantic/cognitive attributes to the object
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Enns1">[1]</span>, such as an understanding of its use, or classification of the object as prey, predator
            or irrelevant. The process leading to recognition is typically, though not exclusively,
            viewed as a bottom-up hierarchy in which information is processed sequentially with
            increasing complexity. In vertebrates, the idea is that lower-level cortical processors,
            such as the primary visual cortex, process the basic object components such as color,
            depth and form, while higher-level cortical processors, such as the inferotemporal
            cortex in humans, are ultimately responsible for recognition 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Bar1">[2]</span>. Historically, perhaps one of the best-known attempts at explaining perception and
            recognition is that of Gestalt psychology.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The central tenet of Gestalt psychology is that the whole differs from the sum of
            its parts. The theoretical framework underlying Gestalt ideas is holism, which states
            that systems and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not as collections of
            parts 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Wagemans1">[3]</span>. This contrasts with earlier structuralist hypotheses, which state that perceptions
            can be derived by identifying the elementary parts 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Rock1">[4]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Frster1">[6]</span>. Modern research into visual processing has changed its focus from gestaltism vs.
            structuralism to global vs. local processing 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Frster1">[6]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Kimchi1">[7]</span>, with an expanded focus from the psychological processes of perception to include
            physiological processes 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Heinze1">[8]</span>. The global processing framework results in the notion that an object is recognized
            only when its elements form the whole image, while the local processing framework
            requires the identification of correct elements, points and edges, but not necessarily
            the image as a whole. This distinction also suggests potential differences in the
            neurobiological processes underlying object recognition 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Heinze1">[8]</span>.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For a predator that relies on vision, visual ability to classify an object as predator
            or prey will be under strong selection. However, the extent to which visual predators
            further classify items can vary considerably. Some predators make rapid decisions
            and do minimal classifying of prey into particular types, relying instead on key features,
            such as seeing an object of a specific size range moving in a specific orientation,
            as identifiers of prey 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Barlow1">[9]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Ewert2">[12]</span>. Examples of this approach can be found among amphibians 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Ewert2">[12]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Ingle1">[13]</span> and mantises 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Prete1">[14]</span>, which adopt remarkably similar approaches despite possessing very different nervous
            systems. Many jumping spiders (Salticidae) also rapidly categorize objects as prey
            or non-prey based on only a few key features 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Drees1">[15]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Forster1">[18]</span>. However, it is also amongst the salticids that some of the most precise prey identification
            and prey preference behaviors among animals is found.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">An extreme case of such preference is that of 
            <i>Evarcha culicivora</i>. Uniquely, this East African salticid feeds indirectly on vertebrate blood by selectively
            preying upon female mosquitoes (particularly 
            <i>Anopheles</i>, famous as the vectors of malaria) that have recently fed on blood. These spiders
            are capable of using vision alone to discriminate between their preferred prey, blood-fed
            female 
            <i>Anopheles,</i> and similar looking male 
            <i>Anopheles</i>, female 
            <i>Anopheles</i> that have not fed on blood, non-anopheline mosquitoes, as well as various similar-sized
            non-mosquito prey 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Jackson1">[19]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Jackson2">[21]</span>. These experiments have also shown that for correct identification 
            <i>E. culicivora</i> uses a complex non-linear process involving specific elements of the prey, including
            an engorged abdomen, resting posture and antennae 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1">[20]</span>,

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Like other salticids, 
            <i>E. culicivora</i> has exceptional eyesight, which is used to locate, stalk and finally pounce on its
            prey 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Jackson3">[23]</span>. Salticids have large forward-facing principal eyes that are specialized for high
            resolution vision but within a very narrow (ca. &lt;5°) field of view

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Blest1">[28]</span> which is compensated for with complex movements that scan up to ca. 28° to either
            side of the body axis 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Land3">[27]</span>. Additionally, salticids have three pairs of motion-sensitive secondary eyes with
            wide fields of view and which collectively encompass up to 360°

            <i>E. culicivora</i>’s unique dietary preferences, which can be expressed using vision as the sole sensory
            modality for prey classification

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2">[22]</span>, make this species an excellent subject for the study of recognition and classification
            of prey. Here we presented the spiders with abstract representations of potential
            prey (‘stick figures’) differing in their level of simplicity to determine whether
            predatory behavior and prey classification was elicited by biologically unrealistic
            prey containing only key elements (local processing). Stimuli included stick figures
            of 
            <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes in their resting posture, as well as non-prey items and alternative prey
            items. We used single-choice predatory behavior experiments to determine whether or
            not 
            <i>E. culicivora</i> ‘viewed’ abstract representations of prey as potential prey, and two-choice predatory
            behavior experiments to test for specific preference between stimuli. Due to 
            <i>E. culicivora</i>’s known ability to discern specific elements of prey, we predicted that these specialized
            visual hunters would stalk and pounce on abstract representations of prey. We also
            predicted that 
            <i>E. culicivora</i> would choose simplified representations of its preferred prey over realistic images
            of alternative non-preferred prey, showing that it categorizes these images as its
            preferred prey item.

            <h3>a. Do Jumping Spiders View Abstract Images of Prey Elements as Prey?</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A total of 195 successful sessions were run in the single-choice predatory behaviour
               experiment: 85 with adult females, 50 with adult males and 60 with juvenile spiders.
               When spiders initiated stalking behavior, this almost always resulted in pouncing
               on the abstract prey (
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097819.s001">Table S1</span>). The type of stimulus had no effect on whether the spiders noticed it (χ
               <sup>2</sup> = 6.71, df = 6, p = 0.349, 
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097819.s002">Table S2</span>). Stimulus type did affect the propensity to stalk the prey once it was noticed (χ
               <sup>2</sup> = 37.87, df = 6, p&lt;0.001), but did not affect the amount of time it took the spiders
               to ‘decide’ to stalk the prey (time between the spider first noticing the stimulus
               and initiation of stalking behavior; χ
               <sup>2</sup> = 3.928, df = 6; p = 0.686, 
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097819.s002">Table S2</span>). Once stalking was initiated, stimulus type had no effect on the propensity to pounce
               (χ
               <sup>2</sup> = 4, df = 6, p = 0.677, 
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097819.s002">Table S2</span>). We therefore considered stalking to be a true sign of predatory behavior by the
               spiders. The spiders stalked the abstract images of mosquitoes (stimuli 1, 2, 3 and
               4) significantly more often than the images of non-prey items (stimuli 6 and 7; 
               <span ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097819-t001">Table 1</span>). However, while the image of the fly (stimulus 5) was stalked significantly more
               often than the altered, disarranged abstract image of the blood-fed mosquito (stimulus
               7), it wasn’t stalked more often than the image of the circle (stimulus 6).

            <h3>b. Do Jumping Spiders View Abstract Images as their Preferred Prey?</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A total of 123 successful sessions were run in the two-choice predatory behaviour
               experiments, 61 with females, 34 with males and 28 with juveniles. Spiders never exhibited
               a side bias (experiments 1 through 5, respectively: p = 0.23; p = 0.83; p = 0.35;
               p = 0.54; p = 0.54, Binomial test). When given a choice between abstract representations
               of their preferred prey and a realistic image of non-preferred prey (a house fly),
               
               <i>E. culicivora</i> chose the preferred prey significantly more often (experiments 1 and 2 respectively,
               p&lt;0.001; p&lt;0.01, Binomial test, 
               <span ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097819-t002">Table 2</span>). Spiders also chose a disarranged abstract representation of their preferred prey
               significantly more often than they chose a realistic image of non-preferred prey (experiment

               <span ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097819-t002">Table 2</span>), or a disarranged non-prey item (experiment 5, p&lt;0.05, Binomial test, 
               <span ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097819-t002">Table 2</span>). However, spiders showed no preference when presented with an abstract representation
               of their preferred prey and a disarranged version of that same image (experiment 4,

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This study shows that for 
            <i>E. culicivora,</i> discrimination and categorization can be achieved using only visual representations
            of the basic elements of its preferred prey. By using stick figure drawings of their
            preferred prey – 
            <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes, we have created stimuli constructed only of key elements of their prey
            that have been found to be important for recognition 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1">[20]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2">[22]</span>. As hypothesized, we have shown that not only do these spiders view these stimuli
            as potential prey (by initiating predatory behavior), but they also prefer these abstract
            images of prey to detailed images of alternative non-preferred prey. These results
            show that the various elements that have been found to be necessary for prey discrimination
            in previous studies are 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1">[20]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2">[22]</span> also sufficient for recognition. This was the case regardless of whether or not the
            spiders had encountered their preferred prey before. Our controls have ruled out external
            cues, such as side preference, number of elements of the stimulus, and the relative
            contrast of the stimuli. Interestingly, the propensity to pounce was not affected
            by the different stimuli, and was seen in almost all cases where stalking was initiated.
            It would seem that the decision to pounce relies on other cues not singled out in
            this study, or, perhaps more likely, that pouncing is a follow-up behavior akin to
            a ‘fixed action pattern’.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our confidence in these results is strengthened by the behavior of the naïve juveniles
            in the single-choice predatory behavior experiment. When hunting 
            <i>Anopheles</i>, but no other type of prey, juveniles of 
            <i>E. culicivora</i> perform an innate prey-specific predatory behavior involving a detour to approach
            the prey from behind 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson3">[33]</span>. This detouring approach to the prey was evident in 57% of the trials involving a
            stimulus representing an 
            <i>Anopheles</i> (stimuli 1–4; N = 31; stimulus 1 (detours/attacks): 7/11; stimulus 2: 4/9; stimulus
            3: 6/10; stimulus 4: 1/1) with juveniles, but only once with the fly stimulus (stimulus
            5; N = 8) and never with the circle stimulus (stimulus 6; N = 3). Despite these small
            sample sizes, it is apparent that they recognize the stick-figure stimuli specifically
            as 
            <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The low level categorization of the abstract stimuli into prey and non-prey items
            is also seen in other invertebrates such as the praying mantis, where basic features
            of the stimuli, including size and speed, are the main cues 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Prete1">[14]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Prete2">[34]</span>. However, 
            <i>E. culicivora</i>’s discriminations use much finer details of an image, such of the size and shape
            of mosquito antennae, when making decisions regarding preference 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1">[20]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2">[22]</span>, and thus require a considerably higher level of feature detection. The most notable
            instance of such discrimination in this study was the ability of the spiders to discriminate
            between the two disarranged stimuli in the single-choice predatory behavior experiment,
            where the only difference between the stimuli were the relative angles between the
            elements and yet one was categorized as prey, while the other was not. Nelson and
            Jackson 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1">[20]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2">[22]</span> have shown that the resting posture of a mosquito is an important cue for recognition.
            Our findings fine-tune those conclusions by suggesting that it is not the angle of
            the body compared to a surface or horizon, but rather the relative angles between
            the body elements that is crucial for recognition.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Discrimination of orientation has been shown in honeybees (
            <i>Apis mellifera</i>), which can distinguish different orientations even when these are produced through
            illusory contours 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-VanHateren1">[35]</span> and without clear edge detection 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Horridge1">[36]</span>. Horridge 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Horridge2">[37]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Horridge3">[38]</span> proposed that the generalization ability of the honeybee uses different parameters
            of an image to form local cues. These discrimination mechanisms were based on physical
            aspects of an image, but Avargues-Weber et al. 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-AvarguesWeber1">[39]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-AvarguesWeber2">[40]</span> demonstrated that honeybees are even capable of abstract concepts such as above-below
            and left-right. Unlike in the bee studies, we used unlearned stimuli and untrained
            animals, and show that 
            <i>E. culicivora</i> is capable of discrimination using a significantly more complex abstract concept
            - angles between disconnected elements.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">One way of achieving such discrimination ability is by storing the ‘correct’ orientation
            of the various elements and comparing each element to stored memory. However, the
            spiders occasionally pounced upon the stimulus while standing on the sides or the
            ceiling of the starting chamber (analogous to behavior common in a natural setting,
            XJN pers. obs.), suggesting that orientation effects do not play a role in these decisions.
            While it is tempting to consider this type of object consistency in recognition to
            be superior to that seen in human recognition of faces (where face recognition is
            degraded significantly more than other objects when viewed upside-down 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Yin1">[41]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Piepers1">[44]</span>), there is an inherent difference between the two - faces often have a prototypical
            orientation, while in the spider’s natural three-dimensional environment prey is often
            viewed from different orientations.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">An alternative mechanism of achieving the discrimination ability seen in this study
            is by ‘calculating’ the relative difference of the angles and comparing that to stored
            angles that represent prey. While discrimination of orientation has been well studied
            in vertebrates and invertebrates 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Appelle1">[45]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Srinivasan1">[49]</span>, relative angle discrimination in non-human animals remains largely unstudied. In
            humans, however, this ability has been well studied (e.g., 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Marr1">[50]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Kennedy1">[52]</span>) and there is some evidence for a neural mechanism that encodes angles in humans
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Regan1">[53]</span>, as well as in macaques 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Ito1">[54]</span> and cats 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Shevelev1">[55]</span>.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Our results demonstrate that 
            <i>E. culicivora</i> not only categorizes the simplified abstract stimuli as prey, but recognizes them
            as its preferred prey, exhibiting higher level categorization or within-category discrimination.
            This was the case even for the disarranged version of the blood-fed 
            <i>Anopheles</i>, a capability not dissimilar to that of humans with visual expertise when viewing
            fragmented images of cars or faces 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Harel1">[56]</span>, although in our case the images were abstract and dispersed rather than fragmented.
            
            <i>E. culicivora</i> not showing any preference between the blood-fed 
            <i>Anopheles</i> stimulus and its disarranged version was perhaps the most surprising finding of this
            study. While it is possible that 
            <i>E. culicivora’s</i> response to the image of the disarranged 
            <i>Anopheles</i> was due to its resemblance to some other unknown prey rather than 
            <i>Anopheles</i>, this is unlikely as the dietary preferences of these spiders has been well studied
            
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Jackson1">[19]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1">[20]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2">[22]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson3">[33]</span>. We should note that experiments using stimuli 4 and 7 were both run at a later date.
            While this too might have affected the results, this also seems unlikely, as the laboratory
            conditions were constant and the spiders were healthy. Another alternative explanation
            is that the specific arrangement of the elements of the disarranged 
            <i>Anopheles</i> exploits a sensory bias in the 
            <i>E. culicivora’s</i> visual pathways, while the altered version of this stimulus does not. Regrettably,
            we could not test the spider’s responses to other alternative arrangements of these
            stimuli. Nonetheless, either through a sensory bias in the visual pathways, or by
            higher level visual analysis, the spiders evidently categorized both the blood-fed
            
            <i>Anopheles</i> stimulus and its disarranged version as their preferred prey. This suggests that
            they do not use a global, or holistic approach to recognition 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Rock1">[4]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Piepers1">[44]</span>, but rely instead on the analysis of specific elements at a local level to recognize
            an object 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Frster1">[6]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Heinze1">[8]</span>. This type of analysis functions much like distributed feature extraction algorithms
            of object recognition in computer vision based upon the vertebrate visual cortex 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Won1">[57]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Lillywhite1">[58]</span>, in which low-level areas of the nervous system are delegated to recognizing different
            elements which are then fed to higher order centers 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Sanes1">[59]</span>. A closer look at how these spiders visually analyze what it is they are seeing will
            provide a deeper understanding of what specific features these spiders are looking
            for when they are looking for prey.

            <h3>a. General</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">All spiders used in this study were at least second generation laboratory reared individuals,
               and no juveniles tested had ever encountered mosquitos. Testing was carried between
               0730 and 1200 h in a ÿharacteriz-controlled laboratory set to 24° with a photoperiod
               of 12L∶12D, lights on at 07∶00. Test spiders were unmated adults (body length, 4.5–5.5
               mm) and juveniles (1.5–2.5 mm). Standard rearing and maintenance was as in earlier
               studies (for details, see 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Jackson1">[19]</span>, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson1">[20]</span>). Spiders were caged individually and were fed to satiation once a week on 
               <i>Drosophila</i> spp. Two h prior to their use as prey, 
               <i>Drosophila</i> were given a honey and human blood (obtained from a blood bank) meal by inserting
               a cotton dental wick dipped in the mixture into their rearing container. Test spider
               hunger levels were standardized by a 5–7 day pretrial fast. Test spider predatory
               behaviors (noticing, stalking and/or pouncing) and their timing were recorded during
               all experiments. Noticing ÿharacte is ÿharacterized by the spider performing an optomotor
               response to face the stimulus with its AM eyes and subsequently staring continuously
               at the stimulus for a few seconds. Stalking behavior is ÿharacterized by the salticid
               slowly stepping toward the prey while visually fixated on the prey. Both are reliably
               identifiable behaviors.

               of a blood-fed female 
               <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> mosquito in typical resting posture, while the simplified images 2 (not blood-fed)
               and 3 (blood-fed) were similar but used only straight lines and ovals, with the latter
               depicting a blood-fed mosquito with an engorged abdomen, known as an important prey-identification

               angles of any of the elements of image 3, while ensuring the elements were disconnected
               and, to humans, no longer resembling a mosquito. Image 5 was created by rendering
               a photograph of a housefly (
               <i>Musca domestica</i>) to grayscale and removing the background. Image 6, a circle the size of a housefly
               was created as a control, as were images 7 and 8. Image 7 was an altered version of
               image 4 where the angles of each of the elements of the image were altered and image
               8 was a disarranged version of image 6, broken into 4 unequal sections. All images
               were created on a background of 250, 250, 250 RGB and had black pixel counts between
               ca. 200 and 550 pixels (
               <span ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097819-t003">Table 3</span>). Screen size was set to 1024×768 pixels. All images were sized similarly and were
               presented at biologically relevant sizes (to the nearest 0.5 mm).

               a computer, and placed 100 mm from the screen. The videos were played on a continuous
               loop using VLC player software. The screen was made of two protective sheets of glass
               (each 2 mm thick, 5 cm wide×5 cm long) with LCD screen polarizers from a Toshiba Tecra
               A9 PTS52C-MH409C laptop cut to size between them. This setup was used as we have found
               that the screen polarizers effectively reduce the brightness of the projected videos
               and did not result in a polarized image, while the glass sheets prevented the screen
               polarizers from getting damaged while being handled and cleaned. Due to the high spatial
               resolution of salticid principal eyes (ca. 11 minutes of arc, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Land2">[25]</span>) images projected directly onto a screen will appear pixelated once the spider gets
               close. To overcome this, while maintaining life size images at high resolution, larger
               than life size stimuli were back-projected through a lens placed between the projector
               and a screen, which reduced the projected image by ca. a factor of 10. Fine tuning
               the size of the projected stimuli was achieved by varying the size of the VLC player
               window on the computer monitor.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">To answer this question, we tested the predatory responses of the spiders to individual
               stimuli (single-choice predatory behavior experiment). An angled wooden ramp supported
               by a wooden pole glued to a wooden base was placed in front of the screen and projector
               (see 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097819-g002">Figure 2a</span> for dimensions). The apparatus was painted with two coats of polyurethane, but the
               top face of the ramp had a sticker marked with a 5 mm grid to allow accurate measurement
               of the spider’s distance from the stimulus when a particular behavior was observed.
               The ramp was wiped with 80% ethanol and allowed to dry for 15 min between each test
               to eliminate possible chemotactile traces from spiders in previous tests.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">For each test, a spider was placed on the ramp and covered with a petri dish, at a
               distance of 6 (juveniles) or 10 (adults) cm from the center of the petri dish to the
               screen. These distances were used as they are far enough from the screen so that the
               spiders couldn’t ‘wald’ directly onto the stimuli, while being close enough to enhance
               the chances of the spiders reacting to the stimuli (juveniles were less responsive
               to stimuli at a distance compared to adults). The screen was covered with a piece
               of black cardboard until test spiders were released to prevent them seeing the stimulus
               until tests began. Once the spiders were relaxed (staying stationary or grooming)
               the screen was uncovered, the petri dish was removed and timing started. Tests ended
               when the spiders pounced on an image or walked/jumped off the ramp. If a spider noticed
               the image, the session was considered successful and tests were not repeated with
               the same spider. A spider that failed to notice the stimulus was tested up to twice
               in one day, or up to a total of 4 times in the following 3 days.

            <h3>d. Do Jumping Spiders View Abstract Images as their Preferred Prey?</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In this experiment we relied on 
               <i>E. culicivora’</i>s proven preference for 
               <i>Anopheles</i> mosquitoes and presented them with a two-choice test. All spiders used in this test
               were laboratory reared and had no prior experience with mosquitoes. For these tests,
               rendered movies contained two images (
               <span ref-type="table" rid="pone-0097819-t001">Table 1</span>) which moved identically and simultaneously. In each test, which image was on the
               right and which was on the left was randomized. The movies were projected as above,
               but experiments were held within a specialized apparatus containing a stainless steel
               ramp (15 mm wide×150 mm long; angled up by 25
               <b>°</b>) in front of the screen. The ramp was inside a glass chamber (diameter 300 mm, length
               525 mm long) with removable sealing steel end plates (diameter 200 mm, kept off during
               this set of experiments). Welded to the ramp was a bracket onto which the screen was
               attached with a gap of 5 mm from the ramp. The ramp/screen unit (‘ramp complex’) sat
               mounted within holes on a stainless steel platform spanning the length of the cylinder
               (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097819-g002">Figure 2b</span>). In this way it could be removed for cleaning with 80% ethanol after each test and
               returned to the same place, while ensuring that the distance between the screen and
               the reducing lens and projector was always the same (and thus stimulus size was constant).
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">At a distance of 22 mm from the end of the ramp, a stainless steel ‘starting box’
               (11 mm wide×19 mm high×22 mm deep; i.e., furthest point 44 mm from top end of ramp)
               was welded to the ramp complex (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0097819-g002">Figure 2b</span>). The box had a transparent Plexiglas cover wired to an external controller so that
               it could be opened remotely. The spider was placed into the starting box and the door
               was closed. After 2 min, the ramp complex was put in place. Once the spider was away
               from the door of the starting box, after ca. 20 s, the door was opened and tests began.
               Tests ended with the spider pouncing on one of the two images on the screen or to
               jumping/walking off the ramp. Failing these two conditions, tests were stopped after
               15 min. In this experiment we were interested in pouncing ÿehavior rather than instalking
               ÿehavior, as the former constitutes a more distinct choice by the spiders. For this
               reason, both adult and juvenile spiders were released a short distance from the screen
               (see 
               <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0097819.s013">Video S2</span> for a sample of the spider behavior in this experiment).

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">All analyses were done using SPSS Statistics v.20. For the single-choice predatory
               behavior experiment, GLM analyses were performed to check for the main effects of
               stimulus type, ‘sex’, relative contrast (number of black pixels against a white background)
               which was either in the ca. 200 or ca. 500 pixels) and their interaction on the spider’s
               choice to stalk the stimuli. Interactions between stimulus relative contrast and stimulus
               type were not analyzed, as these are nested. Sexes were divided into three – female,
               male and juvenile as their sex cannot be discerned and their behavior differs 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson2">[22]</span>, 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0097819-Nelson3">[33]</span>. In this model the dispersion parameter was set at 1, and type III sums of squares
               were used, though there was no qualitative difference from type I. Kruskal-Wallis
               tests were used to compare the predatory responses between the different sexes, with
               Mann-Whitney U tests for pairwise analysis. Cochran’s Q tests were used to test how
               the different stimuli affected the chances of the spiders noticing the stimulus and
               the propensity to stalk and pounce. Friedman tests were used to test the effects of
               the different stimuli on stalking initiation distance, as well as their effects on
               the amount of time it took the spiders to start stalking. When these effects were
               found to be significant, McNemar tests were used for pairwise comparisons. For the
               two-choice predatory behavior experiments, Binomial tests were used to test the spider’s
               choices, as well as possible side-bias.
