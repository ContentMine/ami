            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We used four landscape variables (topographic wetness index [TWI], soil type, land
               use-land cover, and distance to stream) and accumulated precipitation to model larval
               habitat locations in a region of western Kenya through two methods: logistic regression
               and random forest. Additionally, we used two separate data sets to account for variation
               in habitat locations across space and over time.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Larval habitats were more likely to be present in locations with a lower slope to
               contributing area ratio (i.e. TWI), closer to streams, with agricultural land use
               relative to nonagricultural land use, and in friable clay/sandy clay loam soil and
               firm, silty clay/clay soil relative to friable clay soil. The probability of larval
               habitat presence increased with increasing accumulated precipitation. The random forest
               models were more accurate than the logistic regression models, especially when accumulated
               precipitation was included to account for seasonal differences in precipitation. The
               most accurate models for the two data sets had area under the curve (AUC) values of
               0.864 and 0.871, respectively. TWI, distance to the nearest stream, and precipitation
               had the greatest mean decrease in Gini impurity criteria in these models.

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">This study demonstrates the usefulness of random forest models for larval malaria
               vector habitat modeling. TWI and distance to the nearest stream were the two most
               important landscape variables in these models. Including accumulated precipitation
               in our models improved the accuracy of larval habitat location predictions by accounting
               for seasonal variation in the precipitation. Finally, the sampling strategy employed
               here for model parameterization could serve as a framework for creating predictive
               larval habitat models to assist in larval control efforts.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Malaria is one of the most significant infectious diseases affecting people in poverty,
            with an estimated 219 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2010 killing 660,000 people
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</span>]. An estimated 1.44 billion people in South America, Africa, and Asia lived in areas
            with stable transmission of malaria caused by 
            <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Welch), yet the risk of 
            <i>P. falciparum</i> transmission varies considerably across its range [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</span>]. Even at fine scales, the spatial distribution of malaria is heterogeneous, differing
            among households within a community [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</span>-
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</span>]. Of course, socioeconomic and immunological differences contribute to the spatial
            heterogeneity of malaria [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</span>]. Additionally, landscape factors contribute to the spatial distribution of malaria
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</span>], which is likely an indirect relationship ultimately due, in part, to the influence
            of landscape factors on the locations of the aquatic habitats of the vector mosquito
            larvae. The spatial distribution of the larval habitats partially determines the spatial
            distribution of the adult malaria vectors in many landscapes [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</span>-
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</span>]. Subsequently, the heterogeneous spatial distribution of malaria vectors among households
            coincides with the spatial distribution of malaria parasitemia in some landscapes
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</span>]. Therefore, understanding the factors that determine the distribution of the larval
            habitats facilitates our understanding of the spatial determinants of malaria transmission.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The vast majority of deaths from malaria (91%) occur in Africa [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</span>], where the primary vector mosquitoes are among the most efficient vectors of malaria
            in the world. Two of the most widely distributed vectors in Africa are 
            <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> s.s. Giles and 
            <i>Anopheles arabiensis</i> Patton, which are both members of a species complex of eight closely related, morphologically
            indistinguishable species known collectively as 
            <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> s.l. [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</span>]. In many regions the larval habitats of 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.s. and 
            <i>An. arabiensis</i> are similar, and in fact, the two species are often found within the same larval
            habitats [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</span>-
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</span>]. These larval habitats are generally smaller, temporary bodies of standing water
            persisting for about 20 to 40 days [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</span>], with rain being the main source of the water.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The locations of larval 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats are associated with certain environmental features of landscapes. Previous
            studies have found more larval habitats closer to streams [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</span>] and in locations with agricultural land uses [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</span>]. Others have used a topographic wetness index (TWI) [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</span>] to predict the locations of larval habitats, finding more larval habitats in locations
            having a combination of greater upslope area contributing to drainage and less slope
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</span>-
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</span>]. The influence of soil types on the presence of larval habitats has largely been
            ignored, although Bøgh and colleagues [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</span>] found larval habitats exclusively in alluvial soils in The Gambia. Finally, seasonal
            differences in rainfall likely influence the number of larval habitats on the landscape
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</span>,

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The objectives of this study were to create a model for predicting larval 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitat locations using landscape variables that predict the likelihood of standing
            water bodies, and to account for seasonal changes in habitat probability based on
            accumulated precipitation. A model for accurately predicting the locations of malaria
            vector larval habitats has multiple utilities. First, it allowed us to investigate
            the links between larval habitat distribution and adult malaria vector distribution
            across a large landscape where manually mapping the larval habitats is infeasible
            (McCann et al. 
            <i>in preparation</i>). Additionally, such a model could be useful for malaria control programs, allowing
            program managers to focus their efforts to areas where larval habitats are most likely
            to occur.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The Asembo region of Rarieda District in western Kenya (Figure 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</span>A) is a rural community of about 60,000 people covering about 200 km
               <sup>2</sup>. Most of the residents are subsistence farmers, and the landscape is largely dominated
               by small-scale agriculture. Small plots of land generally surround family-based groups
               of houses, or compounds, further arranged into villages. While the compounds are highly
               dispersed within villages, the boundaries between villages are often discernable only
               by residents [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</span>] (Figure 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</span>B). Asembo sits in the lowlands along the shores of Lake Victoria, with elevations
               ranging from 1,100 m to 1,400 m above sea level and low topographic relief. Networks
               of streams run across the region and drain into Lake Victoria. Farmland is common
               in these low-lying drainage basins, as well as throughout the region. Houses are mostly
               absent within 100 m of the streams. Rainfall is seasonally bimodal but may occur year
               round, with monthly precipitation totals ranging from 7 to 490 mm and yearly totals
               ranging from 1,100 to 1,800 mm from 2003 through 2012.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Malaria is holoendemic in Asembo, with parasitemia rates in children under 5 being
               around 50% in 2009 [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</span>]. Similar to rainfall patterns, malaria transmission occurs year round, with seasonal
               peaks in May-July and October-November. The predominant species of malaria is 
               <i>P. falciparum</i>. Two of the primary malaria vectors in the region are 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.s. and 
               <i>An. arabiensis</i>, the only two members of the 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. species complex found here. The other primary malaria vector in the region is
               
               <i>Anopheles funestus</i> Giles. However, 
               <i>An. funestus</i> and 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. larvae do not generally occupy the same habitats, as the larval habitats of
               
               <i>An. funestus</i> are generally larger and more permanent than those of 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</span>]. Larval 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats are numerous and widespread in Asembo yet heterogeneously distributed
               [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</span>]. This makes it difficult to establish a relationship between larval habitats and
               the spatial distribution of the adult vectors or malaria prevalence in people. A 10
               by 10 km study site was defined within Asembo to examine variation in the determinants
               of larval habitat location across a relatively large area. Because we wanted to include
               the lakeshore in the study site, the southern border fell largely within the lake,
               leaving 96.43 km
               <sup>2</sup> of actual landmass in the 10 by 10 km site.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The 10 by 10 km study site was divided into 500 by 500 m quadrats for larval 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitat ground surveys. After excluding the quadrats that fell completely in
               the lake, we selected quadrats for larval habitat ground surveys using spatially stratified
               random sampling from the remaining 393 quadrats (Figure 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</span>C). For spatial stratification the 10 by 10 km area was divided into 2 by 2 km blocks.
               The 500 by 500 m quadrats were randomly selected from groups defined by the 2 by 2 km
               blocks. Spatial stratification was implemented to avoid the problem of sampling a
               cluster of quadrats in a certain area of the grid, assuring spatial variation in the
               predictor variables [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</span>]. The time required for surveying a quadrat varied greatly according to the number
               of larval habitats in the quadrat, which was not known 
               <i>a priori</i>. Therefore, we surveyed as many quadrats as possible during the targeted time frame,
               which was the end of the long rainy season to coincide with the peak 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. population level [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</span>-
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</span>]. Thus, 31 quadrats were surveyed exhaustively over 22 days between 17 May 2011 and
               4 July 2011.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">All potential larval 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats found in the quadrats were georeferenced with GPS units. Six field
               workers spaced 20 m from each other walked from one end of a quadrat to the other,
               using ArcPad (ESRI, Redlands, CA) on a GPS unit for navigating the borders of the
               quadrat. This was repeated until the entire quadrat was covered, usually in four to
               five passes. This approach allowed us to say, with certainty, where habitats were
               absent during the survey. In addition to recording the locations of each larval habitat,
               we recorded the presence or absence of 
               <i>Anopheles</i> larvae. Larval 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats were defined as any standing body of water, regardless of whether 
               <i>Anopheles</i> were present on the day of the ground survey, and falling under the following categories:
               drainage channel, burrow pit, rain pool, runoff, cluster of hoof prints, stream bed
               pool, pond/reservoir, wet meadow, well and tire track [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</span>]. For a subset of habitats (the first five 
               <i>Anopheles-</i>positive habitats for each of the four to five passes across each quadrat), 
               <i>Anopheles</i> larvae and pupae were collected to confirm that the habitats were being used by 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. All visible 
               <i>Anopheles</i> larvae, up to a maximum of 20, were collected using a 300 ml dipper or plastic pipette
               as appropriate according to the size of the habitat. The specimens were transported
               to the lab for species identification. Larvae were raised to fourth-stage instars
               for identification, while pupae were allowed to eclose as adults before identification.
               All identifications were done according to Gillies and Coetzee [

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Spatial data for soils, land use-land cover (LULC), distance to the nearest stream,
               and TWI were created across the study site. These data were assembled in ArcGIS 10.0
               (ESRI, Redlands, CA) in raster data structures with a spatial resolution of 20 m.
               All four datasets were treated as constant over time. Soil data were taken from the
               1:1,000,000 exploratory soil map of Kenya, compiled by the Kenya Soil Survey in 1980
               [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</span>]. The three soil types in Asembo were 1) friable clay, 2) friable clay/sandy clay
               loam, and 3) firm, silty clay/clay. Of these soil types, friable clay drains more
               quickly, and firm, silty clay/clay drains more slowly. A satellite image from the
               IKONOS-2 sensor was used to create the LULC classification. Briefly, unsupervised
               classification was done using the K-means method [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</span>] in ENVI 4.8 (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO). Classes were combined
               into a binary data layer of agricultural or non-agricultural land use. All streams
               in Asembo were mapped using GPS units, and the Euclidean distance in meters to the
               nearest stream was calculated.

               landscape, logistic regression and 
               <i>random forest</i>[
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</span>]. Logistic regression is commonly used in species distribution modeling [

               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</span>]. Ecologists have recently started using the random forest method as well, because
               it does not require any assumptions about the distribution of the data [

               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</span>]. Random forest is a machine learning classification method that extends classification
               and regression tree (CART) approaches, which work by recursive binary partitioning
               of the data space into increasingly homogenous regions [

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Both methods were used separately on the two datasets (one from the 10 by 10 km area
               and the other from the 15 monthly ground surveys in Aduoyo-Miyare and Nguka). For
               both methods, the unit of analysis was a 20 m pixel. Because each of the 31 quadrats
               in the 10 by 10 km area was surveyed once, each pixel in that dataset had a single
               value for all of the variables described above (habitat presence/absence, TWI, soil,
               LULC, distance to stream, and 31 values of 
               <i>n</i>-day precipitation). The value of 
               <i>n</i>-day precipitation was based on the day a given quadrat was surveyed (Figure 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</span>). In the Aduoyo-Miyare and Nguka dataset, each pixel was repeated 15 times. The value
               of 
               <i>n</i>-day precipitation was based on the final day of ground surveys, which took only 1
               to 3 days, each month (Figure 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</span>). Habitat presence/absence was determined by the ground survey data for each month,
               while TWI, soil, LULC and distance to stream were constant for a given pixel across
               all 15 months.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">We built a series of candidate logistic regression models to select the most useful
               predictor variables. To determine which 
               <i>n</i>-day precipitation measure to use, each cumulative precipitation measure was used
               alone as the predictor variable in separate regression models. Of these, the model
               with the lowest BIC determined the cumulative precipitation measure used in the subsequent
               logistic regression candidate models. The five predictor variables (TWI, soil, LULC,
               distance to stream, and precipitation) were then used in all 31 possible combinations
               to build candidate logistic regression models for each of the two datasets. To restrict
               the candidate model sets to relatively simple models with easily interpretable parameters,
               interactions among the five predictor variables were not included. The top models
               were again selected according to the lowest BIC. While the locations of larval 
               <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats are generally clustered, we did not account for spatial autocorrelation
               in the logistic regression models presented here. Previous studies modeling larval
               habitats have found similar results for logistic regression models with and without
               parameters accounting for spatial autocorrelation [

               determined by the mean decrease in the Gini impurity criterion when removing the variable
               from the full model (TWI, soil, LULC, distance to stream, and precipitation). The
               cumulative precipitation measure with the highest mean decrease in the Gini impurity
               criterion was used in the final random forest models. Gini impurity criteria were
               also used to measure variable importance in the random forest models. A greater mean

               their accuracy at predicting larval habitat presence and absence for holdout data.
               Fifty percent of each dataset was randomly selected as a holdout dataset before model
               building. Evaluation of model accuracy required the selection of a threshold at which
               to convert predicted probabilities into larval habitat presence or absence. Because
               threshold specific accuracy statistics can be sensitive to the threshold used for
               conversion, we generated an optimal threshold value by minimizing the absolute value
               of the difference between sensitivity and specificity [
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</span>]. This approach was chosen because both sensitivity and specificity were equally
               important for the intended application of the predictive models. To assess the performance
               of each model, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, percent correctly classified
               (PCC), and kappa of each approach at each of the thresholds from the methods above.
               We also calculated the threshold-independent area under the curve (AUC) statistic

               measures to assess differences among the temporal-resolution/modeling-approach combinations.
               To quantify the contribution of cumulative 30-day precipitation to variation in the
               number of habitats found each month in Aduoyo-Miyare and Nguka, we used simple linear
               regression.

            the locations of 1,673 larval 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats. Six of the quadrats did not have any larval habitats, while the mean
            number of habitats per 500 by 500 m quadrat was 54. 
            <i>Anopheles</i> larvae were present in 921 of the 1,673 habitats on the day each habitat was recorded.
            As detailed in the methods, 
            <i>Anopheles</i> larvae and pupae were collected from 141 of the habitats, 77% of which were occupied
            by 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. on the day of collection. Most of the larvae and pupae (79%) were identified

            four of the variables (TWI, distance to stream, soil type, and cumulative 6-day precipitation).
            No other model had a ΔBIC less than 9 (Table

            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitat locations in the 10 by 10 km area was the random forest method with
            all five variables (AUC = 0.864). In this model, TWI had the greatest mean decrease
            in the Gini impurity criterion, followed by distance to stream, precipitation, soil
            and LULC (Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</span>). Removing the cumulative 14-day precipitation from this model reduced the accuracy
            of the model (Table 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</span>). The best logistic regression model for the 10 by 10 km area was less accurate than
            the random forest model when evaluated against the holdout data (Table 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</span>). When the probabilities of larval habitat location across the entire 10 by 10 km
            study site were estimated using the most accurate models from each method, the random
            forest model clearly produced a more heterogeneous landscape at a fine scale than
            that produced by the logistic regression method (Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</span>).

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The use of models to predict the distribution of species is common in ecology [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</span>], and novel approaches to building these models such as random forest have become
            more widely available in recent years. We used two methods to predict the probability
            of larval 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitat across the landscape and over time, and the random forest method produced
            more accurate models than the logistic regression method. This may be due to the differences
            in predicted heterogeneity of larval habitats at fine scales between the two methods,
            which can be compared across the entire 10 by 10 km study site (Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</span>). Predictions from the random forest model are more fragmented, showing a closer
            proximity of high-probability locations to low-probability locations, relative to
            the estimates from the logistic regression model. The general pattern is similar for
            the predictions of both models at broad scales (Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</span>). However, the fine scale heterogeneity in the random forest estimates more closely
            reflects the nature of actual larval habitat distribution on the ground, where larval
            
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats are distributed as many small patches rather than one continuous, large
            patch.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The most important landscape variables for predicting larval habitat presence in these
            models were TWI and distance to the nearest stream. In the 10 by 10 km random forest
            model, the mean decreases in the Gini impurity criteria of TWI and distance to the
            nearest stream were much larger than those of LULC and soil (Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</span>), indicating a stronger association with the prediction of habitat presence [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</span>]. In general practice, high quality soil and LULC data can be difficult to acquire.
            Given limited resources, our data suggest it is possible to build reasonably accurate
            larval habitat models without these two landscape variables. Nonetheless, soil and
            LULC do show an association with habitat presence according to the logistic regression
            models presented here.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">An important question in the application of predictive larval habitat models is whether
            models parameterized with data for habitat locations in one season are applicable
            to another season [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</span>]. The creation of larval 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats (which are temporary, small bodies of standing water) depends on rainfall,
            which varies seasonally across the range of the species complex. One strategy to model
            differences between seasons is to account for variation in precipitation. In the random
            forest models, accumulated precipitation was less important than TWI and distance
            to the nearest stream, but it was a more important predictor variable than soil and
            LULC (Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</span>). Additionally, we found more larval habitats in months with more precipitation compared
            to the same area in months with less precipitation (Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</span>). Thus, including accumulated precipitation in our models improved the accuracy of
            larval habitat location predictions. These results should be interpreted with caution
            given the use of a single location about 40 km from the study site as the source of
            precipitation data. Daily precipitation totals can be spatially heterogeneous at that
            scale. Despite this limitation, it is clear from previous work that variation in precipitation
            influences larval 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</span>]. However, the relationship may be more complex than it first appears. For example,
            it may not be linear. Rather, the number of larval habitats may increase monotonically
            with accumulated precipitation up to a threshold, after which more of the water on
            the landscape flows as surface sheet or channeled water, which is unsuitable aquatic
            habitat for 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. larvae. Additionally, different habitat types may respond differently to increasing
            accumulated precipitation. Standing water forming in drainage channels and stream
            bed pools may be described better by a threshold relationship than the water filling
            burrow pits, hoof prints and tire tracks, because the former develops from channel
            and sheet water made stationary by diminished water flows, whereas the latter forms
            from water accumulating into various catchments not associated with channels. These
            additional factors may explain some of the uneven residual error seen in Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</span>, where the 4 months in the red box falling above the fitted regression line have
            more larval habitats with a lower accumulated precipitation relative to the 3 months
            in the blue box falling below the fitted regression line.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The 
            <i>n</i>-day cumulative precipitation measure used for each modeling approach within each
            dataset was selected according to the criteria outlined in the methods to maximize
            the predictive power of each model. However, comparing across modeling approaches
            within each dataset, the cumulative precipitation measures were highly correlated
            (Table 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</span>). Thus, the choice between 21-day cumulative precipitation and 30-day cumulative
            precipitation, for example, may be less important in general practice than using either
            measure instead of the daily precipitation total (referred to as 0-day in Table 
            <span ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</span>). Comparing across datasets, which differed in temporal scale, the 6-day cumulative
            precipitation and the 30-day cumulative precipitation are only moderately correlated.
            Their differences in terms of model fit (BIC) could reflect temporal differences in
            hydrology on this landscape, but it may also reflect a limitation of the 10 by 10 km
            data collection (see below).A counterintuitive result of this study was that the odds
            of larval habitat presence decreased with increasing cumulative 6-day precipitation
            using the best logistic regression model of the 10 by 10 km data. Most likely this
            reflects a limitation of the 10 by 10 km data collection rather than the true influence
            of precipitation on larval habitat presence, given the range of cumulative 6-day precipitation
            over the 49-day period (1.5 mm – 51.1 mm; Figure 
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</span>). The sampling strategy for those data was designed to capture variation in landscape
            variables over space. While precipitation varied among the days of the ground surveys,
            we were not able to capture that variation over the full range of values for the landscape
            variables. Instead, the effect of accumulated precipitation in this particular model
            may be an indication of some other property differing between the quadrats sampled
            on days of higher and lower accumulated precipitation. Alternatively, the temporal
            scale over which larval habitats respond to variation in accumulated precipitation
            may be closer to monthly than daily. That is, ground surveys conducted at monthly
            intervals in the same area may be more likely to be different than daily samples within
            a month in the same area. As noted above, this may also reflect the use of a single
            location as the source of all precipitation data.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">In addition to the use of precipitation data from one location, there were other limitations
            to this study. First, we did not account for spatial autocorrelation in the logistic
            regression models. Doing so may have slightly increased the confidence intervals associated
            with the parameters of those models, but it is unlikely to have changed the model
            comparisons or accuracy evaluations presented here. Previous studies modeling 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. larval habitat locations have found similar results for logistic regression
            models with and without parameters accounting for spatial autocorrelation [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</span>-
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</span>]. Second, there were additional variables we could have included in our analysis,
            such as a model-based wetness index (MWI) or normalized difference vegetation index
            (NDVI). MWI are similar to TWI, but MWI use simulations of distributed catchment models
            to account for differences between groundwater gradients and surface gradients, thereby
            creating more accurate topographic data [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</span>]. We used TWI here because it has performed well in other models of 
            <i>Anopheles</i> larval habitats [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</span>-
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</span>], and is easily implemented compared with MWI. While our models using TWI showed
            high accuracy, further studies comparing the use of MWI and TWI in larval habitat
            modeling are needed. NDVI has also been associated with the distribution of malaria
            [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</span>], although some studies have found contradicting results [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</span>]. NDVI is an indirect measure of available moisture, but NDVI values are additionally
            influenced by vegetation type and phenology. Thus, we used accumulated precipitation
            as a measure of available moisture.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Finally, the models developed here exclusively used physical and environmental factors
            as predictor variables, but the formation of larval 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. habitats also depends on human behavior. For example, landowners in Asembo create
            small drainage channels around fields. Standing water left behind in the channels
            creates habitats for 
            <i>An. gambiae</i> s.l. larvae [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</span>]. The locations of these drainage channels are often in low-lying agricultural areas,
            and therefore our models were able to predict the locations of most of the drainage
            channels. However, drainage channels are not found in 100% of low-lying agricultural
            areas, probably in part because of individual variation in landowner decision-making.
            Larval habitats formed from burrow pits and aggregations of hoof prints are also subject
            to variation in human behavior. While our models were able to correctly predict the
            locations of most of these habitats, interactions between the physical landscape and
            human behavior likely account for some of the locations identified incorrectly by
            the models.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The sampling designs of these two datasets allowed us to address two complementary
            goals. The monthly surveys in Aduoyo-Miyare and Nguka captured variation in precipitation
            across both dry and rainy seasons in the same landscape. This provided a stronger
            logical basis for inferences about the relationship between seasonal variation in
            precipitation and variation in the location and number of larval habitats. The small
            spatial extent of Aduoyo-Miyare and Nguka made monthly surveys more feasible, but
            it also limited the applicability of the model results across a larger area. Conversely,
            limiting the ground surveys of the 31 quadrats from the 10 by 10 km study site to
            one season likely impeded our ability to infer much about the effect of precipitation
            on these data. On the other hand, concentrating our sampling effort to increase replication
            across space in the 31 quadrats captured more variation in landscape variables, allowing
            us to apply the results of models based on these data to a larger area.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">As a general application, the spatially stratified sampling strategy used in the 10
            by 10 km site could serve as a framework for creating predictive larval habitat models
            for larval control. Targeted larval control is often cited as a useful application
            of predictive larval habitat models [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</span>,
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</span>], and we agree that there is potential for this application. For example, malaria
            control programs could identify areas suited to environmental management such as filling
            in burrow pits and engineering drainage channels to drain more completely. Additionally,
            allowing larvicide application crews to focus on areas with a higher probability of
            larval habitat presence would reduce the time, and therefore the cost, of larviciding.
            However, models fitted to data from a single geographic location may have limited
            generalizability [
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</span>]. Malaria control programs could overcome this limitation by using spatially stratified
            random samples, repeated across a variable landscape, to build models that are useful
            over larger areas.
