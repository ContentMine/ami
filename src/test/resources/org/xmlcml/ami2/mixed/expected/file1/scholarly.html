            <p>This research note has been updated to incorporate suggestions by the reviewers. Figures
               have been added of the oldest aged vertebra section for each species. All mention
               of Faben's theoretical maximum age have also been removed from the note. An additional
               Rhizoprionodon terraenovae recapture was encountered and those data were added to
               the research note (Shark L2881). Also background information about the number of each
               species tagged and recaptured was added.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Tag-recapture data grant researchers the opportunity to synthesize a vast array of
         information for species they are studying. Sharks, in particular, are well suited
         for tagging studies due to their migratory behavior, longevity, and relatively large
         size, which allows tagging at all life stages (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-2">Bonham 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 1949
         </span>). Valuable information gained from recapture data includes greater understanding
         of species-specific migratory patterns, stock structure, spatial and temporal distribution,
         site fidelity/residence times, and life histories (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-13">Kohler &amp; Turner, 2001</span>).
      </p>
      <p>Among life history parameters needed to best manage populations of fishes, robust
         longevity estimates are of paramount importance, particularly for iteroparous species,
         such as sharks. For example, assuming age at maturity, reproductive periodicity, and
         brood size are constant, the lifetime fecundity of a given species is directly linked
         to its lifespan. Longevity estimates for sharks are generally derived from von Bertalanffy
         Growth Function (VBGF) parameter estimates (i.e. growth constant); however, VBGF parameter
         estimates can be heavily affected by low sample sizes, incomplete sampling among size
         classes and/or difficulties associated with age estimation of large individuals (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-11">Goldman, 2004</span>; 
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Francis 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 2007
         </span>). Obtaining accurate longevity estimates can be hampered by the low probability of
         catching older individuals as they represent a small portion of the entire population,
         difficulty associated with capturing large specimens that are more capable of escaping
         gear than smaller conspecifics, and the reduction of older individuals in the population
         due to fishing pressure (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-1">Bishop 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 2006
         </span>). Additionally, age underestimation has been documented in multiple shark species
         including long-lived species such as the Porbeagle, 
         
         <i>Lamna nasus</i> (Bonnaterre, 1788) (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-9">Francis 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 2007
         </span>) and the Australian School Shark, 
         
         <i>Galeorhinus galeus</i> (L. 1758) (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-12">Kalish &amp; Johnston, 2001</span>), and species with intermediate life histories such as the Bonnethead, 
         
         <i>Sphyrna tiburo</i> (L. 1758) (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">Frazier 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 2014
         </span>). Due to the above factors, tag-recapture records, when available, are the most reliable
         source of longevity data as maximum time-at-liberty for any individual within the
         population would represent the highest directly known longevity. Based on tag-recapture
         data and direct age estimates, herein we report on the longevity of Atlantic Sharpnose
         Sharks 
         
         <i>Rhizoprionodon terraenovae</i> (Richardson, 1836) and Blacknose Sharks 
         
         <i>Carcharhinus acronotus</i> (Poey, 1860), both of which are common in the coastal waters off the southeastern
         United States.

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>Sharks were captured and tagged during survey operations conducted by the South Carolina
         Department of Natural Resources Adult Red Drum and Coastal Shark Longline Program
         (SCDNR) (see 
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-15">Ulrich 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 2007
         </span> for longline protocol). Collection, handling and tagging of specimens was authorized
         and controlled under the SCDNR scientific permit issued to employees of SCDNR.
      </p>
      <p>Upon capture, the fork length (FL) and sex of each shark was recorded. For those sharks
         deemed to be in good health, a Hallprint
         
         <sup>©</sup> nylon dart tag, labeled with unique identifying numbers, was inserted into the dorsal
         musculature at the base of the first dorsal fin prior to release. As tagged sharks
         were at liberty in the wild, recaptured specimens were reported by a number of sources,
         including recreational anglers, commercial fishermen and SCDNR. Estimated measurements
         at recapture were obtained from recreational and commercial fishermen and direct measurements
         were recorded from specimens recaptured by SCDNR. When possible, a sample of 8–10
         vertebrae were removed from the cervical region of the vertebral column from recaptured
         sharks.
      </p>
      <p>In the case of recaptured specimens from commercial fishermen, sharks were already
         deceased and vertebrae were removed. In the case of recaptured specimens from SCDNR,
         a IACUC protocol approved for graduate students who had previously worked with SCDNR
         on elasmobranch studies was followed; the vertebral column was severed by serrated
         knife in two cervical locations.
      </p>
      <p>To estimate age at recapture, vertebrae were prepared for analyses following the protocol
         of 
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-10">Frazier 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 2014
         </span>. Initial vertebral growth band counts were conducted by three unbiased readers with
         no knowledge of specimen length or time-at-liberty. If band counts differed among
         readers, sections were independently re-read until agreement was reached. Age at recapture
         was estimated under the assumptions: (1) the birthmark was formed prior or shortly
         after parturition, (2) the second band was formed 6 months later during the first
         winter, and (3) the third band was formed 1 year later. Therefore, we subtracted 1.5
         from each total band count to calculate age in years (e.g. 
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Loefer &amp; Sedberry, 2003</span>;

            <i>et al.</i>, 2004
         </span>).
      </p>
      <p>Age estimates at recapture were also determined by adding time-at-liberty to backtransformed
         ages at tagging. Species and sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth function parameters

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>The backtransformed and direct age estimates documented herein greatly increase the
         known longevity for 
         
         <i>R. terraenovae</i> and 
         
         <i>C. acronotus</i>, which could significantly affect population dynamics models that include longevity
         as a parameter. Interestingly, the maximum directly estimated ages for both species
         were associated with male sharks. A review of published shark age and growth studies
         shows that, in most studies, females have a greater or equal longevity than males
         (e.g.

            <i>et al.</i>, 2014
         </span>). Therefore, we believe that we did not sample older females and suggest that the
         longevity estimates we observed for each species be applied to males and females.
      </p>
      <p>Backtransformed age estimates from recaptures were in all cases larger than direct
         age estimates. This could be evidence that direct ages were underestimated, however
         direct age estimates only differed by an average of 1.8 years (range 1.0–2.5 years).
         Observed differences could be due to low sample size or individual variability in
         growth. The rearranged VBGF gives an estimate of average age-at-length based on parameter
         estimates. Therefore, specimens could have been younger or older than the average
         estimated age at time of tagging thus accounting for the discrepancy. Conversely,
         if the species-specific VBGF do not adequately describe the growth of 
         
         <i>R. terraenovae</i> and 
         
         <i>C. acronotus</i> then the observed differences would be expected. However, the growth models utilized
         were from studies with robust sample sizes that included all size classes (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-14">Loefer &amp; Sedberry, 2003</span>; 
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-6">Driggers 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 2004
         </span>).
      </p>
      <p>The age estimates from this study greatly increase longevity for both species; however,
         actual life spans could be even longer. The specimens recaptured from this study were
         tagged in the first few years of the SCDNR longline program (1994–1996). Given project
         species-specific recapture rates of less than 3% and reported tag shedding rates for
         nylon dart tags as high as 41% to 63% (
         
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="ref-16">Xiao 
            
            <i>et al.</i>, 1999
         </span>), the chances of recapturing a shark at liberty for 10+ years are small. The fact
         that eight were encountered and all exceeded published longevity estimates lends support
         to this assertion. The data gathered from these recaptures also highlights the importance
         of continuing long term surveys and tagging efforts. While return rates of tagged
         sharks are notoriously low, our data demonstrate that continued tagging efforts are
         essential to provide the most up to date and reliable estimates of maximum longevity.
         Ideally, to obtain the best possible longevity estimates for a given species, future
         efforts should focus on tagging neonate sharks with the hope of recapturing them as
         they approach the end of their lifespans.

      <p>This manuscript reports increased longevity for two common species of small coastal
         sharks (Atlantic Sharpnose Shark 
         
         <i>Rhizoprionodon terraenovae</i> and Blacknose Shark 
         
         <i>Carcharhinus acronotus</i>) based on tag recapture data. These findings are particularly interesting given the
         previously assumed longevity of these species, and are clearly relevant to population
         models that include longevity as a parameter for these species. This note is clearly
         written, and conclusions from this work are appropriately presented; moreover, these
         data illustrate the benefit of long-term fisheries-independent monitoring and tagging
         programs for long-lived species such as sharks.
      </p>
      <p>These data are clear, concise, and important to the continued successful management
         of these two species; as such, they are worthy of publication. The two tables presented
         are sufficient to convey the data discussed. Given the straightforward nature of these
         data and their appropriate interpretation by the Authors, I have no major comments.
         There are two typos in the first paragraph of the Discussion (detailed below) which
         should be addressed.

      <p>This research note presents data on the long-term recapture of seven individuals of
         two species of coastal sharks from the Northwest Atlantic; 
         
         <i>Rhizoprionodon terranovae</i>, and the 
         
         <i>Carcharhinus acronotus</i>. Based on their length at tagging, all individuals appeared to be either mature or
         close to maturity, but were recaptured between 7.7 and 12.8 years later. As neither
         species was reported to be particularly long-lived these results are interesting,
         and provide evidence that both species live longer than currently thought.  Age was
         also estimated and compared in four of the samples by reading sectioned vertebrae.
         These data contribute to growing evidence that longevity of sharks is often underestimated
         when based on vertebral ageing methods, and that some aspects of elasmobranch demography
         that have been inferred from these studies (e.g. survival) may be biased. I’m glad
         the authors have taken the time and effort to document these observations, as there
         are relatively few long-terms studies of this kind.
      </p>
      <p>While I think the data themselves are worthy of publication, I don’t think any of
         the subsequent analysis contributed hugely to the paper. Published growth curves are
         used to estimate the age at tagging, which is then added to the time at liberty to
         get a ‘backtransformed age at recapture’. Unfortunately, neither of these original
         growth studies presented the model variance, a detailed description of the data, or
         even any plots of the size at age data! Without this information, it is hard to get
         an idea of how variable size-at-age is for these species (and it is clearly quite
         variable), or the representativeness of the original sampling, etc.  Personally, I
         think other information could be more useful, like photographs of the two oldest vertebrae
         sections for reference.
      </p>
      <p>I recommend two revisions to the research note. Firstly, some more background information
         is required on the tagging study itself. It is not stated how many sharks were tagged
         and recaptured over the duration of the whole study, nor is it clear why these seven
         were chosen specifically (presumably they weren't the only recaptures). Secondly,
         I disagree that Fabens’ theoretical method for estimating longevity is the usual method
         of estimating longevity. I don’t see the value with making comparisons to theoretical
         longevity later on in the paper and find this confusing. For example, the ‘theoretical
         maximum longevities’ of 
         
         <i>R. terranovae </i>are stated to be 7.1 and 6.9 years for females and males respectively, but
         
         <div tagx="ext-link"> Loefer and Sedberry (2003)</div> reported actual longevities of 10 and 9 years.

      <p>I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise
         to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant
         reservations, as outlined above.

            <p>Longevity of 
               
               <i>Rhizoprionodon terraenovae</i> and 
               
               <i>Carcharhinus acronotus</i> in the western North Atlantic Ocean was examined using direct age estimates from
               vertebral sections and tag-recapture data. Time-at-liberty ranged from 7.7-14.0 years
               (mean =10.1) for 
               
               <i>R. terraenovae</i> and 10.9-12.8 years (mean =11.9) for 
               
               <i>C. acronotus</i>. Maximum estimated longevity was determined to be 19.8 years through tag-recapture
               data and 18.5 years from direct age estimates for 
               
               <i>R. terraenovae</i> and 22.8 years through tag-recapture data and 20.5 years through direct age estimates
               for 
               
               <i>C. acronotus</i>. These longevity estimates represent a large increase over previous estimates and
               may have significant effects on analyses that depend on longevity including lifetime
               fecundity, mortality rates, demographic analyses and stock assessments.

         <p>The authors appreciate the suggested revisions offered by the reviewer. We agree that
            it is unfortunate that the original age and growth studies did not present individual
            length at age data with their published growth curves. While we felt it most appropriate
            to cite the peer reviewed publications, it should be noted that these data are available
            for 
            
            <i>Carcharhinus acronotus</i> (SEDAR 21 DW-36, http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/sedar/download/S21_DW_36.pdf?id=DOCUMENT)
            as a working paper for United States SouthEast Data, Assessment and Review 
            
            <i>C. acronotus</i> stock assessment. Unfortunately, there are no publicly accessible documents showing
            variation in length-at-age for 
            
            <i>Rhizoprionodon terraenovae</i>. The authors agree with the reviewer that images of the oldest aged vertebra for
            each species are appropriate, and we have added those figures. 
         </p>
         <p>As requested, the authors have added minimal background information detailing the
            total tagged and recaptured of each species. The authors feel adding additional background
            information beyond this would not be of value to readers. 
         </p>
         <p>The recaptures that were used for this note were chosen due to their lengthy times-at-liberty.
            Recaptures with shorter times-at-liberty were not used as they would be less informative
            given variability in length-at-age. 
         </p>
         <p>The authors agree with the reviewer that including Faben's theoretical maximum longevities
            were confusing and we have removed these data from the note.
