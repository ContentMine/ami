DNA methylation patterns are subject to genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming at certain developmental stages, particularly during certain phases of germ cell and early embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. After fertilization, DNA methylation of sperm and oocyte-derived chromosomes is largely erased. While Southern blot studies of DNA methylation in repetitive elements in mouse gametes suggested that sperm chromosomes are more hypermethylated than those of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], a recent analysis using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation revealed equally low DNA methylation levels in both sperm and oocytes, at least in the promoter regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hence the observed decrease of DNA methylation during early embryonic development apparently largely reflects demethylation of (some) repetitive elements. Upon further development DNA methylation again increases in cells of the inner cell mass, while cells of the trophectoderm remain rather hypomethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The dynamics of DNA demethylation during early preimplantation development have been thoroughly investigated by a number of research groups in different mammalian species. Immunohistochemical studies on mouse zygotes using antibodies against 5-methyl-cytosine (&#x003b1;-5meC) showed a rapid loss of DNA methylation exclusively in the paternal pronucleus. The reactivity of the &#x003b1;-5meC antibody starts to diminish around the early pronuclear stage 2 (PN2) when the protamine-histone exchange is completed (approximately three hours post fertilization). At early PN4 (approximately 8 to 10 hours post fertilization) the &#x003b1;-5meC signal is completely absent from the paternal pronucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Bisulfite sequencing of zygotic DNA confirmed these rapid demethylation events for some single copy sequences and repetitive elements but revealed that imprinting control regions of imprinted genes and certain classes of repeat sequences remain refractory to such general demethylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Pronounced active demethylation of paternal DNA was not only found in mouse but also reported for rat, pig, human and, to a lesser extent, for bovine zygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is therefore considered as a general early epigenetic reprogramming event in mammalian development. However, the biological function of this process remains unclear. It has been proposed as being important for early transcriptional control, or as serving as a mechanism to reduce accumulation of transgenerational epigenetic effects propagated through the male germ line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The concept of paternal pronuclear demethylation as a general hallmark of early mammalian development was challenged by reports stating that this process is lacking in rabbit, ovine and pig zygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. On the contrary, other experiments demonstrated the capability of mature ovine oocytes to demethylate mouse sperm DNA introduced by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, Zhang et al showed a partial loss of DNA methylation at centromeric satellite repeats in rabbit zygotes following ICSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. While these data suggest the existence of DNA demethylation activity in rabbit and ovine oocytes, it remained unclear whether the paternal pronucleus is subject to such demethylation in naturally derived zygotes.</p><p>Concomitant with pronuclear DNA methylation reprogramming specific alterations in histone modifications have been observed in early mouse embryos. On the paternal chromosomes protamines are rapidly exchanged by acetylated histones which subsequently become monomethylated at position H3K4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This process coincides with paternal DNA demethylation in the mouse zygote. In addition, particular histone modifications such as di/trimethylation at H3K9, H4K20 and H3K27 are only present on the maternal chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This asymmetry between parental genomes, particular of DNA methylation and H3K9me2, persists until at least the two-cell stage of mouse embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Direct comparative epigenetic studies are still scarce for mammalian species. In our studies we therefore analyzed the dynamics of H3K9me2 and H3K4me3 methylation along with DNA methylation alterations in mouse, bovine and rabbit zygotes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Dynamics of DNA methylation in mouse, bovine and rabbit zygotes</title><p>To compare the developmental dynamics of DNA methylation in pronuclei of mouse, rabbit and bovine zygotes we performed indirect immunofluorescence using well-characterized &#x003b1;-5meC-specific monoclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Mouse and bovine zygotes were obtained by <italic>in vitro </italic>fertilization. Rabbit zygotes were derived from superovulated females, naturally mated with males. In all three species we found a clear asymmetry of &#x003b1;-5meC staining between the parental pronuclei at advanced stages of zygotic development (more than 6 hours after fertilization). Whereas the DNA of the maternal pronuclei and polar bodies retained a strong reactivity with the antibody, this reactivity was greatly reduced in all paternal pronuclei of the three species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). While the observed loss of DNA methylation signal in paternal DNA in mouse and bovine zygotes is in full agreement with previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the finding of a strong loss of DNA methylation signal in the paternal pronuclei of rabbit zygotes was unexpected. We therefore carefully re-examined rabbit zygotes at different time points (pronuclear stages) after fertilization. At early stages of development, starting from decondensing sperm and maternal metaphase DNA (PN0-1) up to early expanding stages (PN2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), both paternal and maternal chromosomes are strongly stained with the &#x003b1;-5meC antibody. In mouse the &#x003b1;-5meC signal is already greatly reduced at the PN2 stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Upon further expansion of the pronuclei (PN3-4) the &#x003b1;-5meC signal intensity decreases substantially in the paternal but remains unchanged in the maternal pronucleus, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). To validate this visual assessment we quantified the loss of paternal methylation on digital immunofluorescence images of zygotes collected approximately 6 to 8 hours after fertilization. The signal intensities of &#x003b1;-5meC antibody and propidium iodide DNA staining were measured for both paternal and maternal pronuclear areas in individual zygotes and the relative intensity ratios were calculated. Out of approximately 30 PN3-4-staged zygotes obtained, only 14 had non-overlaying pronuclei and hence qualified for ratio determination. In all 14 cases the paternal pronuclei consistently showed a reduction of &#x003b1;-5meC to DNA signal ratio (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) to an average ratio of 0.51 as compared with matching maternal pronuclei ratio (set as 1). Maternal and paternal pronuclei at earlier stages (PN2, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) exhibited approximately identical intensity ratios (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>DNA and histone H3 methylation in mouse, bovine and rabbit zygotes at advanced pronuclear stages</bold>.

The extent and dynamics of this demethylation is slightly different compared with the mouse. A recent report by Park et al corroborates this interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We can only speculate as to why previous publications came to the different interpretation that a paternal genome-wide DNA demethylation is absent in early rabbit embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. One explanation for this discrepancy may be that the images analyzed in both previous publications show zygotes at rather early developmental stages, that is, at pronuclear stages before we observe DNA demethylation to commence. In addition, the different fixation method used in one of the previous studies may have contributed to the apparently different interpretation of images. We have applied the fixation method used by Shi et al (2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] on mouse zygotes and found it to frequently produce incomplete cellular or nuclear membrane breakdown. In particular we often observed inconsistent pronuclear morphology and highly variable signals in &#x003b1;-5meC staining (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Dynamics of DNA demethylation in rabbit one-cell embryos following somatic nuclear transfer</title><p>To obtain further proof for a demethylation activity in rabbit oocytes we examined one-cell embryos produced by nuclear transfer (NT) using rabbit fetal fibroblasts as nuclear donors. As in naturally fertilized zygotes, we found an already strong reduction of the &#x003b1;-5meC signal in pronuclei of NT embryos at 4 hours after activation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, respectively). The majority of rabbit NT embryos showed a strong loss of methylation signal in the donor DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and only a few escaped demethylation almost entirely (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Similar variable demethylation was reported for NT-derived bovine embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Among NT embryos with only partial demethylation we found a remarkable example in which the transferred single donor nucleus formed two separate pronuclei. Only one of these pronuclei was demethylated at the time of fixation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). For the majority of one-cell NT embryos we estimated at least a four to six-fold decrease of &#x003b1;-5meC signal intensity as measured by DNA/immunofluorescence signal ratios using ImageJ software-based calculations. To exclude that the observed strong reduction of the &#x003b1;-5meC signal in the paternal pronucleus and in NT embryos might be due to selective antibody reactivity and sensitivity we performed a second series of experiments using a different polyclonal &#x003b1;-5meC antibody and obtained identical results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Anti-5meC immunostaining of rabbit one-cell nuclear transfer embryos</bold>.

The reasons for the 'delayed' demethylation in zygotes remain unclear. It is possible that a completed protamine-histone exchange (1 to 2 hours) is required for demethylation to commence in the zygotes. The chromosomes of donor fibroblast are already in such a histone-containing chromatin state, which allows a more rapid demethylation process. However, it has been shown that also donor nuclei undergo considerable changes upon transfer into enucleated oocytes, including chromosomal decondensation and histone H1 exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>To obtain independent proof for the presence of a DNA demethylation activity in the rabbit oocyte we performed comparative bisulfite sequencing analyses with DNA of one-cell NT embryos and fibroblast donor cells, respectively. In particular we examined L1Oc7(8) sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], a variant of LINE1 elements, shown to be partially demethylated in mouse zygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and <italic>Rsat IIE </italic>satellite sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The sequencing data revealed that the overall methylation of L1Oc7(8) decreases from 79% in fibroblasts to 57% in NT embryos and from 39% to 13%, respectively in <italic>Rsat IIE </italic>sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) (see Methods) at two CpG positions within the L1Oc7 amplicons confirmed the sequencing results (data not shown). A detailed analysis of the methylation patterns of L1Oc7(8) and <italic>Rsat IIE </italic>clones (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) shows that some CpGs in L1Oc7(8) sequences are more resistant to demethylation than others, and the overall methylation pattern is often mosaic (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Bisulfite sequencing data</bold>.

However, the extent of demethylation as determined by bisulfite sequencing for repetitive elements is not as pronounced as the significant loss of &#x003b1;-5meC antibody reactivity suggested in immunostainings (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). One explanation for this apparent discrepancy might be that a gradual reduction of approximately 25% of co-methylated CpGs within repetitive elements may strongly influence the immunofluorescence detection by &#x003b1;-5meC antibodies. Indeed, Weber et al showed that efficient immunoprecipitation by &#x003b1;-5meC antibodies requires at least five methylated CpGs to be in proximity on the same strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>H3K9me2 and H3K4me3 in late zygotes and early two-cell embryos of all three species</title><p>Immunohistochemical analysis of mouse, bovine and rabbit late-stage zygotes with antibodies against H3K9me2 revealed that this type of histone modification is exclusively associated with maternal pronuclei in all three species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). We conclude that not only the pronuclear asymmetry of DNA methylation but also the asymmetry of H3K9me2 appears to be ubiquitous for late-stage zygotes of different mammalian species. Given that the maternal pronuclear DNA is refractory to demethylation, H3K9me2 could possibly generate a chromatin environment that protects the maternal chromosomes against demethylation. Other histone modifications such as H3 hypoacetylation may also contribute to this mechanism. This speculation is supported by the work of Spinaci et al who observed a positive influence of histone hyperacetylation on demethylation of maternal DNA in the mouse zygote [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>H3K4me3 is found to be strongly associated with both maternal and paternal genomes in mouse, bovine and rabbit zygotes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This modification is attributed to the transcriptionally active chromatin. It is known that in the mouse embryonic genome activation (EGA) starts in late zygotes and reaches its maximum at the two-cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The accumulation of H3K4me3 in late mouse zygotes may indicate the onset of transcriptional activity. The identical patterns in bovine and rabbit zygotes do not support this interpretation, since the EGA in these species does not occur before the eight- to 16-cell stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The different epigenetic signatures of paternal and maternal genomes established in zygotic pronuclei are maintained for at least one to two further cell divisions. Using epigenetic profiles such as DNA methylation and H3K9me2 as 'markers', spatially separated chromosomes can be observed in mouse two- and four-cell preimplantation embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Indeed, using an H3K9me2-specific antibody we observed a similar spatial compartmentalization in bovine and rabbit early two-cell embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Overall, the pronuclear distributions and dynamics of the analyzed histone modifications are rather similar between mouse, rabbit and bovine zygotes.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>H3K9me2 distribution in mouse (A), bovine (B) and rabbit (C) early two-cell embryos</bold>.

In rabbit zygotes the paternal chromosomes are significantly demethylated at advanced pronuclear stages. We also show that the dynamics of chromatin modifications are conserved in zygotes of mice, cattle and rabbit. Together these findings allow us to conclude that the basic mechanisms of epigenetic reprogramming are conserved in zygotes of these three mammalian species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were carried out according to the German Animal Welfare law in agreement with the authorizing committee.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>fertilization and culture of mouse oocytes</title><p>(C57BL/6 &#x000d7; CBA)F1 adult mice were used as donors of sperm and oocytes.
