            a broadly protective HPV vaccine yet the titers obtained in most experimental systems
            are rather low. Here we examine the potential of empty AAV2 particles (AAVLPs), assembled
            from VP3 alone, for display of L2 epitopes to enhance their immunogenicity. Insertion
            of a neutralizing epitope (amino acids 17–36) from L2 of HPV16 and HPV31 into VP3
            at positions 587 and 453, respectively, permitted assembly into empty AAV particles
            (AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)). Intramuscularly vaccination of mice and rabbits with AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)s
            in montanide adjuvant, induced high titers of HPV16 L2 antibodies as measured by ELISA.
            Sera obtained from animals vaccinated with the AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)s neutralized infections
            with several HPV types in a pseudovirion infection assay. Lyophilized AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)
            particles retained their immunogenicity upon reconstitution. Interestingly, vaccination
            of animals that were pre-immunized with AAV2 - simulating the high prevalence of AAV2
            antibodies in the population - even increased cross neutralization against HPV31,
            45 and 58 types. Finally, passive transfer of rabbit antisera directed against AAVLP(HPV16/31L2)s
            protected naïve mice from vaginal challenge with HPV16 pseudovirions. In conclusion,
            AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) particles have the potential as a broadly protective vaccine candidate
            regardless of prior exposure to AAV.

         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been linked to the development
            of cervical cancer 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-ZurHausen1">[1]</span>. Attempts to prevent infection with the most prevalent high risk HPV types – HPV16
            and HPV18 – led to the development of two highly efficacious HPV vaccines that comprise
            virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled from the major capsid protein L1. However these
            vaccines target only two of the 15 high-risk HPV types, responsible for 70–80% of
            cervical cancer cases. The prevention of 96% of cervical cancer would require the
            immunity against at least 7 high-risk HPV types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58),
            but this increases the cost and complexity of manufacture 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Munoz1">[2]</span>. Future vaccines should therefore attempt to extend immunization against other high-risk
            HPV types. For broad application also in developing countries they should be provided
            inexpensively in a temperature stable formulation.
         </p>
         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The minor capsid protein L2 harbors several regions that can be targeted by neutralizing
            antibodies 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Rubio1">[3]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Kondo1">[5]</span>. One of which, located at amino acid position 17–36 comprises a major cross-neutralizing
            epitope and thus represents an attractive candidate antigen for broadly protective
            vaccination 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Campo1">[6]</span>–
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Roden1">[8]</span>. However, the major challenge in using the L2 protein as vaccine antigen is its rather
            poor immunogenicity compared to L1 VLP. It has been attempted to increase the immunogenicity
            of L2, by the use of different scaffolds 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Rubio1">[3]</span>,

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Alphs1">[10]</span> or by using a concatenated L2 N-terminal fragment

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Adeno-associated virus (AAV) belongs to the parvovirus family harboring a single-stranded
            DNA genome of approximately 4.7 kb. AAV particles that are very stable over a wide
            range of pH and temperature have a diameter of 25 nm, and are composed of 60 capsid
            protein subunits, designated VP1, VP2, and VP3 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Xie1">[12]</span>. A recent study demonstrated that assembly of AAV capsids requires the expression
            of a virally encoded assembly-activating protein (AAP) 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Sonntag1">[13]</span>. Moreover, co-expression of VP3 with AAP allows the efficient production of virus-like
            particles (AAVLPs) composed of only the major capsid protein VP3 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Sonntag1">[13]</span>. These capsids adopt an identical external capsid structure as VP1, VP2 and VP3 containing
            capsids 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Sonntag2">[14]</span> and represent a preferred scaffold for peptide vaccination, because of their simplicity
            and their inability to transfer genes which may inadvertently have been packaged in
            such AAVLPs. Due to the highly structured and repetitive presentation of epitopes
            on the capsid (60 times), combined with the intrinsic immunogenicity of AAV 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Boutin1">[15]</span>, potent B-cell responses against the peptide presented at immunogenic capsid positions
            can be expected. So far, AAV capsids have not been analyzed for this purpose.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Here we show for the first time the potential to present B-cell epitopes on AAVLP
            capsid surface. We generated AAVLPs displaying HPV16 L2 epitopes in position 587 and
            HPV31 L2 epitopes in position 453. Our results demonstrate cross-neutralizing responses
            against several HPV types and therefore suggest AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) particles as a broadly
            protective vaccine candidate.

               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Naumer1">[22]</span> that are attractive sites for presenting B-cell epitopes.The expression of only two
               AAV proteins, VP3 and AAP, allows the formation of VP3-VLPs (AAVLPs). These observations
               suggest that recombinant AAVLPs could be generated with insertions of peptides in
               positions 587 and 453. After immunization with HPV16 L2 peptide 17–36 a broad range
               of cross- neutralizing antibodies was generated, but low or no antibodies against
               HPV31 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Gambhira1">[23]</span>. Since HPV L2 17–36 aa sequences of HPV16 and 31 are clearly different, we incorporated
               both HPV L2 peptides into AAVLP particles at position 587 and 453 (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g001">figure 1A</span>). Stretches of 3 or 5 glycine residues were added to the N and C termini of the respective
               peptides for optimal surface display and several amino acids resulting from restriction
               enzyme sites used for cloning increased the size of inserted peptide sequences to
               35 aa (position 453) and 31 aa (position 587). The amino acids at positions 585 and
               588 were substituted. These R585A/R588A substitutions increased the titers of AAVLP
               particles with inserts. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of AAVLPs confirmed the
               identity and size (approximately 66 kDa of AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) VP3) of the purified
               protein (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g001">figure 1B</span>). Presentation of the inserted HPV L2 peptides on the AAVLP particles were demonstrated
               with L2-specific rabbit sera in a dot blot assay under native conditions. However,
               since these sera cross-react with the HPV16 and HPV31 displayed peptides, exposure
               of both of them could not be unambiguously proven. As shown in 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g001">figure 1C</span>, proteins assembled into VLPs of ∼25–30 nm in diameter. In conclusion, the insertions
               of 35 aa (position 453) and 31 aa (position 587) into the capsid protein did not interfere
               with VLP assembly.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Neutralization was determined by inhibition of gene transduction by pseudovirions
               (PsV) containing the gene for gaussia luciferase (gLuc). Transduction was measured
               by gLuc expression which is taken as a surrogate of infection. The sera were tested
               in serial dilutions from 1∶40 to 1∶30,720, and a 50% reduction of gLuc activity was
               defined as positive neutralization. As shown in 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g003">figure 3A</span>, the enhancing effect of the adjuvant was also evident from the neutralizing activity
               against HPV16 and HPV31, but the HPV31-specific neutralization was weaker. Future
               HPV vaccines should induce immunity against other high-risk HPV types. We therefore
               analysed the ability of our particles to induce cross-neutralizing antibodies against
               several PsV (HPV18, HPV45, HPV52 and HPV58). As shown in

               antibodies against HPV18, HPV45, HPV52 and HPV58. Animals vaccinated with TrXL2+M
               did not develop cross-neutralizing antibodies. We conclude from these results that
               neutralizing activity against HPV16 induced by the particles is higher than the one
               to HPV31. Cross-neutralization can only be achieved with adjuvanted AAVLPs. Reactivity
               of sera from mice immunized with AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) particles was higher than TrXL2
               in C57BL/6 mice.

            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">Cross-neutralizing activity of AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) was more closely analyzed in Balb/c
               mice, to this end animals were immunized with low dose of AAVLP plus montanide ISA51
               two (LD+M 2x) or three times (LD+M 3x). In order to test the potency of another adjuvant
               a group of mice were vaccinated three times i.m. with low dose of AAVLP together with
               monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL) (LD+MPL). Animals vaccinated with TrXL2 plus montanide
               ISA51 (TrXL2+ M) or with one of the two licensed HPV vaccines, Cervarix™ and Gardasil™
               (1/10 of the dose recommended for humans) were used as controls.
            </p>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">A potential challenge for using AAV2-based vaccines in humans is the naturally acquired
               immune responses in approximately 80% of the human population (
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Calcedo1">[24]</span>,

               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Boutin1">[15]</span>), as the presence of antibodies against the AAV capsid may prevent an efficient vaccination.
               Therefore we immunized a group of animals with AAV2 (1E+11 particles/animal) prior
               to vaccination with AAVLP. Two and four weeks after pre-immunization, antibodies reacting
               with AAV2 capsids were detected by ELISA (titers between 80 and 1000) (
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g004">figure 4</span>). At week 4 animals were vaccinated with LD+M 3x. Generation of HPV16 L2 specific
               antibodies was measured by a GST-L2 ELISA two weeks after the last immunization. As
               shown in 
               <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0039741-g005">figure 5</span>, mice immunized with two or three doses of AAVLPs as well as with TrXL2+M developed
               comparable high titers of L2-specific antibodies (&gt;100,000). Interestingly, also after
               pre-immunization with AAV similar titer levels were measured. The requirements for
               vaccines that are stable at ambient temperature imply the development of freeze-dried
               formulations may be beneficial. Lyophilized and rehydrated AAVLP(HPV16/31L2) particles
               were shown to be only slightly less immunogenic compared to the unprocessed particles.
               Animals vaccinated in the presence of MPL developed around one log lower HPV16 L2-specific
               antibody titers (&lt;10,000) than mice which received montanide ISA51 adjuvanted particles.

         <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">The first steps in papillomavirus infection involve L1 dependent binding of the viral
            capsid to heparan sulfate proteoglycan 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Johnson1">[26]</span> and lamin 5 in the extracellular matrix 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Culp1">[27]</span> which induces a conformational change leading to the exposure of L2, furin dependent
            proteolytic processing and attachment to keratinocytes 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Day1">[28]</span>, 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Day2">[29]</span>. Intervention with this infection pathway by prophylactic vaccination has two possible
            targets, the L1 or the L2 protein of the HPV capsid. While L1 antibodies are able
            to prevent both steps – attachment to basal membrane and to keratinocytes – L2 antibodies
            can interfere only with binding to the keratinocytes. L1 antibodies can be induced
            to high neutralization titers, especially when generated by HPV-VLPs, however, they
            have the drawback of HPV-type restriction. Furthermore, L1 VLPs are expensive to produce,
            especially for highly multivalent vaccines, and distribution of such vaccines requires
            a cold chain which limits their adoption by developing countries. Thus, although two
            approved L1 HPV-VLP vaccines – Gardasil™ and Cervarix™ – are highly protective against
            the main high-risk HPV infections, they lack cross-protection against other, more
            rare high-risk HPV types, they are not heat stable and are expensive to produce. L2
            vaccines on the other hand, are able to expand the cross-protection profile due to
            extensive homology of the N terminus of L2 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Gambhira2">[30]</span>. In particular, oligopeptides of the L2 proteins are sufficient to induce a broadly
            cross-neutralizing immune response 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Pastrana1">[31]</span>. However, neutralizing titers generated by L2 peptides are relatively low compared
            to those produced by L1VLPs

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Mitchell1">[20]</span>. In this first exploration of AAVLPs as a vaccine for generating a humoral immune
            response, the anti-peptide titers obtained were remarkably high (in the range of 10
            <sup>4</sup> to 10
            <sup>5</sup>) after two immunizations with only 0.6 µg VLPs per dose. A third immunization only
            slightly increased the anti-L2 peptide titers. Nevertheless, an adjuvant seems to
            be required for AAVLP vaccination, because the recombinant AAV capsid alone elicits
            only a weak or no innate immune response. So far, only one alternative adjuvant (MPL)

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Guy1">[35]</span>. Pre-existence of anti AAV antibodies which are highly prevalent in the human populations,
            rather boosts than prevents the generation of the L2 specific immune response. This
            could be explained by improved, anti-AAV antibody Fc-mediated uptake of AAVLPs by
            professional antibody presenting cells. A particular advantage of AAVLPs is their
            stability which allows lyophilization and rehydration 
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Kuck1">[36]</span>. Thus, lyophilization of AAVLPs likely permits storage and delivery of AAVLPs under
            harsh conditions and in principle circumvents the need of a cold chain for vaccine
            distribution. This may be an important cost factor in developing countries and should
            be further explored.

            at two separate positions of the same capsid provided a broadly cross-neutralizing
            antiserum, as tested in a pseudovirion (PsV) infection assay. This was observed in
            C57BL/6 mice, Balb/c mice and in rabbits. The HPV16-L2 peptide inserted at 587 provided
            nearly 100% protection against HPV16 PsV infection with rather high neutralizing antibody
            titers. This was not the case for the HPV31-L2 peptide inserted at aa position 453
            and tested in the HPV31 PsV-based neutralization assay. The result is in agreement
            with the study of Jagu et al. that showed that a multitype L2 fusion protein which
            included a peptide of HPV31 induced robust antibody titers against various HPV types,

            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Jagu1">[11]</span>. However, also the position of peptide insertion in the AAV capsid may play a role.
            Peptides at position 453 are more exposed on the AAV capsid surface and have a larger
            interpeptide distance at the threefold symmetry axis of AAV2 than peptides inserted
            at aa 587. Immunization with the same peptides inserted at the reversed positions
            should show whether the inherent immunogenicity of the two peptides or the localization
            on the capsid surface is responsible for the difference in the immune reaction. Such
            an analysis might provide valuable information for the optimal spatial arrangement
            of antigenic epitopes on viral scaffolds for vaccination.

               <i>Xho</i>I and 
               <i>Not</i>I site of the pCI plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The start codon of VP2 was destroyed
               by introducing a point-mutation using the Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit
               (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA). A

               acid number relative to the VP1 protein of AAV2) to generate the plasmid pCIVP2mut.
               In order to introduce peptides into VP3 the plasmid pCIVP2mut was modified. The plasmid

               HPV16 L1 and L2 genes, together with a plasmid containing the gene for gLuc under
               the control of CMV promoter. For PsV extraction, 293TT cells were harvested and washed
               once with 1 ml of Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; Gibco). The cell pellet
               was resuspended in 150 µl of lysis buffer (140 µl DBPS, 9 µl 10% Brij58 (w/v) (Sigma)
               and 1 µl RNAse A/T cocktail (Fermentas)). The PsV-containing supernatant was set aside
               and the cell pellet was resuspended anew in 300 µl DPBS/0.8 M NaCl. Samples were cleared
               by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm and 4°C for 10 minutes. The supernatants were combined,
               2 µl benzonase were added and the samples were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The PsV
               were Optiprep purified and used for infection of HeLaT cells.

            <h3>In Vivo Pseudovirus Delivery and Infection</h3>
            <p xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">HPV16 pseudovirions with encapsulated luciferase reporter were generated by cotransfection
               of 293TT cells with plasmids encoding codon-modified L1 and L2 and a firefly luciferase
               reporter plasmid, as described previously 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Pastrana2">[40]</span>. Female Balb/c mice were treated with 3 mg of Depo-provera (Pfizer) 4 days prior
               to viral challenge. One day prior to challenge, mice were injected i.p. with buffer,
               undiluted rabbit antisera or 20 µg of purified RG-1 monoclonal antibody. The mice
               were anesthetized and challenged with pseudovirus as previously described 
               <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0039741-Roberts1">[42]</span>, but with modifications. Briefly, a HPV16 PsV inoculum of 20 µl mixed with 20 µl
               of a 3% CMC preparation, based on L1 content, was used. The inoculum was delivered
               using an M20 positive-displacement pipette in two doses; 20 µl before and 20 µl after
               insertion in the vagina of a Cytobrush that was turned clockwise and counterclockwise
               10 times. After the challenge, standard dissecting forceps were used to occlude the
               vaginal introitus to achieve maximal retention of the material while the mice recover
               from anesthesia. Three days after pseudovirion challenge, the mice were again anesthetized
               and 20 µl of luciferin (7.8 mg/ml) was deposited in the vaginal vault. Luciferase
               signals were acquired for 10 min with a Xenogen IVIS 100 imager, and analysis was
               performed with Living Image 2.0 software (Caliper Life Sciences). An identical region
               of interest (ROI) was drawn around the luciferase signal emitted from each mouse,
               and the average radiance within the ROI was determined.
