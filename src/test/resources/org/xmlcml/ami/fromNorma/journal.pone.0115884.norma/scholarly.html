      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
         				The Indonesian island of Sulawesi in central Indonesia is home to a
         				largely unstudied radiation of fanged frogs in the genus
         				
         <i>Limnonectes</i>
         				Fitzinger, 1843 (Anura: Dicroglossidae Anderson, 1871). To date,
         				only three species are recognized from Sulawesi, but at least 15
         				species occur on the island
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Emerson1">[1]</span>
         				,

         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Setiadi1">[3]</span>
         				. It was recently proposed that Sulawesi fanged frogs represent an
         				adaptive radiation based on patterns of morphological
         				diversification among co-distributed species, and correspondence of
         				morphological features (body size, webbing) with habitat utilization
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Setiadi1">[3]</span>
         				. Adult body size ranges from ∼2 g to more than 900 g in members of
         				the Sulawesi assemblage, with large-bodied species found in close
         				association with fast moving rivers, and small-bodied species
         				occupying more terrestrial niches in forest leaf-litter and on the
         				banks of slow moving streams. Iskandar and Tjan
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Iskandar1">[4]</span>
         				first documented that there are multiple undescribed species of
         				
         <i>Limnonectes</i>
         				on Sulawesi, and indicated that one of the constituent species
         				utilizes an unusual ovoviviparous reproductive strategy. Here we
         				describe that species, and provide additional details on its
         				reproductive mode.
         			
      </p>
      <p>
         				Anurans exhibit tremendous diversity in mode of reproduction. Not
         				only have there been many independent origins of direct development,
         				the condition in which a free-living tadpole stage is bypassed and
         				froglets emerge from the egg capsules
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wake1">[5]</span>
         				, but a bewildering array of mechanisms has evolved wherein parents
         				care for their developing offspring. Examples of parental care
         				include guarding of terrestrial eggs, transport of tadpoles on the
         				back following hatching, carrying developing eggs in pouches or
         				depressions on the back and flanks, males carrying developing
         				tadpoles in the vocal sac, and even the now-extinct species of
         				gastric brooding frogs in which the female carried her developing
         				tadpoles in her stomach (see
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Haddad1">[6]</span>
         				for a summary). Despite this extreme reproductive diversity,
         				internal fertilization has evolved only a few times among the 6455
         				known species of anurans
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-AmphibiaWeb1">[7]</span>
         				,
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-McDiarmid1">[8]</span>
         				. Only the African bufonid genera
         				
         <i>Nectophrynoides</i>
         				and
         				
         <i>Nimbaphrynoides</i>
         				and the now extinct Puerto Rican species,
         				
         <i>Eleutherodactylus jasperi</i>
         				, are documented to combine internal fertilization with egg
         				retention and subsequent birth of froglets
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wells1">[9]</span>
         				. To this group, we can now add a species of Sulawesi fanged frog in
         				the genus
         				
         <i>Limnonectes</i>
         				with internal fertilization and live birth of tadpoles, a
         				reproductive mode that is unique among anurans.

      <h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
      <p>
         				We analyzed more than 100 specimens representing the new species
         				from 23 localities on the island of Sulawesi. This study was
         				conducted under an approved Institutional Animal Care and Use
         				Committee protocol issued to JAM by the University of California at
         				Berkeley (Protocol #R279). Fieldwork conducted in Indonesia was
         				undertaken under research permits issued by LIPI and RISTEK, with
         				specimen exportation authorized under permits or loans issued by
         				LIPI, the Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense, and Pusat Studi Biologi.
         				Specimens were captured by hand in the field, sacrificed via
         				emersion in an aqueous solution of MS-222 (tricaine methane
         				sulfonate) buffered to neutral pH, and prepared as formalin-fixed
         				specimens deposited primarily in the Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense
         				(the national museum of Indonesia) or Museum of Vertebrate Zoology
         				at UC Berkeley. As part of a comprehensive study of Sulawesi
         				
         <i>Limnonectes</i>
         				diversification, we obtained morphometric data for the full Sulawesi
         				assemblage. Sex was determined by inspection of gonads. The
         				following measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital
         				calipers: snout-vent length (SVL) – from cloaca to tip of snout;
         				head width (HW) – widest distance between posterior end of lower
         				jaw; head length (HL) – from posterior end of lower jaw to tip of
         				snout; femur length (FE) – from cloaca to distal end of femur; tibia
         				length (TI) – from knee to distal end of tibia; foot length (FL) –
         				from distal end of tibia-fibula to tip of 4th toe; inner metatarsal
         				tubercle (IM); humerus length (UA) – from proximal end of upper arm
         				to elbow; lower arm length (LA) – from elbow joint to base of middle
         				palmar tubercle; hand length (HA) – from lower border of middle
         				tubercle to distal tip of third finger; snout length (SL) – from
         				bony border of eye socket to tip of snout; snout width at eye level
         				(SWE); snout width at nostril level (SWN); eye diameter (EY) – outer
         				diameter, measured from bones bordering eye; interorbital distance
         				(IO) – distance between orbits ( = width of frontoparietal bones);
         				eye-tympanum distance (ET); eye-narial distance (EN) – eye socket
         				border to posterior border of nostril; Internarial distance (IN) –
         				shortest distance between nostrils; nostril to tip of snout (NT);
         				tympanum diameter (TY); odontoid process length (OP) –length of
         				fang-like odontoid process of lower jaw; tibia diameter measured at
         				its widest point (TD). Digital webbing formulae from

         <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
         <p>
            					Prior workers have recognized substantial species diversity in the
            					genus
            					
            <i>Limnonectes</i>
            					on Sulawesi. However, diagnosing many of these lineages on the
            					basis of morphology is challenging, and several authors have
            					instead opted to apply names to Sulawesi specimens representing
            					species from outside Sulawesi. Consequently, the following names
            					have all been incorrectly applied to Sulawesi populations: the
            					Lesser Sundas species (type locality: Flores Island)
            					
            <i>L. dammermani</i>
            					(Mertens, 1927), the Bornean species
            					
            <i>L. finchii</i>
            					(Inger, 1966), the Mollucan species (type locality: Ambon)
            					
            <i>L. grunniens</i>
            					(Daudin, 1801), and the Philippine taxa
            					
            <i>L. leytensis</i>
            					(Boettger, 1893),
            					
            <i>L. magnus</i>
            					(Stejneger, 1909), and
            					
            <i>L. palavanensis</i>
            					(Boulenger, 1894). These names should not be applied to Sulawesi
            					populations, as was verified phylogenetically for several of these
            					taxa
            					
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Setiadi1">[3]</span>
            					. Only four Sulawesi species have been described:
            					
            <i>L. arathooni</i>
            					(Smith, 1927),
            					
            <i>L. heinrichi</i>
            					(Ahl, 1933),
            					
            <i>L. modestus</i>
            					(Boulenger, 1882), and
            					
            <i>L. microtympanum</i>
            					(van Kampen, 1909). However, we will show elsewhere that
            					
            <i>L. heinrichi</i>
            					is a junior synonym of
            					
            <i>L. modestus</i>
            					and the species complex that we have referred to previously

            <i>Limnonectes larvaepartus</i>

            <i>Limnonectes</i>
            					by its reproductive mode (
            					
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115884-g002">Fig. 2</span>
            					). It can be further differentiated from all described Sulawesi
            					species by its combination of body size (mean male SVL = 37.4;
            					female SVL = 40.2 mm), coloration, tympanum size, and degree of
            					hind foot webbing, as well as on the basis of phylogenetic
            					placement (
            					
            <span ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0115884-g003">Fig. 3</span>

            <i>Limnonectes arathooni</i>
            					is endemic to Sulawesi's Southwestern (SW) Peninsula south of the
            					Tempe Depression, and thus does not occur within the range of
            					
            <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
            					. It is similar in size to the new species (male SVL = 36.6 mm,
            					females = 39.6 mm), but differs in having substantially reduced
            					webbing (extending to penultimate phalange of fourth toe vs. to toe
            					disc), in lacking fine granular dorsal tubercles, and in having
            					melanic spots above the forelimb insertion, a fine ridge extending
            					posteriorly behind each eye, and an alternative derived
            					reproductive mode in which males guard clutches of terrestrial eggs
            					that hatch into tadpoles that then make their own way to an
            					adjacent stream by sliding down steep stream-side embankments
            					
            <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Brown1">[14]</span>

            					thus much larger than the new species.
            					
            <i>Limnonectes microtympanum</i>
            					also differs from the new species in having proportionally smaller
            					tympana (TY/SVL = 0.05

            <i>L. modestus</i>
            					, which is a moderate sized (male SVL = 70.2 mm; female SVL = 64.0
            					mm) inhabitant of fast-moving streams and substantially larger than
            					
            <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
            					. Like

            <i>Limnonectes modestus</i>
            					also exhibits a derived reproductive mode involving production of a

            					represents the contents of just one oviduct. The eggs lack a

            <i>Limnonectes larvaepartus</i>

            					generally in sympatry with at least one, and sometimes as many as
            					five other
            					
            <i>Limnonectes</i>
            					species. In the western Central Core of Sulawesi, we have always
            					found
            					
            <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
            					living in sympatry with a much larger species that has been
            					referred to in the literature as
            					
            <i>L.</i>
            					sp.
            					
            <i>D</i>
            					(2,3). Whereas
            					
            <i>L.</i>
            					sp.
            					
            <i>D</i>
            					is generally found on rocks in fast-moving streams or within a
            					meter of water on the banks of fast-flowing streams,
            					
            <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
            					is usually found further from the stream (2–10 meters from water)
            					on rocky substrates, in leaf-litter, or secluded in grassy
            					vegetation. Because we have observed that

            					is unclear whether some or all of the observed tadpoles were sired
            					by the accompanying male. We have furthermore collected at least
            					one pregnant female from a small stream-side puddle already
            					inhabited by tadpoles of two size classes, again suggesting the
            					possibility that individual pools may be visited repeatedly by the

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
         				We first became aware of the unusual reproductive mode of
         				
         <i>Limnonectes larvaepartus</i>
         				while conducting fieldwork on Sulawesi. In several instances, we
         				discovered tadpoles in the oviducts while preparing specimens. In
         				each case, having sacrificed frogs for preparation, the abdominal
         				wall was observed to quiver, and incision resulted in living
         				tadpoles emerging from the opening (see
         				
         <span ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0115884.s001">S1 Movie</span>
         				). On one occasion, a gravid female gave birth to tadpoles in-hand
         				at the moment of capture. On four other occasions, field-collected
         				
         <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
         				in our possession gave birth to tadpoles while being held
         				individually in collecting bags. In total, we have either observed
         				tadpoles in the oviducts or direct-birth of tadpoles on 19
         				occasions.
         			
      </p>
      <p>
         				Because we have not witnessed natural birth of tadpoles in
         				free-living frogs, two possible alternative reproductive modes are
         				possible for this species.
         				
         <i>Limnonectes larvaepartus</i>
         				reproduction may simply reflect what we have observed in the hand –
         				direct birth of tadpoles. Alternatively, this species may be capable
         				of retaining developing young in the oviducts through metamorphosis
         				with subsequent birth of froglets, as is the case for
         				
         <i>Eleutherodactylus jasperi</i>
         				and members of the African bufonid genera
         				
         <i>Nectophrynoides</i>

         				. The latter mode seems unlikely for several reasons. First, we have
         				collected 19 pregnant individuals carrying tadpoles in the oviducts
         				but none carrying froglets. These 19 females were collected across
         				different months, years, and localities. Second, we have observed
         				and collected at least four clutches of free-living
         				
         <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
         				tadpoles in small pools of water on the margins of streams, with
         				each of these samples exhibiting two or three size classes and thus
         				possibly representing multiple clutches. Three of these clutches
         				were accompanied by males, some of which were calling, and one was
         				found in association with the gravid female that gave birth to 55
         				tadpoles (some in the hand of JAM, others subsequently deposited in
         				a collecting bag). Finally, although adaptive plasticity has been
         				demonstrated for many frog species, whereby tadpoles or froglets are
         				capable of hatching from their eggs prematurely when attacked by
         				predators
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Warkentin1">[19]</span>
         				, this has only been documented for a single direct-developer,
         				
         <i>Eleutherodactylus coqui</i>
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Buckley1">[20]</span>
         				. In the case of
         				
         <i>E. coqui</i>
         				, the capacity for early hatching commenced at stages 13 or 14,
         				whereas normal hatching occurred at stage 15 (see
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Townsend1">[21]</span>
         				for staging). Thus,
         				
         <i>E. coqui</i>
         				were capable of premature hatching only as froglets, with toe pads
         				and eyelids present but before the tail was completely resorbed, a
         				stage much later than would be required by
         				
         <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
         				if it were simultaneously capable of hatching as either a tadpole or
         				full-term froglet. Most direct-developers, as well as the few frog
         				species that give birth to froglets, pass through the tadpole stage
         				in a form poorly suited for free-living. In many such species, the
         				tadpole has a broad, highly vascularized ‘respiratory tail’
         				specialized for intra-egg or intra-oviductal gas exchange rather
         				than for swimming, as is the case for
         				
         <i>Eleutherodactylus jasperi</i>
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Wake2">[17]</span>
         				, and may lack mouthparts and functional gills
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Lutz1">[22]</span>
         				,
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Lynn1">[23]</span>
         				,
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Thibaudeau1">[24]</span>
         				. In others, the tail remains rudimentary and limb buds appear early
         				in development such that a typical tadpole phenotype never occurs
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Lutz1">[22]</span>
         				,
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Lynn1">[23]</span>
         				. Given these observations, it appears unlikely that any one species
         				would be characterized by the combination of (1) internal
         				fertilization, (2) complete metamorphosis within the oviducts and
         				live-birth in the form of froglets, as well as (3) an oviductal
         				tadpole stage that is capable of premature birth and free-living.
         				Although we think that
         				
         <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
         				is much more likely to give birth to tadpoles as its sole mode of
         				reproduction as opposed to exhibiting adaptive plasticity allowing
         				for birth of either tadpoles or froglets depending on the
         				circumstances confronting the frog, we note that either condition
         				would be unique among Anura. In either case,
         				
         <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
         				requires internal fertilization, which is, itself, extremely rare
         				among anurans
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-McDiarmid1">[8]</span>
         				,
         				
         <span ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0115884-Duellman1">[25]</span>
         				. The mechanism by which internal fertilization takes place is
         				unknown, and there is no obvious intromittent organ present to
         				facilitate sperm transfer. If
         				
         <i>L. larvaepartus</i>
         				reproduction always involves birth of tadpoles, it is likely that
         				they are ovoviparous given that the tadpoles are well provisioned
         				with yolk and appear fully capable of developing without nutrient
         				transfer from the mother. Prior to parturition, the tadpoles have
         				well-developed tails and pigmentation, and well developed
         				mouthparts. Given this morphology, it is unlikely that these
         				tadpoles are endotrophic (never feed before metamorphosing into
         				froglets). It is more likely that the tadpoles are born after
         				exhausting their yolk supply, and are subsequently self-feeding
         				prior to metamorphosis. Nevertheless, it is clear that much remains
         				to be learned about this unusual frog, the discovery of which brings
         				to light yet another axis of diversity characterizing the remarkable
         				Sulawesi fanged frog adaptive radiation.
