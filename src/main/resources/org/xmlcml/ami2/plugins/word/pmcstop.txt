Despite this necessity, the reliable identification of mosquitoes is problematic in many cases, including the medically important <italic>Aedes simpsoni</italic> complex. This complex comprises three known species including <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>simpsoni</italic>, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic>. Among these three species, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> is an important vector of yellow fever virus (YFV) and potentially other arboviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Yellow fever has increased in incidence as a result of urbanisation and changes to public health policy [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The burden of yellow fever in Africa is estimated to be 130,000 cases a year, 85,000 of which result in deaths, despite the availability of a vaccine [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After mass immunisation campaigns at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, YFV was successfully reduced in targeted countries. However, YFV outbreaks are causing renewed attention. In West Africa, 13 out of 14 countries known to host YFV now report cases regularly and have experienced epidemics since 2000 [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Further concern has arisen over identification of a novel YFV genotype implicated in recent outbreaks including the first reported outbreak in Kenya, East Africa (1992&#x02013;1993) [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Related genotypes have also been reported in Sudan in 2003 and 2005 and more recently in northern Uganda in 2010 [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although much attention has been given to understanding yellow fever disease epidemiology [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], relatively little is known about the mosquito vectors.</p><p>Ten species are currently known within the wider Simpsoni Group (Huang 2004). Within this group, Theobald [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] originally described three species belonging to the Simpsoni Complex (<italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>simpsoni</italic>, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic>). Despite these separate species designations, many entomologists referred to all <italic>simpsoni</italic>-like mosquitoes within this complex as the nominotypical species, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>simpsoni</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In Uganda, it was found that some populations of <italic>Ae</italic>.<italic>simpsoni</italic> s.l. were anthropophilic and attracted to human bait, whereas others were not attracted to man despite local abundance [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, mosquitoes collected from zoophilic and anthropophilic populations showed different feeding preferences in the laboratory with a preference for rodents or humans, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These findings led to a re-examination of mosquito morphology and subsequently Huang [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] provided a full description of the component members of the Simpsoni Complex, reviewed their ecology and drew attention to the incorrect use of former nomenclature. <italic>Aedes simpsoni</italic>, which has only been reported from South Africa and Swaziland, is not implicated in human disease transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The anthropophilic yellow fever vector <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> is widespread on the African continent [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic>, only previously reported from Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda, has never been reported biting man and is thus not considered to be involved in disease transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although we know these three species have different distributions, biting behaviour and vectorial abilities, these need to be fully characterised. Understanding ecology and epidemiology requires that species can be distinguished from one another. However, controversy over mosquito taxonomy means that the anthropophilic disease transmitting <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> cannot be reliably distinguished from its zoophilic sister species <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Large scale detailed studies of the Simpsoni Complex by Huang [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], reported that <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>simpsoni</italic> s.s. can be distinguished from <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> in that it has simple claws on the mid tarsi, as opposed to toothed mid-tarsal claws present in the latter two taxa. <italic>Aedes simpsoni</italic> can also be easily distinguished from conspecifics by its distinct tarsomere scaling pattern [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, Jupp &#x00026; Kemp [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] reported variation in tarsal claw morphology of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>simpsoni</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic>, and questioned the reliability of this diagnostic character. In this study, we focus on the more widespread taxa of the complex, <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic>. These sister taxa can sometimes be reliably identified morphologically based on tarsomere banding patterns, but only when this character is exhibited at the extremes of its range as banding patterns overlap between the species [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Lutwama &#x00026; Mukwaya [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] questioned the usefulness of tarsomere banding patterns as a diagnostic character for <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic>. They observed variation in scale ornamentation on an almost continuous scale and found that progeny from the same mother could be identified both as <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> or <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> based on this morphological character.</p><p>The unreliability and practicality of using morphological based methods for routine field-based identification in the Simpsoni Complex has led to attempts to delimit species boundaries through molecular methods. In a study of the Simpsoni Complex, excluding the southerly distributed <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>simpsoni</italic>, Mukwaya <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found that anthropophilic populations from Kenya and Uganda form a distinct genetic clade separate from non-sympatric and non-anthropophilic populations from Uganda and Nigeria based on the non-coding internal transcribed spacer (<italic>ITS</italic>) region of ribosomal DNA. In that study, species were designated according to both blood feeding preference (because <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> is zoophilic whereas <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> are human vectors) and on tarsomere banding patterns which were distinctive for some specimens [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recently, Walter <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] inferred the presence of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> in sympatry in Rabai, Kenya based upon genetic differences between domestic/peri-domestic and forest populations. However, how these putative species relate to those characterised by Mukwaya <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] remains unclear as they used different molecular markers; two nuclear genes, apolipophorin 2 and cytochrome p450 (<italic>CYPJ92</italic>).</p><p>A 658 bp region of the cytochrome c oxidase (<italic>COI</italic>) gene has been widely adopted as a DNA barcoding standard for species identification because it shows high utility in discriminating between closely related taxa as well as resolving phylogeographic groups within species [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, sole use of mitochondrial DNA to delimit species has been questioned because of the potential for pseudogene development and introgression, which may limit the ability of mtDNA markers to resolve closely related species [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Combined analysis of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes can improve phylogenetic resolution since these markers evolve at different rates and so target different levels of the phylogenetic tree [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Another barcoding candidate is the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (<italic>ITS</italic>) regions of the ribosomal gene cistron that comprises the 18S, 5.8S, and 28S genes, an external spacer region and two internal spacer regions <italic>ITS1</italic> and <italic>ITS2</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The <italic>ITS</italic> regions evolve at a rapid rate in the absence of functional constraint [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Because they are tandemly repeated in the genome, the <italic>ITS</italic> spacer regions are also subject to concerted evolution whereby paralogues are homogenised by genetic exchange [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Consequently, paralogues remain genetically similar within species while showing high levels of interspecific divergence [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although not useful in all taxonomic groups, <italic>ITS</italic> can differentiate between sister species in a large number of cases and has been widely used to delimit closely related mosquitoes in <italic>Anopheles</italic> complexes [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>We seek to expand previous work on genetic differentiation of <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> in the Simpsoni Complex by determining how the putative species identified by Mukwaya <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Walter <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] relate to one another. We achieve this by sequencing the same mosquito samples at previously used molecular markers (<italic>apoLp2</italic>, <italic>CYPJ92</italic> and <italic>ITS</italic>).

id="sec012"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we used multiple markers to confirm there are two closely related species of the Simpsoni Complex that occur both allopatrically and sympatrically across the sampled range in sub-Saharan Africa. These species correspond to <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> of the Simpsoni Complex as characterised by Mukwaya <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We infer that a third forest taxon originally reported as <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> in Walter <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] relates to another species, possibly a another member of the Simpsoni Group. The development of a molecular species identification method for the YFV vector <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and non-vector <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic> using variation at the <italic>ITS</italic> region allowed us to make for the first time reliable inferences about mosquito ecology and distribution. Such information is vital for a complete understanding of disease transmission by these species.</p><p>All the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>simpsoni</italic> s.l. mosquitoes tested fell into one or other of two genetically divergent <italic>ITS</italic> lineages. Based on sequence similarity these correspond directly to the two lineages found by Mukwaya <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and we follow their previous designation as <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>bromeliae</italic> and <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>lilii</italic>. We consider their species designation to be reliable as it was based on both morphology and feeding preference. Firstly, even though some individuals could not be identified due to overlap in morphological characters, Mukwaya <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pntd.0004250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] were able to identify some
