               <p>The performance of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is often hindered by recruitment
                  difficulties. This study aims to explore the pre-screening phase of four prostate
                  cancer RCTs to identify the impact of a systematic pre-selection of eligible patients
                  for RCT recruitment.

               </div>
               <p>The pre-screening of four RCTs opened at the Comprehensive Cancer Center in Rennes
                  was analyzed retrospectively (French Genitourinary Tumor Group (GETUG) 14, 15, 16,
                  and 17). Data were extracted from electronic multidisciplinary cancer (MDC) reports
                  and manually completed by physicians and medical secretaries. These data were the
                  main source of information for clinicians to discuss treatment alternatives during
                  MDC sessions. The pre-screening decisions made by the clinicians during these MDC
                  meetings were compared with those made after a systematic review of the MDC reports
                  by a clinical research assistant (CRA). Any inconsistencies in decisions between the
                  CRA and the MDC physicians were corrected by the principal investigator (PI).

                  <h3>Results</h3>
               </div>
               <p>The pre-screening rate was 9.1% during the MDC meetings, while it was estimated to
                  be 12.9% after the final review by the PI, and 29% after the systematic review by
                  the CRA. The study showed that 77% and 67% of the MDC reports did not mention clinical
                  and pathological Tumor, lymph node and metastasis classification of malignant tumors
                  (TNM) staging, respectively, and that 35 of the CRA’s 47 proposals rejected by the
                  PI concerned implicit information (not specified in the MDC reports). Only one patient
                  was proposed by the PI, and none by the CRA.

                  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
               </div>
               <p>These results confirm that pre-screening could be improved by a systematic review
                  of the medical reports. They also highlight the fact that missing data in electronic
                  MDC reports leads to over-enrollment of non-eligible patients, but not to over-exclusion
                  of eligible patients. Thus, our study confirms the potential gain in using semi-automated
                  pre-selection of MDC reports, in order to avoid missing out on patients eligible for
                  RCTs.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the gold standard for evaluating the effects
         of healthcare procedures, but the performance of clinical RCTs is often hindered by
         recruitment difficulties 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. Inadequate recruitment causes delays, increases costs, reduces the statistical power
         of analysis and finally, may lead to failed clinical trials.
      </p>
      <p>Clinical trials are an important option of care for cancer patients since they often
         provide the most up-to-date and effective treatment for end-stage disease. It has
         also been suggested that more participation in oncology clinical trials could lead
         to improved survival in cancer patients 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>. Nevertheless, patient enrollment remains particularly low in oncology clinical trials
         (according to the National Cancer Institute, less than 5% of adults with incident
         cancer participate in clinical trials in the United States) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Barriers to recruitment for oncology clinical trials can be summarized into three
         main categories 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>:
      </p>
      <p> Individual barriers (such as patients feeling uncomfortable with experimentation
         or experiencing a loss of control over decision-making, and physician time and effort
         required for recruitment),
      </p>
      <p> Barriers related to RCT designs (overly strict or non-adapted criteria, too large
         a number of RCTs, RCT complexity leading to difficulties in explaining trials to patients,
         and so forth), and
      </p>
      <p> Barriers caused by system and organizational features (lack of staff and research
         nurses, communication difficulties, planning of local resources according to RCT designs,
         and so forth).
      </p>
      <p>Different strategies, often timesaving and cost-effective, can be used to overcome
         these barriers (for example, hiring a research nurse or a data manager). But there
         is also evidence that Health Information Systems and Information Technologies can
         improve the recruitment process. A review of recent literature shows that many studies
         examine, discuss, and/or deal with support systems for clinical trial recruitment
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">5</span>
         </span>. These are mainly concerned with addressing individual barriers, and sometimes with
         the development of tools to ease usability of eligibility criteria. However, the authors
         highlight the lack of evaluation and workflow integration of the support systems into
         the RCT recruitment process, and they emphasize the importance of the pre-screening
         phase for recruitment, particularly for RCT recruitment systems.
      </p>
      <p>In this study, we hypothesized that the improvement of pre-screening of patients eligible
         for RCTs would lead to an improvement in overall patient enrollment in clinical trials.
         Thus, the study focused on the pre-screening steps of patient enrollment to RCTs.
      </p>
      <p>The main objective of the present study was to assess the impact of semi-automated
         decision support systems in improving patient pre-screening in oncology RCTs. Therefore,
         the study compared the pre-screening decisions made prospectively by the physicians
         during patient care, with the pre-screening decisions made with a systematic and retrospective
         review of the medical reports. Then, the study identified factors that could make
         pre-screening more efficient.

                  </b> Step one: MDC meeting request by a treating physician concerning a patient; step
                  two: MDC meeting scheduled by the MDC secretary; step three: presentation of the MDC
                  report during the MDC meeting; step four: registration of the therapeutic decision
                  in the oncologic electronic health records (EHR) and feedback to the treating physician.

            <div tagx="graphic"></div>
         </div>
         <p>In Brittany (France), the workflow starts with a request made by the treating physician
            to the MDC secretary, in order to schedule the presentation of the patient’s case
            within the MDM (steps one and two). With the patient data provided by the treating
            physician (most of the time from the paper-based patient record), the secretary fills
            in an online standard MDC report designed for each type of cancer. The MDC report
            is intended to collect all essential patient data to make the decision during the
            MDM.
         </p>
         <p>On the day of the MDM, the secretary shows each MDC report to the tumor board (step
            three). After the discussion, the therapeutic decision is registered (step four) and
            sent back to the treating physician who can then inform the patient.
         </p>
         <p>During the MDM, some patients may be proposed (in a pre-screening phase) as being
            potentially eligible for an RCT; according to a subset of selection criteria called
            that we will call ‘pre-screening criteria’. These criteria correspond to those that
            can be checked from the retrospective data available in the patient charts. Pre-screening
            criteria include, for instance, demographic characteristics (such as age and gender)
            and some medical characteristics (such as tumor stage and surgical history). The other
            criteria (which we will call ‘screening criteria’) are those that can only be tested
            secondarily (in a screening phase), after having contacted the patient (for example,
            a negative HIV test on the day of enrollment). The patients are eventually included
            in the appropriate RCT when all eligibility criteria are met.
         </p>
         <p>The present study proposes to retrospectively analyze the decision-making process
            of the MDM and to compare it to a systematic review of the patient’s case.

         </div>
         <p>Urologic oncology was chosen as the experimental field for practical reasons, partly
            because most eligibility criteria are readily handled by computerized data (Tumor,
            lymph node and metastasis classification of malignant tumors (TNM) staging, the Gleason
            score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, and so forth). The study focused on
            prostate cancer, which is the most common form in urology. It is also the main topic
            of discussion at urology MDMs and of many clinical trials.
         </p>
         <p>Four prostate cancer clinical trials were active and recruiting patients at the Cancer
            Research Institute of Rennes during the study period (between October 2008 and March
            2009), all conducted by the French Genitourinary Tumor Group (GETUG)

         </div>
         <p>The data used in our study consisted of the information contained in the MDC reports,
            and of the corresponding therapeutic decisions taken during the MDMs. The MDC reports
            included general characteristics of patients, medical history, and data related to
            prostate cancer, such as the Gleason score, tumor staging (clinical and pathological
            TNM classification), and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. According to each
            case, the MDC team’s decisions were either to propose a standard therapy to the patient,
            or to participate in a clinical trial (in this case, the MDC team had estimated that
            pre-screening criteria seemed to be verified). MDC reports and MDM decisions were
            retrospectively and exhaustively collected. The data extraction (Figures 
            <div tagx="figr">1</div> and 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div>) corresponded to a period of six months while patient recruitment for the four prostate
            cancer RCTs was occurring.

            <h3>Evaluation and statistical analysis</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The evaluation protocol consisted in collecting and comparing three types of decision
            (MDC, clinical research assistant (CRA), and principal investigator (PI)). The MDC
            team’s decision was the initial tumor board’s decision made directly during the MDM.
         </p>
         <p>The CRA’s decision (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div>, step three) was obtained by asking a CRA experienced in recruitment to clinical
            trials to systematically review all the MDC reports (while ensuring to hide the MDC
            team’s decision). Thus, the CRA only had access to information explicitly contained
            in the MDC reports; the CRA did not have any knowledge or information about the patients
            other than MDC reports and was unaware of MDC decisions. The MDC decisions and CRA’s
            decisions were compared (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div>, step four). A PI reviewed the MDC reports corresponding to the discrepancies between
            the CRA’s decisions and MDM decisions (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div>, steps five and six). In our study, we considered the PI’s decision (Figure 
            <div tagx="figr">2</div>, step six) as being the best gold standard as the PI is the person the most involved
            in clinical trial recruitment.
         </p>
         <p>Results were described using means associated with standard deviations (
            <i>m ± ε</i>), and absolute and relative frequencies (n (%)). The MDC, CRA, and PI pre-screening
            decisions were described especially by the MDC, CRA and PI pre-screening rate, and
            compared using the McNemar’s chi-square test. Factors that could influence the MDC
            team’s pre-screening decisions (the characteristics of the MDMs and the content of
            the MDC reports) were tested using the Pearson’s correlation test and the Mann–Whitney
            U test.
         </p>
         <p>A descriptive analysis of the discrepancies between the MDC, CRA, and PI proposals
            was also performed. Statistical analysis was performed using R software, R Foundation

         <p>During the study period, 23 urologic MDMs were held at the Comprehensive Cancer Center
            of Rennes, and 466 MDC reports were analyzed. Among them, 286 MDC reports concerned
            patients with prostate cancer, all of which were evaluated in the present study.
         </p>
         <p>On average, 7 ± 1.7 physicians, including 3 ± 0.9 oncologists, attended each MDM.
            The PI of GETUG 14 was present at 12 of the 23 MDMs held during the study period,
            the PI of GETUG 15 at 15 of the 23 MDMs, the PI of GETUG 16 at 12 of the 23 MDMs,
            and the PI of GETUG 17 at 13 of the 23 MDMs.
         </p>
         <p>On average, during an MDM, 20 ± 6.2 reports were discussed with 12 ± 4.6 of those
            being related to patients with prostate cancer. Clinical and pathological TNM stages
            were found in 67 (23.4%) and 94 (32.9%) of the 286 MDC reports, respectively concerning
            patients with prostate cancer. However, 261 (91.3%) and 252 (88.1%) of the 286 MDC
            reports included the Gleason score and the PSA level, respectively.

         <p>A total of 26 patients were proposed for screening by the physicians who participated
            in the MDMs; 17 for screening in GETUG 14, seven for screening in GETUG 16 and two
            for screening in GETUG 17. No patient was proposed for screening in GETUG 15.

         <p>Among factors that may have influenced pre-screening during the MDMs (the MDC team’s
            decisions), a statistically significant and negative correlation was found between
            the number of MDC reports concerning patients with prostate cancer and the pre-screening
            rate of each MDM (Pearson correlation coefficient (r) = −0.42, 
            <i>P</i> = 0.046). There was also a reverse correlation between the overall number of MDC
            reports discussed in MDMs and the pre-screening rates of the MDMs, but this negative
            correlation was not found to be significant (r = −0.37, 
            <i>P</i> = 0.082). The number of physicians and the number of oncologists attending the MDMs
            did not significantly influence the pre-screening rates (
            <i>P</i> = 0.521 and 
            <i>P</i> = 0.964, respectively). Neither did the presence of the PI, whatever the RCT (GETUG

         <p>A total of 22 patients were found eligible for screening in an RCT based on at least
            two pre-screening methods; most pre-selections were for the same RCTs. Only one discrepancy
            was observed between decisions made at the MDM and the CRA (GETUG 17 versus GETUG
            16, respectively), but the PI retained neither.
         </p>
         <p>Discrepancies mainly concerned patients initially excluded during the MDC meetings
            (59 patients were proposed by the CRA and 14 were finally validated by the PI). Regarding
            patients initially proposed for an RCT during the MDC meetings, two patients were
            secondarily excluded by the CRA and, finally, the PI definitively excluded four patients.
            There was no patient who was not proposed by the CRA but was proposed either during
            an MDM or by the PI. Nevertheless, the PI proposed one patient who was not proposed
            either by the CRA or at the MDC meetings. Figure

         <p>The four MDC team’s pre-selections excluded by the PI were due to mistakes on the
            evaluation of some exclusion criteria during the MDMs (too high a PSA rate or the
            presence of a positive margin after surgery). Among the CRA's 47 pre-selections that
            were not retained by the PI, 35 were due to implicit information known only by the
            clinicians and not explicitly available in the MDC reports. For example, the PI excluded
            18 CRA proposals because the patients had a Gleason score of less than seven, but
            such a criterion was not described in the exclusion or inclusion criteria of the RCTs.
            In the same way, six patients could have been eligible for an RCT but the MDC teams
            judged another type of care more effective. Further, nine patients were excluded because
            they had some specific characteristics (vital status, combination of comorbidities,
            and wishes) not compatible with enrollment in the RCTs according to the MDC teams.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In this study, the pre-screening rate with MDC team’s decisions made during the MDMs
         was estimated to be at 9.1%. It is higher than rates previously reported in other
         studies (around 5% for oncology RCTs) 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>. Nevertheless, the best pre-screening rate was estimated to be 12.9% (based on the
         PI’s decisions). This confirms that patient pre-screening in clinical cancer research
         could be improved by a systematic review of the MDC reports after MDMs.
      </p>
      <p>It has been shown that individual barriers, such as the time and effort required for
         patient recruitment for the physicians, are factors that decrease enrollment in RCTs
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. The present study found that all patients proposed by the PIs were also proposed
         by the CRA’s systematic review, except one. In other words, the CRA’s review resulted
         in the justified rejection of more than 200 of the 286 initial MDC reports. Thus,
         we argue that the addition of a manual (or a computerized) systematic review at the
         first step of the screening process (the pre-screening phase) could lead to substantial
         gains in time and effort for the physicians’ screening task afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the results showed that the pre-screening decision should not be based
         only on the information available in the MDC reports, since some data are missing
         (such as TNM staging), or are not explicit. These issues illustrate why the pre-screening
         rate (29.0%) is so high when the CRA makes the decision alone; because their decision
         relies only on the content of the MDC reports. Missing data cannot be used to exclude
         the patients who are then selected as being eligible for RCTs. From the perspective
         of automating this decision-making process using a recruitment support system, we
         can foresee that such a system will overestimate the number of patients potentially
         eligible for RCTs, just as the CRA has done.
      </p>
      <p>It is likely that the best approach for these systems is not intended to replace the
         physicians’ decision, but to help physicians by reminding them that every patient
         is potentially eligible for an available clinical trial. The main objective will therefore
         be more to avoid missing out on patients who could be included than deciding which
         patients should be included.
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, our result showed that clinical TNM staging and pathological TNM staging are
         missing in 68% and 76%, respectively, of the MDC reports proposed by pre-screening
         after correction by the PI (data not shown). From a decision-making perspective, missing
         and implicit data (only known by the physicians of the MDC teams) could be seen as
         problematic regarding patient selection, but our results showed that missing and implicit
         information usually led to the exclusion of patients. Thus, these results showed that
         missing and implicit data mainly caused an overestimation of patients eligible for
         RCTs, resulting in the decreased precision of the systematic (or automated) pre-screening,
         but this did not lead to the wrongful exclusion of eligible patients.
      </p>
      <p>It could be argued that observations in the present study reflect local patterns of
         pre-screening practice and medical record design. Indeed, centers with routine systematic
         pathology reporting, in line with international standards, could certainly have a
         better registration rate of clinical and pathological TNM staging and thus increase
         the performance, and above all precision, of systematic (or automated) pre-screening.
      </p>
      <p>This illustrates that the best pre-screening practices cannot be guaranteed without
         providing the essential information (such as TNM staging) at the time of pre-screening,
         but they are not limited due to the systematic (or automated) pre-screening methods
         themselves. The present study shows that despite the presence of numerous missing
         data concerning key elements for enrollment in RCTs in urologic oncology, the implementation
         of a manual (or a computerized) systematic review could optimize the pre-screening
         task by improving the pre-screening rate and by reducing the time and effort required
         for pre-screening by physicians.
      </p>
      <p>We did not succeed in discovering which factors could really impact the pre-screening
         rate, except for the number of MDC reports discussed per session. The low number of
         patients who are actually eligible in the present study could be a limit to the interpretation
         of such a result, but it confirmed at least that the workload during the MDC meetings
         is a major factor that decreases pre-screening performance and enrollment in RCTs
         in oncology. Therefore, this is a strong argument for research as investigated in
         the automatic selection of clinical trials based on eligibility criteria (ASTEC) project
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>, which aims to provide tools to physicians (oncologists) to make the recruitment
         of patients for RCTs easier and more automatic.

         <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The study found that a systematic review of medical reports could increase the cumulative
         pre-screening rates of four RCTs recruiting patients at the Comprehensive Cancer Center
         in Rennes from 9 to 13%. Also, we argue that such an additional systematic review
         during the first step of the screening process could lead to substantial gains in
         time and effort for physicians in their task of recruiting patients for RCTs.
      </p>
      <p>The study also showed that missing data in the MDC reports leads to a systematic review
         that over-includes non-eligible patients, but does not over-exclude eligible patients.
         Therefore, we confirm the potential gain in using the semi-automated selection of
         electronic MDC reports to avoid missing out on patients eligible for RCTs.
      </p>
      <p>To conclude, optimizing the pre-screening process represents an interesting way to
         improve patient enrollment in clinical trials, which remains particularly low in oncology
         research. The use of computerized pre-screening support systems to perform a systematic
         review of eligible patients could help to reach such an objective.
