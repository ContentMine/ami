                  <h3>Background</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Medications are an effective intervention for managing and preventing health problems
                  but their benefit can be undermined by non-adherence or adverse drug events (ADEs).
                  Since these issues may be interconnected, efforts to improve non-adherence should
                  also include reduction of ADEs. We have developed the ISTOP-ADE system (Information
                  Systems-enabled Outreach for Preventing Adverse Drug Events), which enables timely
                  monitoring and managing of ADEs. The objectives of this study are to determine whether
                  the ISTOP-ADE system, compared to routine care, will reduce: a) the probability of
                  discontinuing the use of prognosis-altering medications; b) the probability of a patient
                  experiencing a severe ADE; c) the proportion of patients experiencing ADEs, preventable
                  ADEs and ameliorable ADEs; and d) health services utilization.

                  <h3>Methods/design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>We will randomly assign 2,200 adult ambulatory patients in the province of Québec
                  who have been prescribed an incident medication for the management or prevention of
                  a chronic health condition, to routine care or the ISTOP-ADE system. The ISTOP-ADE
                  system consists of an interactive voice response system (IVRS) paired with pharmacist
                  support. The IVRS will call patients at 3 and 17 days post-prescription to determine
                  if they are experiencing any problems and connect them with a pharmacist when required
                  or desired by the patient. We will evaluate medication persistence at 180 days and
                  health-care utilization using provincial administrative data. Two blinded physicians
                  will ascertain ADE status through a case review.

                  <h3>Discussion</h3>
               </div>
               <p>We expect the ISTOP-ADE intervention to be feasible and to improve the quality of
                  patient care through improved medication adherence, reduced ADE duration and reduced
                  number of ADEs resulting in an emergency department or inpatient encounter. This in
                  turn could lower health-care utilization, saving costs and lowering the burden on
                  emergency departments and family practices. The success of ISTOP-ADE would present
                  opportunities to implement this intervention through health systems, health insurance
                  agents and commercial pharmacies.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Medications are an effective intervention for managing and preventing many acute and
         chronic health-care problems. Their benefit is commonly reduced by non-adherence,
         in which patients either do not take or stop taking the medication as prescribed,
         or by adverse drug events (ADEs), in which patients experience side effects of the
         medications. These issues are interrelated. Some patients do not take their medication
         due to their fear of an impending ADE, while others stop taking the medication because
         of an ADE. Therefore, efforts to increase adherence should include efforts to target
         ADE reduction specifically.
      </p>
      <p>To address these concerns, we have developed the Information Systems-enabled Outreach
         for Preventing ADEs (ISTOP-ADE) system (protocol version 1, 1 March 2012). The ISTOP-ADE
         system consists of a set of business processes supported by a technology infrastructure.
         The information technology is designed to connect providers to patients and includes
         an electronic health record system, a clinical data repository and an interactive
         voice response system (IVRS). This system enables timely monitoring of patients for
         ADEs and couples it with an effective arm to manage ADEs if, and when, they occur.
      </p>
      <p>We recently established the feasibility and acceptability of the ISTOP-ADE system
         in a prospective cohort study. The pilot study included 628 patients who were prescribed
         an incident prescription. The ISTOP-ADE system successfully contacted 90% of patients.
         Important measures of the system’s effectiveness included the identification of 45%
         of ADEs, 50% of all potential ADEs and 30% of primary non-adherence episodes. In terms
         of potential benefits, it positively influenced the management of 42% of all medication-related
         problems. In terms of acceptability, almost all patients found it easy to use and
         understand and reported they would use the system again if it was provided to them.
         Physicians and pharmacists also supported the system

            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. While these results are favorable, a controlled clinical trial in which patients
         are randomly assigned to the ISTOP-ADE system or routine care is required to determine
         the system’s effectiveness. We therefore designed this study.

         </div>
         <p>This research will occur during ambulatory care in the province of Québec, Canada.
            We will study prescriptions in patients receiving primary care from a selected group
            of physicians using the Medical Office of the 21st Century (MOXXI) electronic health
            record system. MOXXI was developed by the McGill University’s Clinical and Health
            Informatics Research Group. It is currently used by over 100 primary care physicians
            in Montréal and Québec City. The MOXXI system is linked to the provincial insurance
            company, Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ), resulting in an electronic
            medical record that displays a drug profile of prescribed as well as dispensed drugs,
            emergency department visits and hospitalizations in the past 12 months, a list of
            active and past health problems, and an electronic prescribing tool. Data stored by
            MOXXI have been used by the McGill research team for medical research in the past

         <p>When a physician uses MOXXI to prescribe a new medication for a patient, a pop-up
            window will appear on their computer screen to indicate the patient’s eligibility.
            This pop-up window will prompt the doctor to inform the patient of the study, confirm
            their eligibility and seek consent. We will obtain informed consent from each participant.
            If the patient consents, the physician will confirm the patient’s phone number, preferred
            language and preferred time of day to be called. If the physician deems the patient
            ineligible or the patient does not consent, then the reason will be captured in MOXXI
            using a standard classification.

            <h3>Intervention</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The intervention consists of an IVRS call coupled with pharmacist support. We will
            program the IVRS to call patients automatically on day 3 and day 17 following their
            prescription. If a call is not answered, the system will make as many as eight separate
            attempts (two per day over a maximum of 4 days) before marking the call as unsuccessful.
            If a call is answered, the IVRS will proceed through a calling algorithm. The following
            questions will be asked at each call:
         </p>
         <p>1. Since receiving your medication, have you started taking it?</p>
         <p>2. Since receiving your medication, have you had any problems?</p>
         <p>3. Since receiving your medication, have you developed any new symptoms?</p>
         <p>4. Would you like to speak to a pharmacist?</p>
         <p>If the patient answers ‘No’ to the first question or ‘Yes’ to any of the three remaining
            questions, the IVRS will inform the patient that a pharmacist will personally contact
            them within 2 business days. The IVRS will send an email to a pharmacist informing
            them of the patient’s request. In addition, the IVRS will be capable of receiving
            inbound calls from patients regarding their medications at any time. This will also
            connect the patient to the pharmacist according to the same business rules as for
            the outbound IVRS calls.
         </p>
         <p>When required, the pharmacist will contact the patient. Prior to contact, the pharmacist
            will access the electronic health record to obtain background information on the patient’s
            health status and medication use. During the call, the pharmacist will document the
            patient’s problems as well as their recommendation for resolving the problem in the
            electronic health record. If the pharmacist deems the patient’s problems are significant,
            then the pharmacist can escalate the issue to the patient’s primary care physician
            using the electronic health record.

               </span>. Specifically, a clinician will create a case summary describing the post-prescription
               course for each patient experiencing a problem. Problems will be identified during
               the 21-day interview. The clinician will compile information derived from the post-intervention
               interview and a review of the patient’s MOXXI record using a standardized format.
               The summary will elaborate on the patient’s underlying health conditions, the medications
               currently being used (including the index prescription), the timing of the problem,
               the management of the problem, the timing of the resolution and what the patient was
               told about the cause of the problem.
            </p>
            <p>To define ADE status, two physicians (blinded to allocation group) will review each
               case summary and determine whether the case represents an ADE. This determination
               is made using a six-point classification system with a cut-point of 3. A case is considered
               to be an ADE if both reviewers agree that the case was an undesirable outcome and

            for the composite outcome (1,059 patients in each arm). To be more conservative, we

         <p>Data will be exported from the MOXXI system and analyzed using SAS software (Cary,
            NC, USA). All data analysis will be performed in secure physical locations using hardware
            that is password protected. Only study personnel will have access to the data. Simple
            descriptive statistics to describe the patient population, call statistics and outcome
            measures will be used. Continuous variables will be described using median and inter-quartile
            ranges, while categorical variables will be described using frequency distributions.
            The statistical significance of any associations between group assignment and measures
            will be assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and or the chi-square test, respectively,
            for continuous and categorical variables. Since the primary outcome is binary, tests
            to compare outcomes between the intervention and control groups will be simple chi-square
            statistics. An alpha of 0.05 as a threshold to determine statistical significance
            using a two-tailed distribution will be applied.
         </p>
         <p>As a sensitivity analysis, logistic regression modeling will be used to assess possible
            baseline factors that are associated with the outcome and differ between the intervention
            and control groups. Analogous analyses to assess significance for the individual components
            of the composite primary outcome and the binary secondary outcome variables will also
            be performed (ADE occurrence, preventable ADE occurrence and ameliorable ADE occurrence).
         </p>
         <p>To compare health services utilization, since the outcomes are event data, which follow
            a Poisson distribution, incidence rates for the outcome will be calculated. Incidence
            rates will be calculated using PROC GENMOD to create a 
            <i>t</i>-test. Multivariable Poisson regression will be used to compare the rates, while adjusting
            for baseline factors. The model will use the treatment group as an independent covariate.
            If over-dispersion is noted, a negative binomial model will be used.

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>We have planned this randomized trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
         of an automated outreach program to monitor patients receiving a new ambulatory care
         prescription. It is an important study as the intervention has shown promising results
         in a pilot study. Some health payers and pharmacies may feel that this intervention
         is already warranted on face value and based on our preliminary findings. We have
         advised against this approach as the system has not been compared against routine
         care. In a situation where there are limited resources, it is not appropriate to invest
         in interventions of unknown effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>We chose adherence with prognosis-altering medications as our primary outcome. This
         outcome is important as many studies have demonstrated poor adherence – approximately
         50% of patients with chronic illness do not take their medication as prescribed –
         and this in turn has been estimated to have major impacts on disease progression and
         health-care costs 
         				
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>. We will assess this outcome using administrative data. This ascertainment method
         has been demonstrated to be accurate and will not be biased by an inability to blind
         patients to the intervention. Our secondary outcomes are similarly important. In particular,
         ADEs are common following incident prescriptions 
         				
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>. While many of the symptoms related to ADEs are short in duration, a substantial
         proportion of patients have symptoms lasting longer than 7 days and can lead patients
         to discontinue their medications on their own. Collectively, these outcomes will allow
         us to assess adequately the value of our intervention to patients and the health-care
         system.
      </p>
      <p>Our study will also give us an opportunity to assess further implementation issues.
         We will track the costs of the intervention closely, including the workload required
         by our pharmacist to follow up the automated calls and by the physicians, who may
         need to do extra work to respond to patient complaints. We will also assess the failed
         automated calls to assess which patients do not accept this type of intervention.
         Finally, we will conduct an assessment of patient factors associated with adherence.
         All of this information will guide decisions pertaining to whether and how this system
         should be implemented, and to whom it should be directed.
      </p>
      <p>This is an ambitious study, which will run in over 100 primary care practices in two
         large urban settings. It will take 3 years to complete the recruitment and follow-up.
         We are randomizing patients at the patient rather than provider level because there
         is little risk of contamination or co-intervention. The patients are unlikely to interact
         with each other, and, based on our pilot study, there was very little interaction
         between patients and doctors within the 3 weeks of their prescription. There are some
         sources of bias in our design to be considered. The primary risk is the lack of blinding
         in patients and primary care doctors. This is a concern as knowledge of allocation
         could change behavior. However, based on findings from our pilot study, we predict
         this is unlikely. In addition, outcome assessment is done objectively or by blinded
         reviewers. In short, this study will have internal validity and will be generalizable.
      </p>
      <p>In summary, we have previously developed an automated outreach program for patients
         prescribed new medications. We have tested this intervention in a pilot study. This
         work found the intervention to be feasible and suggested it might improve the quality
         of patient care through reduced ADE duration and improved medication adherence. We
         have designed this randomized trial to test whether the intervention is effective
         compared to routine care. If the ISTOP-ADE system were demonstrated to be effective,
         then there would be significant opportunities to implement this intervention through
         health systems, health insurance agents and commercial pharmacies.
