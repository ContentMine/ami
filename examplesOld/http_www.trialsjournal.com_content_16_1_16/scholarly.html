               <p>To investigate the nature of the research process as a whole, factors that might influence

               <p>Semi-structured qualitative telephone interviews with authors of trials, identified
                  from two sources: trials published since 2002 included in Cochrane systematic reviews
                  selected for the ORBIT project; and trial reports randomly sampled from 14,758 indexed
                  on PubMed over the 12-month period from August 2007 to July 2008.

                  <h3>Results</h3>
               </div>
               <p>A total of 268 trials were identified for inclusion, 183 published since 2002 and
                  included in the Cochrane systematic reviews selected for the ORBIT project and 85
                  randomly selected published trials indexed on PubMed. The response rate from researchers
                  in the former group was 21% (38/183) and in the latter group was 25% (21/85). Overall,
                  59 trialists were interviewed from the two different sources. A number of major but
                  related themes emerged regarding the conduct and reporting of trials: establishment
                  of the research question; identification of outcome variables; use of and adherence
                  to the study protocol; conduct of the research; reporting and publishing of findings.
                  Our results reveal that, although a substantial proportion of trialists identify outcome
                  variables based on their clinical experience and knowing experts in the field, there
                  can be insufficient reference to previous research in the planning of a new trial.
                  We have revealed problems with trial recruitment: not reaching the target sample size,
                  over-estimation of recruitment potential and recruiting clinicians not being in equipoise.
                  We found a wide variation in the completeness of protocols, in terms of detailing
                  study rationale, outlining the proposed methods, trial organisation and ethical considerations.

                  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
               </div>
               <p>Our results confirm that the conduct and reporting of some trials can be inadequate.
                  Interviews with researchers identified aspects of clinical research that can be especially
                  challenging: establishing appropriate and relevant outcome variables to measure, use
                  of and adherence to the study protocol, recruiting of study participants and reporting
                  and publishing the study findings. Our trialists considered the prestige and impact
                  factors of academic journals to be the most important criteria for selecting those
                  to which they would submit manuscripts.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>That clinical research is important for the continued development of healthcare provision
         and the wellbeing of society is undisputed. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are
         considered the highest level of evidence on which to base healthcare decisions about
         healthcare interventions, making it essential that trials are performed and reported
         to the highest standards. Researchers have a responsibility to conduct the best research
         they can and publish accurate and unbiased results from it 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. However, there is a large and growing body of evidence, across many specialties
         of healthcare, that the current conduct and reporting of RCTs is inadequate 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Problems associated with the conduct of research have been linked to the lack of a
         structured, practical and businesslike approach 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>. Problems include: trials failing to recruit the pre-specified number of participants
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">8</span>
         </span>, trials taking longer than expected to be completed 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>, and problems associated with the collection of outcome data 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Another element of trial conduct that can be problematic relates to dissemination
         and reporting of findings. Underreporting or selective reporting of findings has been
         described as scientific misconduct 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. Empirical research consistently suggests that findings from published research are
         more likely to be statistically significant than those from research that remains
         unpublished 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">12</span>
         </span>. Not reporting whole studies based on the strength and direction of the trial results
         has been termed ‘publication bias’ 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>. Reporting bias can also occur within an individual study. For example, it may be
         that several outcomes are measured but only a selected subset of them are reported
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Published research articles generally provide an overview of the research questions,
         the methods used to determine their answers and the study results. Such articles rarely
         reveal the practical challenges encountered by researchers as the research progressed
         and how these challenges were managed. Thus, what is missing from the currently available
         literature is any account of the reality of undertaking research with all its challenges.
         Yet, it is important to know more about how trialists understand and carry out research
         and to explore how this might affect both research progress and reporting of findings.
         Moreover, there is a growing recognition that building a robust evidence base relies
         on trials being conducted to the highest standards, and it is widely accepted that
         those high standards cannot be assumed but have to be demonstrated by full and honest
         reporting of trials 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">15</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Qualitative research methods are ideal for studies that aim to explore previously
         unresearched topics and to identify perceptions and uncover meanings. At the time
         of designing this study, we scrutinised relevant databases and contacted key researchers
         but were unable to find any qualitative research that assessed the research process
         from the viewpoint or situation of the researcher. We therefore decided to investigate
         qualitatively the nature of the research process as a whole and factors that might
         influence the way in which research is carried out and researchers ultimately report
         their findings.
      </p>
      <p>The study we report here was part of a larger study investigating outcome reporting
         bias in clinical trials, the ORBIT project 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>. Our focus here was on trialists’ real life experiences of carrying out and publishing
         findings from clinical trials across a range of clinical areas. The broad aim of ORBIT
         was to estimate quantitatively the prevalence and impact of outcome reporting bias
         in clinical trials. A nine point classification system for missing outcome data in
         RCTs was developed and applied to the trials assessed in a large, unselected cohort
         of Cochrane systematic reviews. Trialists were contacted and the reason sought for
         the non-reporting of data. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the impact
         of outcome reporting bias on reviews that included a single meta-analysis of the review
         primary outcome. Outcome reporting bias was suspected in at least one RCT in more
         than a third of the Cochrane systematic reviews examined 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>The qualitative sub-study which is the focus of this paper was performed in two distinct
         parts. First, we compared original trial protocols with their linked subsequent publication(s)
         to identify the frequency of and reasons for selective outcome reporting and, for
         each trial where selective outcome reporting was identified, an 
         <i>aide memoire</i> was produced, detailing both the pre-specified outcomes and the published outcomes
         as the focus for further discussion with the trialists concerned during semi-structured
         telephone interviews. The findings from this comparison have been reported elsewhere
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>. Second, trialists’ experiences of carrying out and reporting of research more generally
         were also explored through the interviews; it is this latter element of the sub-study
         which is reported here.

         <h2>Methods</h2>
      </div>
      <p>We interviewed chief or lead investigators or co-authors of trials identified from
         two sources: trials published since 2002 covered in Cochrane systematic reviews selected
         for the ORBIT project 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">16</span>
         </span>; and trial reports randomly sampled from 14,758 indexed on PubMed over the 12-month
         period from August 2007 to July 2008. Each interview was tape-recorded with the trialist’s
         permission, transcribed and anonymised. All interviews were conducted in English by
         one of the investigators (RMDS). Study methods used are described in more detail elsewhere
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
         </span>. The project was not required to be reviewed under the terms of the Governance Arrangements
         for Research Ethics Committees in the UK as it was considered the project came under
         the remit of audit/service development.

            <h3>Interview schedule</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The focus of the interview schedule was on factors influencing the way research is
            carried out and how researchers report their findings. The schedule was organised
            sequentially, following the ‘natural history’ of a trial, and therefore had a pre-defined
            structure. The interview opened with questions about the main purpose of the trial
            in question, how the trial outcome variables were identified, and the use of and degree
            of the general adherence to the trial protocol. This was followed by questions relating
            to how the trial progressed and any associated challenges. Trialists were also asked
            to describe the process of writing up the findings and trying to get them published
            (including when papers were initially rejected). Additional information obtained at
            the time of the interview provided a descriptive summary of the characteristics of
            the trialist sample; for example, their previous research experience, the number of
            research sites involved in the trial under scrutiny, source of funding, level of statistical
            input to the trial design and analysis, and the planned and actual sample size. The
            interview schedule is as follows:
         </p>
         <p>1. General discussion about the trial as a whole - time taken to complete the trial,
            role of team members, funding, objective/motivation for doing the trial, clinical
            context at the time relating to intervention
         </p>
         <p>2. Regarding pre-specified outcomes - choice of pre-specified outcomes, pre-specify
            1°/2°
         </p>
         <p>3. Questions relating to reporting of outcomes (reported elsewhere)</p>
         <p>4. Key questions relating to missing/partial reporting of outcomes (reported elsewhere)</p>
         <p>5. Questions relating to the writing/getting paper published - roles of authors, statistician
            involvement, decisions made regarding publishing, decisions regarding choice of journal,
            journal decision, peer review
         </p>
         <p>6. Role of the protocol - writing of the protocol, journal asked to see trial protocol,
            protocol used during trial/writing up period

            <h3>Analysis</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Interviews were taped and transcribed, and qualitative analysis of transcripts was
            conducted 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
            </span>. The total number of interviews undertaken was governed by pragmatic reasons (that
            is, the number of trialists approached and agreeing to be interviewed), rather than
            theoretical considerations (that is, attainment of data saturation). The interview
            transcripts were compared and contrasted in order to elicit information regarding
            the individual trialists’ experiences, attitudes, perspectives, and opinions about
            the broad areas of trial design, conduct and reporting highlighted in the previous
            section. The analysis was led by RMDS but, to reduce possible interpreter bias and
            assess the plausibility and trustworthiness of the interpretation of the data, interviews
            were independently analysed early on by another member of the study team (AJ).The
            duplicate assessments were compared by going back to the original statements in the
            transcripts made by the trialists to validate both sets of interpretation. Two trialists
            requested, and were provided with, their interview transcript in order to add or clarify
            issues, and to ensure validity of the account produced. Each interview was given a
            unique identifier.

         </div>
         <p>A total of 268 trials were identified for possible inclusion in the qualitative sub-study:
            183 published since 2002 and covered in the Cochrane systematic reviews selected for
            the ORBIT project and 85 randomly selected published trials indexed on PubMed. The
            response rate from researchers in the former group was 21% (38/183) and in the latter
            group was 25% (21/85). Overall, 59 trialists were interviewed from the two different

            <h3>Characteristics of trialists interviewed</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Most interviews (48/59, 81%) were conducted with the trial chief investigator, eight
            of whom were also PhD students. A further eight interviews were conducted with the
            lead author and three with a co-author. Trialists were invited from 7 high-income
            countries (Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, UK and USA).
            All trials were performed after 1993. Trialists varied in their level of research
            experience; 32 (54%) had extensive experience and had been recruiting to trials for
            many years and had run their own trials. In contrast, six (10%) had no research experience.
            Just over a quarter (28%) said that no one with statistical expertise had been involved
            in the trial. Few trials (8%) recruited over 1,000 participants, most recruiting fewer
            than 100 participants (47%). Funding was provided by non-commercial sources for the
            majority of trials (56%).
         </p>
         <p>Forty-three trialists provided the full study protocol for comparison with subsequent
            publication(s) by the ORBIT sub-study team. Despite the fact that many trialists highlighted
            the need for a formal, agreed, comprehensive protocol, there was wide variation in
            the quality of the protocols in terms of detailing the study rationale, proposed methods,
            organisation, and ethical considerations, and all lacked some key information such
            as a clear definition of the primary outcome or a description of the statistical methods
            planned for the analysis. There was no complete protocol available for the remaining
            16 trials: six provided the ethics committee application, two the funding application,
            one a summary taken from the full protocol, and three extracts from relevant chapters
            of their doctoral theses. For one trial the protocol sent was simply a letter outlining
            a description of the trial sent to the funders. For two trials the full protocol was
            available, but not in English, and so an English summary was provided. For the remaining
            trial we obtained an abridged version of the protocol from the clinical trials.gov
            website 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">17</span>
            </span>.
         </p>
         <p>Characteristics of the publication(s) were compared between trialists agreeing (n = 59)
            and those not agreeing (n = 209) to be interviewed. A higher proportion of trialists
            who did not agree to be interviewed were funded by industry (82% vs 18%). There was
            no evidence of association between a trialist agreeing to be interviewed and the sample
            size of the trial.
         </p>
         <p>The median publication year was 2005 (range 2002 to 2008). In all but one case interviews
            were performed with one trial investigator from each trial; for one trial we interviewed
            the chief investigator, the lead author and statistician simultaneously at their request.
            Interviews lasted on average 56 minutes (range 19 to 96 minutes).

            <h3>Major responses around the natural history</h3>
         </div>
         <p>A number of major but related responses were identified regarding the conduct and
            reporting of trials. In presenting these we have ordered the data to reflect the natural
            history of conducting a clinical trial, namely:

      <div id="">
         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Framing of the research question</h3>
         </div>
         <p>All trials were conducted as a result of identification of a clinical need or where
            clinicians were in clinical equipoise. Some of the trialists were experienced researchers
            and had themselves performed previous empirical research, as a consequence their research
            questions were “in part generated through our earlier work”.
         </p>
         <p>Others, however, identified voids in the published research literature where little
            or no actual research had been performed. As a consequence, this gave the trialists
            the basis on which to formulate their research questions:
            
         </p>
         <p>“There were virtually no control studies of the intervention, so it seemed to be a
            wide open area where there is a great need to pursue intervention” (31).
         </p>
         <p>“So I discussed it with colleagues that you know I wonder if this isn’t something
            that should be tested. We looked at the research and we couldn’t find anything published
            that actually did a test” (6).
         </p>
         <p>One trialist used the term equipoise spontaneously, talking about it at an individual
            level and the wider community level: “We had equipoise on this subject, and we felt
            that other people did not have equipoise. So there was an international move to change
            policy, and introduce an intervention that we felt had not been tested and evaluated
            adequately” (27).
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="">
         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Defining key outcomes</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The responses from the trialists clearly showed that pre-specified outcome variables
            were generally identified from either clinical practice or expert opinion:
            
         </p>
         <p>“It is a very clinical question and they are experienced clinicians who know what’s
            important in the clinic” (7).
         </p>
         <p>“Well we looked at the literature and we also spoke directly to [name] - he has done
            more trials with the population than anyone else, and so he and our colleagues met
            with him and got his advice about what should be measured” (37).
         </p>
         <p>We asked trialists if there was a formal consensus process in their clinical field
            for identifying outcomes. However, very few (n = 2) were able to base decisions about
            what constituted key outcomes, as for most they often did not exist. Others identified
            the role systematic reviews play:
            
         </p>
         <p>“I think one of the challenges with the protocol development is us defining what an
            appropriate outcome was, and I think at the time when this was written, I think that
            was about 2003, there was not yet a consensus based criteria. So at the time that
            was part of the challenge in figuring out what was a reasonable outcome that was feasible
            for the study that we were planning to conduct but actually had some validity” (56).
         </p>
         <p>“According to Cochrane analysis we must take into account not only [outcome] and problems
            of patients, but also quality of life and therefore we added quality of life in our
            measurements” (2).
         </p>
         <p>There was, though, evidence of some degree of guidance or informal consensus within
            individual specialties which was provided by two trialists:
            
         </p>
         <p>“Yes there are, there are recommendations or guidelines. And there is some latitude
            within those guidelines” (15).
         </p>
         <p>“So in the absence of a consensus statement [....] there probably is informal consensus”
            (53).
         </p>
         <p>In addition to lack of consensus about whether they were informative, relevant or
            important, one trialist recognised different factors were dominating the selection
            of outcome variables, for example ensuring the trial would be funded:
            
         </p>
         <p>“I think even when we were designing the protocol, there was less consensus over whether
            that was an important outcome. I think partly because if you had omitted that I think
            some reviewers might have said: ‘wow you are not measuring [outcome]’. That being
            said there is a vast amount of literature showing that it’s of completely no relevance,
            but it was a practical decision to make sure we got money. So I think we were pretty
            ambivalent about its inclusion, and certainly once we had analysed it we thought you
            know, it didn’t really add much to the information coming out from the paper, so we
            didn’t include it” (56).

      <div id="">
         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Role of the study protocol</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The role of the protocol was discussed in the interviews. Authors reported differences
            in application of, and adherence to, the protocol during the conduct of their trial.
            Some, unsurprisingly, used the protocol to ensure adherence to study procedures and
            to assist in writing the final publication. Conversely, in some cases it was apparent
            the protocol was not referred to once the trial was in progress:
            
         </p>
         <p>“Yes, the physicians that are participating in the trial, yes they, they do have the
            protocol and they are expected to follow the protocol clearly” (41);
         </p>
         <p>“You write the protocol you spend months doing it, and you have got a really good
            grasp of it and then as the trial progresses the protocol fades, and it’s not just
            in this trial, but in other trials” (59).
         </p>
         <p>Regarding journals requirement of submission of the trial protocol alongside the manuscript,
            three trialists had been asked to provide their trial protocol as part of the process.
            All journals had an impact factor of at least 30.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div id="">
         <div tagx="st">
            <h3>Problems with conduct of the research</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Where the trialists identified problems with trial conduct, these were mainly surrounding
            recruitment difficulties and the target sample size not being met. Thirteen trialists
            reported that recruitment was more difficult than expected, resulting in fewer participants
            being recruited, of which four acknowledged this in their reporting, reasons for which
            are unclear. Recruitment difficulties were variously explained by potential participants’
            lack of motivation to join the trial and over-estimation of recruitment potential:
            
         </p>
         <p>“We actually got a very high take-up rate, but treatment as usual made the trial a
            bit unpopular with some people, I think we had 60 odd who refused. They didn’t want
            to be in a trial where there was a 1 in 3 chance of getting treatment as usual” (20).
         </p>
         <p>“We had some difficulty with enrolment, I think because there were less patients available
            than we had envisaged at the beginning” (35).
         </p>
         <p>The interviews also highlighted instances where recruitment problems led to early
            trial closure or prompted changes in the research design:
            
         </p>
         <p>“We were running out of money and the recruitment was still quite slow, so we looked
            at the collection of subjects and we found no difference, it just didn’t seem worth
            going on. Also, the analysis was driven by an opportunity to present the data at a
            conference and so we analysed what we had at that point, it didn’t seem worth continuing”
            (5).
         </p>
         <p>“We changed the follow up interval [from 24 months to 20 months] because it took us
            longer to do recruitment than we thought it would. Also we wanted to finish the study
            in the time line we had funding for and decided that probably those four months weren’t
            going to make a whole heck of difference, so we compressed the timeline” (4).
         </p>
         <p>Trialists also highlighted problems among trial recruiters themselves. Although equipoise
            was generally not expressed overtly, it appeared that clinicians were always not uncertain
            about the treatment effects; and it was apparent that some were unable to recruit
            participants effectively in situations where they had some doubts:
            
         </p>
         <p>“It was more difficult to recruit than we had imagined. We realised that the nurses
            were recruiting in a very sort of naive way – in that they were selecting women for
            the trial who they thought the trial would work for. So they had a preconceived idea
            in their head although we had spoken to them and provided them with information” (37).
         </p>
         <p>Interviews also highlighted that trial recruitment was being stopped early based on
            the statistical significance of the results at the interim analysis:
            
         </p>
         <p>“We finished earlier because we found that there were statistically significant differences
            and therefore we didn’t continue with more than 28 patients. If there were no statistical
            differences maybe we would have asked our agency to continue funding, but we found
            differences and it was good for us, very good news for us” (2).
         </p>
         <p>“The initial power calculation was for 60 patients and after 30 patients when we analysed
            the data we did see, you know a trend, benefit at 6 months so we felt let’s publish
            and go for it. If I didn’t see any differences I would have probably continued to
            enrol patients – if I didn’t see anything to publish” (34).
         </p>
         <p>For six trials, although the sample size was achieved it was not without recruitment
            difficulties, mostly linked to poor planning of the trial. Trialists reported problems
            with participant eligibility, either because of inclusion criteria being too tight
            (n = 3) or because changes in clinical practice led to changes in the eligibility
            of certain populations (n = 1):
            
         </p>
         <p>“The percentage of people who actually agreed was remarkably high, I think two thirds
            of everybody approached agreed to be in the study. The problem was finding them to
            approach them and that required a fairly intensive effort. We had to have teams of
            people waiting in the medical offices for a person of the right age, and that turned
            out to be much harder than we had thought, and we eventually had to add more staff
            and add more clinics to reach our sample size” (15).
         </p>
         <p>“When we did the pilot study we were recruiting from the emergency department and
            were able to get phone consent from parents when they weren’t present in the emergency
            department. Between that trial and this trial the hospital changed its rules and we
            had to have in-person signed parental consent before we could start the assessment
            and intervention with the children, and that made things a lot more difficult in terms
            of recruitment and enrolment” (13).
         </p>
         <p>In addition, trialists reported practical difficulties in running a trial, either
            because of difficulties collecting outcome data (n = 4), problems associated with
            the randomisation process (n = 1), difficulty recruiting research staff (n = 1) and
            revisions required post-pilot phase (n = 1). Concerns were also raised regarding the
            level of adverse outcomes, even when lower than expected:
            
         </p>
         <p>“Even though we had said a 20% mortality for study suspension or closure and we were
            not at that, it was still felt that probably the number was too high and there was
            just general concern about the extent of early mortality in this study” (58).
         </p>
         <p>“Just looking at the raw data without knowing what treatment they were assigned, you
            could see there was poor efficacy overall. So at that point we got someone independent
            (statistician) to look at the data and there was absolutely no difference at all.
            Then what we did was say if there was a tiny difference do a power calculation on
            how many patients you need to recruit to see a small difference and you need something
            like 500 – so we knew there was no point recruiting further patients. Together we,
            with the PI, we decided there was no point going on with this. We discussed it with
            the statistician and we all agreed there was no point continuing because there was
            such a strong signal that it was negative” (46).
         </p>
         <p>This trialist indicates that although they were blinded to intervention allocation
            they nonetheless had access to outcome data. The trialist goes on to describe the
            approach taken by the study team, which was to decide as a group to stop the trial.
         </p>
         <p>In about half the trials (n = 30) there were no issues with recruitment or retention,
            in three cases the sample size being achieved earlier than expected. Some groups performed
            pilot studies, which assisted in predicting and preventing problems prior to the trial
            starting. One group had forecast recruitment difficulties but decided to go ahead
            anyway, in order to secure funding (n = 1):

         <p>“The grant they gave us was the maximum so we put together a proposal that could make
            best of that knowing it was unlikely that we would achieve what we wanted to achieve
            within that money, and I think the funder knew that as well, so they were very forthcoming
            when we asked for an extension” (30).

            <h3>Issues around getting the research published</h3>
         </div>
         <p>Trialists were asked about the process of publishing the primary paper from the trial.
            Thirty-five (59%) trialists had their manuscript accepted at first submission; twenty-three
            had their manuscripts rejected at first submission, one trialist could not recall
            if accepted at first submission. The most common reasons given by the trialists for
            rejection at first submission were related to study design (n = 13), non-significant
            results (n = 3), not fitting with the topic areas of the journals approached (n = 2),
            or trialists unable to recall reason/no reason by journal given (n = 5).
         </p>
         <p>Trialists reported that the impact factors of journals and their kudos within the
            clinical specialty where they worked generally dictated which journal they approached
            first for publication: “It’s the most prestigious journal in our field; it has the
            highest citation value of any journal in our field” (53). Some authors were forced
            to opt for lower impact factor journals due to methodological issues (that is, ending
            recruitment early, or failing to recruit the pre-specified number of patients): “For
            the kind of journals which are high impact factor; unfortunately they wouldn’t take
            a paper like this for two reasons – one which is valid is that it was stopped prematurely
            and because it’s not positive and negative trials are quite difficult to publish.
            So the high impact journals we thought probably wouldn’t take it” (46).
         </p>
         <p>Several trialists reported feeling restricted by word limits imposed by journals and
            highlighted the implications for reporting of all outcomes:
            
         </p>
         <p>“The reviewers do not want us to report on all the outcomes, if the journals would
            allow us to publish longer papers and were interested in reading longer papers I would
            be happy to report on all possible outcomes. Secondly, there is limitation in terms
            of pages, in terms of tables, in terms of words that you can submit” (41).
         </p>
         <p>For one trialist there was little guidance given by the journal regarding what aspects
            of the paper were to be omitted, and therefore the reporting of results was not affected:
            
         </p>
         <p>“We were asked to cut the paper, they did not give us specific direction on what to
            cut they just told us to cut it, none of the analysis were removed” (13).
         </p>
         <p>A number of trialists cited problems with journal peer review as influencing the final
            version of the manuscript, one in particular citing the problem of competing interests
            amongst peer reviewers:
            
         </p>
         <p>“My recollection was we had three very positive reports and one that was very bad,
            and I know who that was from, that was one of our competitors, but it was so obvious
            who it was from” (38).
         </p>
         <p>Other trialists acknowledged issues around study design and inadequate sample size
            as problematic for publication:
            
         </p>
         <p>“I don’t think the referees liked the fact we didn’t have a placebo, so that was a
            design aspect. And the design was actually forced on us by the funders. Because this
            was a pragmatic trial, we actually put in for a placebo controlled efficacy trial,
            and the [funders] told us we should be doing an effectiveness or cost effectiveness
            trial” (20).
         </p>
         <p>“I think because the sample size was relatively small, and it was a negative study
            so they were concerned it wasn’t adequately powered to really answer the question”
            (5).
         </p>
         <p>In addition, some trialists thought that the lack of statistical significance of their
            findings impacted on the decision by the journal not to publish:
            
         </p>
         <p>“They declined it because it was a negative finding” (36).</p>
         <p>“We felt, if you’ve got a negative trial that perhaps people were less interested”
            (59).
         </p>
         <p>One trialist discussed several issues regarding rejection of their work, including
            that because the results were negative the journal editor vetoed publication, so giving
            publication bias as a suggestion of what had occurred:
            
         </p>
         <p>“It was actually quite disappointing, we went through two rounds of reviews and after
            an extensive re-write they rejected it, and I think the line was – you know that your
            work is interesting but fundamentally your results are negative. It’s like I know
            that, so it certainly was an exercise in learning more about publication bias. I was
            surprised at how blatantly the editor stated it, I mean he just said it’s interesting
            but your results are negative. At the time I was more irritated because he had wasted
            our time, because you know he would have known that reading the abstract in my first
            submission then we could have just ended this, it just wasted three months of my time”
            (56).
         </p>
         <p>In contrast, in considering their experience of getting their work published, a number
            of trialists described the constructive impact peer review had had on their manuscripts
            and felt that feedback ensured a more balanced manuscript:
            
         </p>
         <p>“Journal reviewers are quite helpful in getting a better finished product. Reviewers
            ask important questions and help to clarify things that as an author you have thought
            were perfectly clear” (5).
         </p>
         <p>“I think we probably, because the effect size was larger in the [intervention] group,
            we probably made it sound a little bit more positive in terms of our findings, that
            they wanted us to make sure that we toned it down to say that we really didn’t find
            many differences and that both of these treatments were pretty comparable in a lot
            of ways. I think that’s often the case, reviewers want to make sure you don’t claim
            more from your data than you can actually support” (23).

            <h3>Previous experience around publishing trial findings</h3>
         </div>
         <p>All but two trialists (due to time constraints of interview, n = 1; not performed
            a trial previously, n = 1) were asked directly whether they had ever chosen to not
            publish previously conducted trials. Over half the trialists (n = 33) stated that
            they themselves had never chosen not to publish data, even when the findings were
            unexpected, negative or unfavourable:
            
         </p>
         <p>“We have had a couple of failed studies, there was one study, it was supposed to be
            a huge trial, looking to recruit 1,800 men, and we closed after 2 years with 35 randomised,
            so clearly you are not going to get anything useful out of that, but you know I badgered
            and badgered and eventually we managed to write a research letter to an international
            journal, where we just presented the baseline characteristics of the patients that
            joined and we talked about the randomisation of patients and we presented some anecdotal
            information about why we thought the trial failed” (7).
         </p>
         <p>Three of the 33 trialists had, however, been involved as site investigators in industry-funded
            trials that were never published, one trialist reflecting on their experience as follows:
            
         </p>
         <p>“I can think of at least one trial that has not been published. I was not the PI,
            I was just a site investigator, that was an industry sponsored trial that has not
            been published. Not only was it a negative result but the study was stopped early
            because of safety. And that has not been published” (26).
         </p>
         <p>Those authors who had failed to publish any findings from a trial (n = 16) cited many
            reasons: negative study findings, lack of time, lack of resources, recruitment problem,
            rejection by journals, unclear results, or failure to complete the trial. Five trialists
            had published the primary, but not the secondary, outcome results:
            
         </p>
         <p>“I have certainly not published as many papers as we could have, but not deliberately
            – it’s usually lack of the soft money that by the time you are done the grant has
            run out and then you have got a new thing starting and you know one person can’t publish
            all the papers” (4).
         </p>
         <p>“The major problem was we were never able to recruit enough subjects for the study,
            and so the study got terminated and we were never able to make use of the data” (40).
         </p>
         <p>Three trialists were in the process of writing up their findings at the time of the
            interview, one of whom highlighted the potential for apathy in writing up negative
            findings and hence a potential significant time lag between completion and publication
            of negative trials:
            
         </p>
         <p>“Well I am actually struggling with it right now. I have an implementation trial and
            the results are negative and I am pushing myself along, I am taking longer to put
            it in than I should, and the paper is now drafted and we are working on the final
            references so it is going to go in, but you know I have to push myself pretty hard
            – I feel bored. And then I think sometimes people are really wedded to a hypothesis
            and they just don’t want the negative results out there” (15).

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Our study adds to the scant literature on trialists’ experiences of performing and
         publishing clinical trials in healthcare. We set out to explore researchers’ experiences
         and to identify which factors appeared to shape their experiences. We have provided
         an insight into the nature of the research process from the researcher’s perspective
         and our results confirm that the conduct and reporting of some trials can be inadequate.
         Nonetheless, our work has identified that aspects of clinical research can be inherently
         challenging.
      </p>
      <p>Our work has demonstrated that a substantial proportion of trialists identify outcome
         variables based on their clinical experience and knowing experts in the field. Thus
         our results concur with a previous study showing insufficient reference to previous
         research in the planning of a new trial 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. There appeared to be a general lack of consensus in most clinical settings regarding
         choice of appropriate outcomes. Problems associated with lack of consensus relate
         to lack of clarity regarding choice of outcome measures 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>, outcome reporting bias 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span> and selection of outcomes that may not be meaningful to clinicians 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">22</span>
         </span> or health service users

         </span>. Using standardised sets of outcomes to improve the standard of reporting and make
         it easier for the results of trials to be compared, contrasted and combined as appropriate
         is the focus of the COMET (Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials) Initiative
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

      </p>
      <p>Recruitment of participants into trials is critical for successful trial conduct.
         Not reaching the target sample size can mean that results are less reliable and so
         less useful in clinical practice. However, extending the timeframe for recruitment
         generally increases the costs of trials (the longer-term impact being that fewer trials
         can be conducted). However, recruiting participants to trials can be challenging 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">28</span>
         </span>. Our findings are consistent with previous studies revealing problems with trial
         recruitment, potential participants’ preferences, over estimation of recruitment potential
         and recruiting clinicians not being in equipoise. Work by others 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">29</span>
         </span> has revealed clinician barriers relating to time constraints (for example, time pressures
         from usual clinical practice as well as staffing and staff training), lack of research
         experience in clinicians, adverse effect on doctor-patient relationship, perceived
         conflict in their role as clinicians and researchers and perceived burden of trial
         for patients including travel distance and costs have all adversely affected recruitment
         to clinical trials.
      </p>
      <p>Work has been carried out to evaluate the relative effectiveness of recruitment strategies
         for participation in RCTs 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">27</span>
         </span>. Thirty-seven studies that compared methods of recruiting individual study participants
         into an actual trial or mock RCT were included. Strategies to increase participant
         awareness of the health problem under study, attendance at educational sessions, the
         addition of health questionnaires, or a video about the health condition, and monetary
         incentives were all found to improve recruitment. These findings lend further support
         to feasibility assessments and pilot trials being a potential solution to this problem.
      </p>
      <p>Conversely, the motivation of clinicians to participate in clinical trials in the
         UK has also been qualitatively studied 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">30</span>
         </span>. This work reports clinicians consider having an interest in the research question,
         intellectual curiosity and potential benefits to patients (including access to treatments
         or drugs, and closer monitoring) as opposed to payment for involvement are the most
         important factors 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">30</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>High-quality protocols facilitate proper conduct, reporting, and external review of
         clinical trials 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">31</span>
         </span>
         <sup>.</sup> However, our results confirm that the quality of trial protocols can be substandard.
         We found wide variation in the completeness of protocols, especially in relation to
         the study rationale, the proposed methods and trial organisation, and ethical considerations.
         There was also variation in the precise definition and scope of trial protocols; 16
         of our trialists could not provide a completed comprehensive document that included
         important information relating to study design. It is now widely acknowledged that
         every clinical trial requires a complete and transparent protocol to facilitate sound
         trial conduct 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">32</span>
         </span>. However, previous work has confirmed the widespread deficiency in protocol content
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">33</span>
         </span>-
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">35</span>
         </span>. In response to these shortcomings the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations
         for Interventional Trials) international initiative was developed 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">31</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">36</span>
         </span>. This initiative aims to improve the quality of clinical trial protocols by providing
         a minimum set of scientific, ethical, and administrative elements that should be addressed
         in a clinical trial protocol. The mechanism of journals requesting protocols to be
         submitted alongside the manuscript is one way of allowing a comparison of what was
         planned and what was actually done.
      </p>
      <p>Our trialists considered the prestige and impact factors of academic journals to be
         the most important criteria for selecting those to which they would submit manuscripts.
         This confirms work by others where the constituency of the readership, whether the
         journal usually published articles on the topic, and the likelihood of manuscript
         acceptance were also considered key criteria 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">37</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Peer reviewed publication is the final, essential step in any research project, providing
         legitimisation and credit for the work that has been done 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">38</span>
         </span>. We found there was a perception that journals were more or less interested in studies
         depending on the direction of the findings and the presence/absence of a so-called
         ‘negative’ result. In addition, several trialists experienced difficulties when writing
         up and getting their manuscripts published because of word limit restrictions for
         paper journals. Electronic journals allow authors to exceed the usual paper journal
         word limits. In addition, open access allows researchers to read and build on the
         findings of others without restriction. The NIHR HTA programme has a high publication
         rate and is the world’s first health research funder to publish comprehensive accounts
         of all of its research. The launch of the NIHR Journals Library follows the success
         of the HTA journal and aims at ensuring other participating NIHR programmes publish
         their research. All results are reported, whether they are positive, negative or neutral,
         minimising publication bias and maximises the usefulness of data in subsequent studies
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">39</span>
         </span>. Open access also means that teachers and their students have access to the latest
         research findings throughout the world, so acting as an important educational tool
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">40</span>
         </span>.
      </p>
      <p>Further difficulties associated with the editorial process were connected to peer
         review. There was evidence from the trialists’ accounts that competing interests amongst
         peer reviewers was a potential issue. Conflicts of interest by peer reviewers need
         to be taken more seriously by all 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">41</span>
         </span>. Reviewers need to declare all conflicts of interest, since competitive issues or
         personal relationships can lead to important and less obvious bias.
      </p>
      <p>Some of our trialists recognised the two principal functions in medical journal publishing
         as: to select reports for publication that meet scientific quality standards; and
         to improve presentation of research during the process of revision 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">42</span>
         </span>. Several investigators have studied changes to manuscripts during the editorial process
         and its impact on manuscript selection, these being mostly related to changes in readability
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">43</span>
         </span>, and the adequacy of statistical reporting 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">44</span>
         </span>. Our trialists confirmed that the peer review process had ensured their final published
         manuscript was a balanced account of the work performed. For example, it has been
         reported that authors often overemphasise study findings in an attempt to impress
         the journal with their importance 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span> and the trialists in this study acknowledged that the peer review process allowed
         for the recommendation that the findings were publishable if overstated conclusions
         were toned down.
      </p>
      <p>A substantial number of trialists disclosed that there had been occasions when they
         had not published previous research findings. Reasons provided included negative study
         findings (sometimes related to not achieving the sample size), or lack of time and
         resources. Our qualitative work is consistent with previous quantitative findings
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">14</span>
         </span> revealing that not reporting a study based on the strength and “direction” of its
         results - termed publication bias - is common. Trial results should be published whatever
         the outcome of the trial. However, it was apparent from trialists’ accounts that they
         were often genuinely unaware of the potential problems their decisions not to publish
         could cause. Importantly, we found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing by the trialists,
         but rather scientific naivety. Moreover, it appeared that the process through which
         trialists are required to journey is one of negotiating hurdles and responding to
         challenges that often cannot often be anticipated. Trialists sometimes have to adapt
         their research plans, in order to make their way through the complex research process,
         and may do so with little in-depth knowledge or formal training in research methodology.

            <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The strength of our study lies with its use of qualitative interviews to provide real
            insights into the lived experience of doing research across its natural history, from
            the perspective of the investigator. Our study adds to the evidence base on how trials
            are designed and conducted in practice 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">45</span>
            </span>-
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">47</span>
            </span>. Our findings are in accord with the issue of trial management being inherently complex.
            To review the literature, develop a protocol, apply for funding and design case report
            forms requires lengthy consultations and a considered approach 
            <span tagx="abbrgrp">
               <span tagx="abbr">7</span>
            </span>. Studies such as ours exploring all phases of clinical research offer transparency
            about the process which, in turn, may help to identify aspects where procedures or
            education will help to reduce bias, improve credibility of results and cultivate the
            efficient management of trials.
         </p>
         <p>We have presented the experiences of only those who agreed to be interviewed and who,
            perhaps, represent researchers with a particular interest in adhering to sound research
            procedures. As noted earlier, a significant proportion of those declining participation
            were funded by the pharmaceutical industry, which may itself represent a source of
            bias. Nonetheless, our trialist participants did come from a wide range of clinical
            specialties, research experience and countries, supporting the generalisability of
            our findings. In addition, we acknowledge the low acceptance rates from both sources
            of recruitment (21% from Cochrane reviews selected for the ORBIT project and 25% from
            randomly selected published trials indexed on PubMed). A number of trialists declined
            our offer of interview without giving a reason, which may mean that the true picture
            is worse than described; in addition there were those who were unable to locate the
            trial protocol - itself suggestive of poor research practice

         <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Our work has identified that aspects of clinical research can be inherently challenging,
         in particular with regard to establishing appropriate and relevant outcomes to measure,
         the use of and adherence to study protocols, recruitment of study participants and
         the reporting and publishing of the study findings. To ensure clinical relevance and
         minimise questionable research practices, it is crucial that measures are taken to
         optimise the reliability of studies that are conducted. Potential solutions to the
         problems associated with poor trial design, conduct and substandard reporting practices
         include: the development of systems to support and train researchers in trial methodology
         and processes, such as those being provided by the UK Clinical Research Network 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">48</span>
         </span>, and the development of research ‘toolkits’ such as The Clinical Trial Toolkit 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">49</span>
         </span> and The Guide to Efficient Trial Management 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">50</span>
         </span>. Additional means to improve trial conduct includes support from the UKCRC Registered
         Clinical Trials Units (CTUs). Since 2007, all UK National Health Service trials are
         strongly encouraged by funders to involve CTU expertise. The CTUs have the capability
         for centrally coordinating multicentre clinical trials, as well as for trial design,
         data management, and analysis 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">51</span>
         </span>. Improving the reporting quality of trials should include: registering clinical trials
         at their inception in a publicly accessible database 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">52</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">53</span>
         </span>; the adoption of evidence-based reporting guidelines, such as the CONSORT statement
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">54</span>
         </span> and the PRISMA statement 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">55</span>
         </span>; an evidence-based minimum set of reporting items in systematic reviews and meta-analyses,
         in addition to research ethics committees having a clear remit to ensure the responsible
         conduct of research; and insistence by journal editors on the submission of a trial
         protocol alongside the manuscript 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">56</span>
         </span>. Implementation of such strategies to support trial management will not only benefit
         trialists and the broader research community, but also the end-users of trials, namely
         the patients they seek to serve.
