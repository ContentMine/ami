               </div>
               <p>Aphasia affects the ability to speak, comprehend spoken language, read and write.
                  One third of stroke survivors experience aphasia. Evidence suggests that aphasia can
                  continue to improve after the first few months with intensive speech and language
                  therapy, which is frequently beyond what resources allow. The development of computer
                  software for language practice provides an opportunity for self-managed therapy. This
                  pragmatic randomised controlled trial will investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness
                  of a computerised approach to long-term aphasia therapy post stroke.

                  <h3>Methods/Design</h3>
               </div>
               <p>A total of 285 adults with aphasia at least four months post stroke will be randomly
                  allocated to either usual care, computerised intervention in addition to usual care
                  or attention and activity control in addition to usual care. Those in the intervention
                  group will receive six months of self-managed word finding practice on their home
                  computer with monthly face-to-face support from a volunteer/assistant. Those in the
                  attention control group will receive puzzle activities, supplemented by monthly telephone
                  calls.
               </p>
               <p>Study delivery will be coordinated by 20 speech and language therapy departments across
                  the United Kingdom. Outcome measures will be made at baseline, six, nine and 12 months
                  after randomisation by blinded speech and language therapist assessors. Primary outcomes
                  are the change in number of words (of personal relevance) named correctly at six months
                  and improvement in functional conversation. Primary outcomes will be analysed using
                  a Hochberg testing procedure. Significance will be declared if differences in both
                  word retrieval and functional conversation at six months are significant at the 5%
                  level, or if either comparison is significant at 2.5%. A cost utility analysis will
                  be undertaken from the NHS and personal social service perspective. Differences between
                  costs and quality-adjusted life years in the three groups will be described and the
                  incremental cost effectiveness ratio will be calculated. Treatment fidelity will be
                  monitored.

         <h2>Background</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Stroke is the largest cause of disability in the United Kingdom with communication
         impairment affecting one third of survivors 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span>. Aphasia is the most common communication impairment acquired post stroke. It is
         a disorder of language which may affect understanding, expression, reading and writing.
         Speech and language therapy (SLT) is often received regularly initially but rarely
         continues after the first few months. Medical instability, fatigue and confusion may
         reduce full engagement with language therapy in the early weeks post stroke, reducing
         the opportunity for people to participate in treatment. There is evidence that people
         can continue to improve their language skills for several years 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. As the consequences of aphasia remain a problem long term, investigation of interventions
         to reduce this health burden in the chronic stages post stroke is crucial. The National
         Stroke Strategy 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">1</span>
         </span> recommends people receive rehabilitation for as long as they benefit from it. Treatment
         of aphasia that persists beyond the first few months post stroke is often not available
         through NHS services in the United Kingdom as ongoing therapy is costly through face-to-face
         SLT and places greater demands on limited resources.
      </p>
      <p>Meta-analysis in a Cochrane review 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span> of SLT for aphasia following stroke suggests some effectiveness of aphasia therapy
         
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">2</span>
         </span>. Adequately powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this field are rare except
         for recent studies of SLT intervention in the first few weeks post stroke. Laska 
         <i>et al</i>. 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">3</span>
         </span> randomised 123 patients with aphasia to receive 45 minutes of SLT a day for 21 days,
         starting within two days of stroke onset, or no SLT intervention. Severity of the
         aphasia was not reduced. A recently completed study, ACT NoW 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>
         </span>, randomised 170 people in hospital post stroke to SLT intervention or attention control
         (informal conversation with paid visitors) for up to four months. No significant differences
         between groups were shown and the authors suggested that the intervention may have
         been provided too early in the stroke pathway. As aphasia persists for many stroke
         survivors, therapy in the longer term also warrants investigation using adequately
         powered RCTs. Although rapid spontaneous recovery may occur in the first few months,
         there is preliminary evidence to suggest targeted and intensive SLT treatments can
         promote further improvement in the latter months 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

      </p>
      <p>Targeted therapies with good preliminary evidence to date include constraint induced
         aphasia therapy (CIAT); use of language in games to make, reject or clarify requests
         for targeted items for 30 hours over 2 weeks 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">9</span>
         </span>. A systematic review of 10 studies conducted over the decade concluded that evidence
         for this technique is favourable 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">10</span>
         </span>. Model oriented aphasia therapy (MOAT), which tailors treatment according to a patient’s
         individual symptoms, was found to be comparable to CIAT when delivered with similar
         intensity 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">11</span>
         </span>. Raymer 
         <i>et al</i>. found personal relevance or ‘salience’ of the language material being practiced
         to be important when targeting therapy 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">6</span>
         </span>. While the optimum intensity remains unclear, it is generally acknowledged that for
         stroke rehabilitation regular, repetitive therapy practice is a factor in treatment
         success.
      </p>
      <p>The resources required to achieve intensive therapy in the long term is prohibitive
         in the current financial climate and lower cost options for the support of repetitive
         intensive practice are needed. Non-speech and language therapy professionals have
         been employed successfully to support therapy activity 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">4</span>

      </p>
      <p>Computer therapy, developed for the treatment of aphasia, has been reported to be
         useful in the provision of targeted language practice and provides opportunities for
         independent home practice as part of a self-management approach to maximise practice
         intensity, improving outcomes for reading, spelling and expressive language 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">18</span>
         </span>. However, to date, studies of self-managed computer therapy for aphasia have been
         limited to descriptive case series with only three reported RCTs; two for treatment
         of reading disorders and one for treatment of word finding 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
         </span>,
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">19</span>
         </span>. Although these studies were not fully powered, they indicate potential effectiveness
         of computer therapy. Such computer-based services for long term management of aphasia
         therapy could provide a low cost therapy option which is acceptable to patients and
         families. However, the actual cost effectiveness has not been definitively tested.
      </p>
      <p>The StepbyStep© computerised approach to long term aphasia therapy combines current
         evidence underpinning language therapy with practical considerations of treatment
         delivery. Skills of a qualified speech and language therapist are used to select individually
         targeted therapy exercises, computer software is provided for regular self-managed
         practice of therapy exercises and volunteers or assistant SLTs support language practice
         and computer use 
         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">20</span>
         </span>. A pilot study evaluating this approach was carried out with 34 people with persistent
         aphasia. They were randomly assigned to using computer software designed for treating
         aphasia, or usual long term care (most frequently this was social support). On average
         people with aphasia practiced their speech exercises on the computer independently
         for 25 hours over five months. The therapy showed statistically significant improvement
         in the ability to use spoken words when compared to usual care (
         <i>P</i> = 0.014). The results indicated that self-managed computer therapy supported by volunteers
         (a total of four hours on average) could help people with aphasia to continue to practise,
         improving their vocabulary and confidence talking

         <span tagx="abbrgrp">
            <span tagx="abbr">21</span>
         </span>. Self-managed computer therapy could therefore improve the quality of life of people
         with persistent aphasia at relatively low cost, and exploratory economic analysis
         has suggested considerable potential for the intervention to prove cost effective

      <p>The aim of this study is to provide definitive evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness
         of targeted, intensive speech and language impairment-based therapy intervention for
         word finding delivered through self-managed computer exercise for persisting post-stroke
         aphasia. This builds on the pilot RCT which explored possible effects, and informed
         measures, feasibility, recruitment rates, adherence, cost effectiveness analysis and
         a power calculation. The current study was commissioned by the United Kingdom National
         Institute for Health Research, having considered the limitations in the current evidence
         base.

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The primary objectives of the study are:</p>
         <p>1. To establish whether self-managed computerised speech and language therapy for
            aphasia related word finding problems after stroke increases the ability to use vocabulary
            of personal importance (impairment).
         </p>
         <p>2. To establish whether self-managed computerised speech and language therapy for
            word finding problems after stroke improves functional communication ability in conversation
            (activity).
         </p>
         <p>3. To investigate whether patients receiving self-managed computerised speech and
            language therapy perceive greater changes in social participation and quality of life
            (participation).
         </p>
         <p>4. To establish whether self-managed computerised speech and language therapy is cost
            effective for persistent aphasia post stroke.
         </p>
         <p>5. To identify whether any effects of the intervention are evident 12 months after
            therapy has begun.
         </p>
         <p>Secondary objectives include investigating the generalisation of treatment to retrieval
            of untreated words (impairment); the use of treated words in conversation; the carer
            perception of communication effectiveness (participation) and identification of any
            possible adverse events. Carers’ own quality of life will be measured. Fidelity to
            treatment will also be monitored.

            <h3>Design</h3>
         </div>
         <p>The study will use a pragmatic, parallel group randomised controlled adjunct trial
            design. The intervention under test or attention control will be delivered in addition
            to usual care. Outcomes will be compared for people who are four months or more post
            stroke, with persistent aphasia who are randomly allocated to either: usual care,
            self-managed computerised speech and language therapy in addition to usual care or
            attention control in addition to usual care.
         </p>
         <p>Each participant will be in the trial for 12 months. Participants will be identified
            and recruited over an 18-month period in total, and 15 months at each site. Each participant
            will receive their intervention for six months, with follow-up at six, nine and 12 months.
            The study has an internal pilot phase with criteria for progression to completion
            of the full RCT. There are no formal statistical criteria for stopping the trial early.
            Decisions to stop the trial early on grounds of safety or futility will be made by
            independent data management and ethics committee members. The protocol conforms to
            the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for non-pharmacological
            studies (Figure

               about the study. If they are interested, the research speech and language therapist
               will make an appointment to visit them at home. The number of those contacted but
               who cannot be followed up on or who are not interested in learning more and the reason

            </div>
            <p>Eligibility will be established on the first visit. The speech and language therapist
               will request verbal consent to carry out the Naming Objects subtest of the Comprehensive
               Aphasia Test

               finding deficit. If the word finding score is less than 10%, or greater than 90%,
               an explanation will be given that this type of computer therapy is not suitable for
               them. If the potential participant has eligible word finding scores, the research
               speech and language therapist will ask them to try a simple repetition task to confirm
               their repetition ability, followed by a matching task on the computer to confirm ability
               to see the screen and perform simple computer related actions.

               <h4>Recruitment</h4>
            </div>
            <p>The level of support required to enable a person with aphasia to provide informed
               consent is dependent upon the severity and profile of the aphasia. In order to provide
               information in a format consistent with each individual's language ability, a consent
               support tool (CST) will be used 
               <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                  <span tagx="abbr">25</span>
               </span>. The research speech and language therapist at each site will request verbal consent
               from the potential participant to carry out part A of the CST. The result will indicate
               the style of information they are most likely to understand in part B. Participants
               will be given sufficient time to consider their participation before informed consent
               is taken by a research speech and language therapist. Participants providing their
               own informed consent will be provided with an aphasia-friendly consent form. If potential
               participants with severe aphasia indicate an interest, a relative (in Scotland this
               will be the person’s legal representative or nearest relative) will be asked to read
               an information sheet detailing their responsibility, and will be asked to sign a carer
               declaration on behalf of their relative with aphasia (in Scotland they will be asked
               to sign a consent form). For those participants with a carer, the carer will be asked
               if they are willing to complete some outcome measures related to their own quality
               of life and perception of their relative’s communication ability. They will be provided
               with the carer information sheet detailing their potential involvement and will be
               asked to sign a separate consent form. Informed consent will be obtained from each
               participant where they are able to give it, or consent or carer declaration will be
               obtained by the carer or legal representative where the participant is interested
               in participating, but is unable to provide their own fully informed consent.

            </div>
            <p>Following baseline assessment, the participant will be randomised to one of the three
               trial intervention arms. Randomisation will be performed by an online randomisation
               system developed and maintained through the Sheffield Clinical Trials Research Unit
               (CTRU). The randomisation sequence will be generated in advance by the trial statistician.
               Randomisation will be stratified by centre (as heterogeneity between centres is expected),
               and according to severity of word retrieval at baseline, based on percentage scores
               on the Naming Objects subtest of the Comprehensive Aphasia Test (severe = 10 to 34%,
               moderate = 35 to 64%, and mild = 65 to 90%). The research speech and language therapist
               will then inform the participant which group they have been allocated to and draw
               their attention to the description of this group in the information sheet.

            </div>
            <p>This is a single blind study. The patient participants are not blind to their treatment
               allocation. The speech and language therapists performing baseline assessments will
               do this prior to randomisation. A second speech and language therapist at each site,
               blinded to group allocation, will perform follow-up assessments. The speech and language
               therapist setting up the treatment will ask participants not to discuss treatment
               with the person coming to carry out the follow-up measures. It is possible that unblinding
               will happen during conversation and the speech and language therapists will be asked
               to record instances of this. A primary outcome is functional communication in conversation.
               Video recordings of conversations will be presented in random order to speech and
               language therapists in the project coordinating centre to rate, blind to treatment
               allocation and follow-up time. The chief investigator, study manager, statisticians
               and health economist will all be blind to group allocation.

               </div>
               <p>Usual care for this pragmatic study may consist of participation in a range of activities
                  to a greater or lesser extent. Usual care varies across the country in terms of type,
                  frequency and length of provision, and is dependent upon available resources in each
                  locality. Findings from the pilot study confirmed that usual care for four months
                  or more following a stroke may include: face-to-face speech and language therapy targeting
                  language impairment (reading, writing, speaking or understanding); therapy focussing
                  on compensatory communication strategies, provision of communication aids or psychological
                  support; attendance at voluntary support groups or informal communication support
                  from family and friends. Usual care will be recorded retrospectively for three months
                  prior to the study and throughout the study on the case report forms for all groups.
                  Those who are randomised to the usual care group will not receive any project specific
                  intervention.

               </div>
               <p>A structured intervention is proposed in addition to usual care as tested in the pilot
                  study. The intervention targets word retrieval as it is one of the challenges most
                  frequently experienced by people with aphasia, restricting their communication. The
                  three components of the intervention are as follows:
               </p>
               <p> Qualified speech and language therapist assessment, tailoring of exercises and monitoring</p>
               <p>The speech and language therapist at each site will tailor computer exercises to the
                  individual using 100 words of personal relevance chosen by the participant. Photographs
                  imaging the 100 words will be selected from those existing in the software, or can
                  be added from a digital camera or from image stores on a computer. The computer software
                  (StepbyStep© by Steps Consulting Ltd, Gloucester, UK) 
                  <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                     <span tagx="abbr">30</span>
                  </span> enables the speech and language therapist to select exercises using these words that
                  follow steps in the therapy process that the therapist would take if delivering it
                  face to face. The speech and language therapist bases the selection of exercises on
                  language skills demonstrated in the initial language assessments. The speech and language
                  therapist will provide initial demonstration of the software exercises, check that
                  the individual is able to use the software and monitor the appropriateness of the
                  tailored exercises. This is expected to take only three to four hours, based on the
                  pilot study 
                  <span tagx="abbrgrp">
                     <span tagx="abbr">13</span>
                  </span>, as the computer intervention is predominantly self-managed by the patient.
               </p>
               <p> Regular self-managed practice</p>
               <p>The participant will then be asked to work through the exercises on the computer and
                  be encouraged to practise each day for 20 to 30 minutes. Participants will be given
                  a six-month period to work though the therapy material on the computer and practise
                  using the new vocabulary in their daily lives. As this is a pragmatic trial, those
                  participants who have the software installed on their own computers will not be prevented
                  from continuing to practise if they wish, following the six-month supported intervention
                  time. Any continued use of software beyond the six months will be recorded.
               </p>
               <p> Volunteer support to assist with treatment adherence and carry over into daily activity</p>
               <p>To enhance treatment adherence, the speech and language therapist will provide training
                  to local volunteers who already have a working relationship with the SLT department
                  or SLT assistants based in the department. They will use the three-hour training programme
                  and instruction book (University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK) developed and evaluated
                  during the pilot study. The volunteer will be asked to visit the participant once
                  a month for an hour, or every two weeks for half an hour (to suit the patient), carrying
                  out the following tasks: provide technical assistance; observe and encourage use of
                  computer exercises; check results and discuss difficulties; assist the participant
                  to move on to harder tasks in the therapy process pre-programmed by the speech and
                  language therapist; encourage the use of new words in everyday situations, conversation
                  and discussions with family about how to encourage use and encourage re-use of completed
                  exercises over time.
               </p>
               <p>The participants will be able to contact the volunteer or SLTA by telephone for technical
                  advice on computer use between planned visits if necessary. Volunteers and SLTAs will
                  be asked to complete a feedback form on each face-to-face session with a participant
                  and send it to the therapist to enable them to provide tailored advice and support.
                  They therapists are also encouraged to meet with all the volunteers/SLTAs together
                  every two months for support and discussion of issues arising.
               </p>
               <p>The majority of the practice time involved in the intervention is self-managed by
                  the participant through regular use of the aphasia computer software. The therapists,
                  SLTAs and volunteers will be asked to keep diaries of resource use showing direct
                  and indirect (telephone and computer set up) time spent and therapist grade (see Table 
                  <span tagx="tblr">1</span>).

               <p>Participants randomised to this arm will be provided with generalised activities to
                  carry out and general attention in addition to usual care. On allocation to this group,
                  the speech and language therapists conducting baseline assessments will provide books
                  of standard puzzles that can be purchased from most supermarkets or high street shops.
                  Each book will contain enough activities for one to be carried out each day for at
                  least a month. Examples of puzzles include getting through a maze, spotting the difference
                  between pictures, matching objects that are the same, word searches, Sudoku and so
                  forth. The SLT will provide age appropriate puzzle books that match the participant’s
                  linguistic ability as indicated by the baseline assessments. Puzzle books will be
                  colour coded into levels of easy, medium and hard by the clinicians on the research
                  team centrally and a leaflet will be provided to give speech and language therapists

                  similar to that given by volunteers in the intervention arm. They will ask if they
                  are enjoying the activities, how many they have managed to do, whether they would
                  like a new puzzle book sent to them for the coming month and whether they would like
                  the same level of difficulty or an easier or harder one. The participants will also
                  have access to these contact details to enable them to ask for easier or harder books
                  at any time if necessary, again, mimicking the access to the volunteers and SLTAs
                  and type of attention available in the intervention arm.

            </div>
            <p>The speech and language therapists delivering this intervention will receive training
               on how to set up appropriate exercise steps. To enable monitoring of the treatment
               fidelity, they will be asked to complete a checklist which guides their selection
               of exercises based on the participant language profile identified during assessment.
               These will be reviewed centrally by the study quality monitor. Encrypted and anonymised
               key files from the participants’ software will be returned to the study team to enable
               comparison of a random selection of exercises provided with the corresponding checklist
               completed.
            </p>
            <p>As this is a self-managed intervention, adherence of the participants in using the
               intervention as intended will be monitored. This will be achieved through volunteer
               or assistant visits with reminders to practise daily and assistance with using the
               full range of exercises set. The speech and language therapist will also monitor practice
               through feedback forms provided by the volunteer or assistant. In addition, the software
               key files returned to the study coordinating team centrally will be reviewed for total
               practice time and patterns of practice over the six-month treatment period. Practice
               with the computer for a minimum of 20 minutes three times a week at home on average
               will be considered per protocol to account for periods of illness and holiday. Volunteer
               and assistant adherence will be monitored through their feedback forms to the speech
               and language therapists who will record amounts of support provided. A minimum of
               four hours in total per patient will be considered per protocol. Adherence to the
               attention control group will be monitored by recording information regarding the number
               of puzzles completed and the frequency and duration of telephone support calls received.
               Usual care will be recorded across the study period for all groups.

            <p>We developed a Markov model to estimate the cost effectiveness of the computer intervention

         <h2>Discussion</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Chronic aphasia has a considerable impact on a person’s ability to participate in
         many personal, social and work activities. Despite evidence of the potential for continued
         language improvement over time with intensive practice of targeted, salient language
         therapy exercises, opportunities to participate in such ongoing therapy are limited
         due to resource pressures. There is preliminary evidence of the potential for computer
         software developed for aphasia therapy to provide new opportunities for ongoing aphasia
         therapy for patients to participate in for as long as they wish and/or benefit. Indeed,
         there is an increase in the software options being developed for independent language
         practice. In order for health services or private practitioners and the public to
         invest in this option it is crucial to know whether such interventions are clinically
         and cost effective. This protocol describes the first fully powered RCT of long term
         aphasia therapy delivered through self-managed computerised language exercises, with
         the support of volunteers or assistants. The protocol also describes the process for
         the first full economic analysis of a computerised aphasia intervention.
      </p>
      <p>The therapy under investigation is a complex intervention of word finding therapy
         for aphasia. Previous studies, including the pilot study informing this protocol,
         have shown that people with aphasia learn the words that are meaningful to them more
         successfully than those they have little functional need for. As in many rehabilitation
         interventions, this therapy is driven by the patient’s own goals. Communication needs
         to achieve different goals are discussed with the therapist and a range of words key
         to achieving those goals are identified. The personalisation of the therapy goals
         requires some personalisation in the measurement of whether they have been achieved.
         The design of outcome measures which can be used to make group comparisons whilst
         maintaining accurate measurement of individual goals was a challenge. Discussions
         resulted in two primary outcome measures. The first measures word finding ability
         whereby all participants have comparable word finding scores from naming 100 pictures.
         Measurement of word finding of personally meaningful and useful words is achieved
         by allowing the 100 words to be different for each individual according to their goals.
         Similarly, the second measures ability to communicate in conversation. All conversations
         are rated using the activity scale of the TOMS so group comparisons can be made. Measurement
         of individual goals is maintained by structuring the conversations around the communication
         areas identified as personally relevant by each individual.
      </p>
      <p>Other key issues in designing the protocol arose from the pragmatic nature of the
         study. First of all, in order to recruit sufficient numbers of participants, at least
         20 speech and language departments are required across the United Kingdom. This will
         allow generalisation of the results to the population of the United Kingdom. However,
         we expect considerable variation in the usual care provided to people with aphasia
         in the long term post stroke, with some sites providing impairment based interventions
         face to face for several months, and others limiting their service provision to hospital
         care or for a few weeks post-hospital discharge only. The intervention being tested
         could be implemented in addition to any existing services in practice. The study therefore
         uses an adjunct design whereby patients continue to receive any ongoing care. This
         may have the added benefit of recruiting those patients who would not wish to be randomised
         away from usual care. To account for the heterogeneity expected, the randomisation
         is to be stratified by site, ensuring representation of different models of usual
         care in each study group.
      </p>
      <p>There are challenges in involving people with aphasia in research, as they often have
         difficulty reading or understanding spoken language. The protocol for obtaining informed
         consent therefore needed careful consideration. In order to adhere to the Mental Capacity
         Act (2005) in England and the Adults with Incapacity Act (2000) in Scotland, a consent
         support tool has been included to identify reading and spoken comprehension ability
         of individuals and recommend the style of information that is likely to best inform
         each individual. The tool also identifies those participants whose aphasia severity
         is such that they are unlikely to understand the information sufficiently to provide
         informed consent and therefore need the involvement of a carer, relative or legal
         representative. In addition, the reading deficits make completion of standard questionnaire
         tools such as the EQ-5D difficult and unreliable. We therefore developed and tested
         an accessible EQ-5D which uses illustrations and visually represented extent of difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>There are three groups in the study. Introducing a three-way comparison increases
         the required sample size and therefore poses a potential threat to the power of the
         study if recruitment is insufficient. However, a three-way comparison is not required
         here as the first question to answer is whether the computerised intervention is more
         effective than usual care alone. Only if the answer to the first question is positive
         is there a need to ask whether it is the speech and language therapy components that
         cause the effectiveness shown. In this case a second comparison of computer intervention
         to activity and/or attention control needs to be carried out. The Hochberg analysis
         was chosen to allow for these consecutive comparisons, thus also maintaining a more
         achievable sample size.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, the set-up of 20 individual speech and language therapy departments to participate
         in the study is a considerable challenge, in which service support and excess treatment
         costs must be negotiated at each site independently, with a large range of local policies
         and financial restrictions across the United Kingdom.
